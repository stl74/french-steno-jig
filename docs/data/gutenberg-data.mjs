"Then all was still.",
"She was still there.",
"A new world was his.",
"This was new.",
"It was different.",
"But why?",
"Think what they would say!",
"But he does both.",

"It was a very different thing now.",

"This way.",

"As before.",
"Come, now!",
"Take that!",

"Was he about to use it?",
"What should she do now?",
"That may be so.",
"What does it all mean?",
"What a story it is!",
"That was why they did it.",
"How will it all end?",
"No use!",
"But we did not see the end.",
"How does it look now?",
"Look at me!",
"Yes, yes, yes!",
"What then made me do it?",
"I should think so!",
"Most probably they do.",
"They are very good to her.",
"What it was, however, I could not, for the life of me, make out.",
"I should say not.",
"What more need be said!",
"Where are they found?",
"A few have more than this.",
"But they did not come!",
"But at last we were over.",
"It is not of this world.",
"And we had need of them.",
"Yes, so I would.",
"Come to the point.",
"Never be that.",
"With me it is different.",
"I have made sure of that.",
"It was very still.",
"I had thought what to say.",
"Here they come, to be sure.",
"It might be different if he were still with us.",
"Take him out!",
"I did not want her money.",
"What, then, should he do?",
"There was no family.",
"Why not use them?",
"Good day!",
"That is not to be thought of.",
"Not more than I want to see him.",
"Go and see the world.",
"Should he go and see?",
"They could not be going to part.",
"That was very kind.",
"This, however, he did not do.",
"But to go back.",
"Now, why do I say all this?",
"How are we to look at it?",
"I do not say that it should not be so.",
"They know not why.",
"Be not too sure of that.",
"But what does that mean?",
"So it always was, so it always will be.",
"Why is it so?",
"Then they will have what they want if they will take the right way to get it.",
"They will not come.",
"I say it is.",
"That is what we need to be.",
"That, and I think a little more.",
"And what right thing?",
"As for what he is to do next, he will think little of that.",
"He had to do like us.",
"That is all I can say.",
"I did not make it so.",
"What do I mean?",
"But how many?",
"It will probably, too, always be so.",
"He would have had all new.",
"But what after all if he should be right in part at least?",
"It was not always so.",
"But why not?",
"Now, look here.",
"We find way.",
"And why should I do so?",
"His world was not their world.",
"It was not long.",
"But why should it be?",
"Why the next?",
"I will here end.",
"I have had my day.",
"I come, I come.",
"Do look about for them.",
"Think of these things.",
"It is not too big.",
"By the way, I like her.",
"There are not now the years that there used to be.",
"Where will these things end?",
"We found him in.",
"What a thought!",
"But, yes!",
"Now I can go home.",
"Never was, and never will be.",
"My family!",
"She has got to go.",
"But to each his own.",
"This was a good time of the year.",
"This time she did not look around.",
"Can I look at him?",
"Here is the time, now or never.",
"Had he been there before?",
"I should think I do.",
"Who put me into it?",
"For money, too!",
"And very little of it would have come in our time.",
"At last it was time to go.",
"But he did not say it.",
"Take her out.",
"Come in, however.",
"I have never been like that before.",
"He did not say what he would do when he had found out.",
"But it will not be for long.",
"They are going to be.",
"I should like to be there to see.",
"We only know there is something.",
"Without these, what was she?",
"He is still at it.",
"No, it is different for me.",
"This is such a time.",
"They are his own people.",
"And this was the end of all!",
"It did not last long.",
"Go and take it!",
"She had been down here.",
"It was sure to come.",
"But it will not come in our time.",
"Will he come?",
"No need.",
"Home, to me, home!",
"And so say I!",
"But he had a way with him.",
"More was to come.",
"But the other way is all right too.",
"I want to be sure.",
"And he had come just in time.",
"But this was different.",
"It has always been so.",
"Even that is too big for us.",
"She said she was not at home.",
"It is real!",
"What could I say?",
"But it was not for long.",
"They are very good.",
"They that be against it are more than they that be for it.",
"By the same.",
"It may be, or it may not be.",
"He should not have said it.",
"That will take much too long.",
"What should I do?",
"Look, look!",
"There are such a lot of them.",
"Look at him!",
"This I found to be good.",
"They were put there.",
"Few of them have any money.",
"I could only point.",
"Come, all!",
"Back, I say!",
"But come, look up.",
"Why make it at all?",
"Make the most of it!",
"Now the time has come when I mean to do it.",
"But they were too many for him!",
"They had not been long about it!",
"It is a way I have!",
"There are but few of them now.",
"So she might, but what then?",
"They were not always like that.",
"But was it such?",
"Never, never can it be!",
"Look up!",
"Why so?",
"Many did both on the same day.",
"Because of their number?",
"She might need it, she thought.",
"Take him out there!",
"Why then?",
"Look down!",
"Then he got up.",
"But it could never be so for him.",
"Where were they going?",
"They could not last.",
"But she did want to go!",
"It was life.",
"It never was.",
"He did make me think.",
"It was a part of him.",
"He got up to go.",
"There was little time to do that.",
"What were they going to do?",
"What does that mean?",
"There are a lot of things, but say!",
"Where do the people come from and where are they going?",
"He will come back to me.",
"But that will never be.",
"How had he come here?",
"And I thought of home.",
"Was it only a story?",
"Just got here.",
"Life was life.",
"It did not come.",
"She thought I should.",
"We did not know what was before us.",
"But why look back at all?",
"Still there is a way out.",
"A good thing that.",
"I know not what that may mean.",
"It was my part to find out.",
"I had no other thought.",
"And they did their work.",
"So many!",
"Come on!",
"What can it all mean?",
"And I know her end.",
"It has come at last.",
"It was this way.",
"So long.",
"Go and find it.",
"And he found it.",
"I always do.",
"Or thought that they did.",
"The last time.",
"And did she want it?",
"What did she want?",
"I got there just in time.",
"A might of money!",
"He did not look that way.",
"Did he know that, too?",
"Had he thought of that?",
"What had come over him?",
"He did not know where he was going or why.",
"Way in the back.",
"This was the end.",
"But I know where it might be.",
"Look at him.",
"Now, come over here.",
"At last she was at the end.",
"Back home!",
"There is always another year, and another.",
"How still!",
"She was going now.",
"I like to find her there when I come home.",
"But why do they do it?",
"That is our work.",
"He could not make it out.",
"He had his money.",
"She does not want to do this.",
"It was just their way, she thought.",
"I thought so.",
"Yes, I will.",
"Sure they are.",
"She would do her work well.",
"It had come at last!",
"Would I come?",
"It was something.",
"What was back of it all?",
"Here was a way out.",
"He got it all.",
"But they were not always so.",
"But it was only for a little time.",
"Where is that little being?",
"Where is my own?",
"Yes, it is.",
"Where did he come from?",
"They were made for us.",
"We never thought about it.",
"People want more and more of it.",
"All was still.",
"And now what did this mean?",
"I want to take her home.",
"Now why is this?",
"Under them as well as over them?",
"How long since?",
"What are we going to do with them?",
"Yes, here they are.",
"We could come for it another time.",
"And what are all those things?",
"So it will always be.",
"What is the world to him?",
"What a world!",
"And this is life!",
"That was us.",
"I could never make him out, I know that.",
"But just the same both of them are by me, all right.",
"Things get out.",
"But in a different way each time.",
"Look on me.",
"Why is he not here?",
"All I want to do is to look on.",
"How did they come out?",
"This was too much.",
"What did they mean?",
"With us!",
"Come, now.",
"But why come here?",
"Always did.",
"Just what we thought, too.",
"How would she say it?",
"Now what was she to do next?",
"I had something of a time to get it.",
"He is sure she will get well.",
"But I never do it.",
"It is all made over new.",
"Next time?",
"But she has been so kind to us all.",
"But I want to go.",
"I had not thought of it.",
"And that is what I mean.",
"Could she do a part of it?",
"I mean that.",
"She had not thought of it all day.",
"He was not a part of her life, at all.",
"I just thought of it.",
"He did not know what to say.",
"Why, how can that be?",
"But now it was different.",
"And why first?",
"He put me here.",
"And so with other things.",
"But why have there always been such people?",
"But that would have been little for him.",
"We know very little.",
"For why?",
"Why should they not get on in the world?",
"Now why was this?",
"And we need not know.",
"They know not how, and did not need to know.",
"He was in a new world.",
"Then he come on in.",
"But how to go to work?",
"So I got to do something.",
"I got to!",
"Sure is some story!",
"But work?",
"And he had come back for more, and more.",
"Not in the least.",
"To do with us?",
"But not for long.",
"Her home?",
"Or so they say.",
"I say no more.",
"I have used it.",
"Who next?",
"Look out, look out!",
"He did not want to go home.",
"Just look at him.",
"He was very good, too.",
"But that is very little.",
"Have come to see me!",
"I will go back by it.",
"But what could she say?",
"We will see about that by and by, when I come back.",
"What does he want?",
"Why he?",
"What does he say?",
"Yes, so it is.",
"And may it be?",
"What should I more?",
"I never see him.",
"I know him very well.",
"I like it very well.",
"Why, he was with me too.",
"I think the very same.",
"Yes, I can.",
"Why, so I do.",
"Why, for I will not.",
"Why, this way.",
"That way.",
"I know why that is.",
"What should I look for him?",
"Well, now to look for her.",
"Yes, I do.",
"The very same.",
"Why, will it be?",
"Why, this is well.",
"Too much?",
"What want we now?",
"Come, come, come!",
"But here we have something very different.",
"We may need her.",
"It was just as well, every way, that they did not know.",
"That was very well too.",
"Come right in.",
"The very day I need him most?",
"Well, yes, I should say there was.",
"Mean thing to do.",
"That day has come.",
"What more is there to say?",
"He is not there all day.",
"But it will not last long.",
"Why should I be?",
"A very different thing.",
"He is a long way off from them.",
"What did he mean?",
"It is the right thing to do.",
"I do not even want it then.",
"That is the only way.",
"But she will come.",
"He always has been.",
"It will all come right in the end.",
"It is only money.",
"She can use it.",
"Why should she be now?",
"He was before his time.",
"We got in.",
"There is no home for me here.",
"What can they want here?",
"He is not to know any thing, not to think of any thing.",
"But with all this, it is no home.",
"Why should we get up?",
"We were never much in the world.",
"My home, however, for a time it was to be.",
"Come, then!",
"What a life!",
"And now the day was their own, what should they do next?",
"Both were very good.",
"So I said yes.",
"He did not get very high.",
"Little things do me no good.",
"He was very, very kind.",
"And now the time was come.",
"That was a good thing to know in any world.",
"And would he use them?",
"This would last a long time.",
"How would they take each other?",
"Now the look was different.",
"The time had come when I should probably have to do something.",
"But he was sure of life.",
"Before she might have been in want.",
"They thought that over.",
"Then off they come.",
"What is this something?",
"With us it is so different.",
"But there was no need.",
"Not so, however.",
"For my part.",
"In what way?",
"Look at them!",
"And what do they want?",
"Be sure of it.",
"Never get home, never any more at all.",
"Never to see him!",
"All this has been too much for me.",
"It had come at last.",
"There, I will say no more.",
"Why should he?",
"I say that this is so.",
"But now to the point.",
"There is still a way out.",
"These we have to put up with.",
"And so it may.",
"And why do I do it?",
"It is right that I should do so.",
"To be sure he would.",
"Say something kind to me.",
"There was no way out of it.",
"Well, after all, this was life.",
"I thought of going out.",
"I have some money.",
"So I did the same.",
"Look at me.",
"If there is any more work, I will do it.",
"I want to know just what people think of them.",
"I want more than just that money.",
"It is no use.",
"I want my money.",
"They would be on their way home.",
"Look at her now!",
"They got.",
"I got there.",
"Got it?",
"Got it!",
"Got it down?",
"The point is this.",
"What do I say?",
"So I got up to look around.",
"He was put there.",
"And who is he, I should like to know?",
"He was going to show how to do things.",
"A lot more!",
"I know where I can find out what it is.",
"Now was the time to get some information.",
"But why off?",
"They know something.",
"Now, look here!",
"He was different.",
"That look!",
"So this was the end?",
"Down there?",
"Back of it was another.",
"There was no way out.",
"I do not say that such are of no use in the world.",
"There are a few more such in it.",
"What is my life?",
"They are of the kind which from him we should look for.",
"This is why I come today.",
"I look.",
"This is our first study.",
"I know the world.",
"And I know why.",
"Why could she not?",
"Why, think!",
"I do not know why.",
"Yes, that is what he would do!",
"Why, yes!",
"What could he say to her?",
"But what could he say?",
"Why should I go to them?",
"Do they want me?",
"Yes, I see it is.",
"Why did he not do so?",
"Always money!",
"Just come in?",
"It is not for me to say.",
"And the life!",
"How should I know?",
"Well, why not?",
"And why not, thought he, with me?",
"Yes, she thought of that!",
"I found it, however.",
"They could not find him.",
"Might is there.",
"Yes and no.",
"It was a long way off.",
"Yes, he could.",
"Such was the first day.",
"We have not got to do it.",
"I thought of going home.",
"What did all this mean?",
"Who is against us?",
"Who is with us?",
"He could not say.",
"Did they really see this before them?",
"Is it about to have another?",
"Were they sure of him?",
"Why, I know not.",
"See them, look at them!",
"It is the same thing.",
"This, however, is not all.",
"In this way.",
"Where did they come from?",
"No, never!",
"Too long?",
"Are there so many?",
"I say.",
"See, they come.",
"That way?",
"No, this way.",
"Say on.",
"Why, then by this.",
"Which the next?",
"No point.",
"What way?",
"They come.",
"Of this day?",
"He does something.",
"He had very little money.",
"And when she had said all those things he did what made me like him.",
"The world was good to him.",
"I like it, though.",
"Then there was much work.",
"Why, look!",
"They did not come.",
"How things go.",
"What should they do?",
"This was by day.",
"How could it be real?",
"He never had.",
"I had no need to say more.",
"So it was with the home.",
"There has been too little.",
"Do as I say.",
"This is all so new to me.",
"Was going to.",
"Go for both!",
"How different, though, to what I used to think!",
"I know something.",
"I got at him.",
"Say, I just thought of it.",
"His day was over!",
"The show is over.",
"The more I think of it, the less I like it.",
"But he did very well.",
"That was kind of him!",
"Why should they not?",
"The day is not to them what it was to us.",
"They do so many things!",
"Take time to think.",
"At least, I think so.",
"What was now being said there?",
"It was not to be thought of.",
"Where did she come from?",
"Where should he go?",
"When would they come to take him?",
"And he would probably get it.",
"How could he find out?",
"She was going.",
"But never as now!",
"Why, then, now?",
"It is at an end.",
"Different here.",
"She always would.",
"Different now.",
"I know his kind.",
"And how many?",
"Why did he not do this?",
"I want him.",
"What was there to say?",
"But she had made it.",
"Why did he do that?",
"But it was real.",
"He may never get back.",
"Yes, I had been too kind.",
"But there was no going back now, even if I would.",
"I should have thought less.",
"People would come.",
"It had found something.",
"There was no other thing.",
"And there was no other way to get it.",
"But how long would that be?",
"And I never do.",
"I was sure of that.",
"I had to come.",
"He was there still.",
"It was not to be found.",
"But was he going to her?",
"It was just a thought.",
"It might go against me.",
"It is what we think and what we do that make us what we are.",
"What people need and what they want may be very different.",
"Come in!",
"I know about these things!",
"They were a different people, really.",
"The world is more just.",
"Look on me!",
"That is more to the point.",
"It is something they should not know.",
"What will she do to me next?",
"The more for them, the less for us!",
"Next time.",
"It is now or never!",
"I should come first!",
"Where did each come from?",
"I say, have made it.",
"I do not say that.",
"They might be in the right.",
"Why should it?",
"We know this, I say.",
"Do I say that this is all?",
"How long was it?",
"Got him right over.",
"She did not want to see them now.",
"Who would have thought it of her?",
"I have a home with them.",
"He was off after it.",
"I can too.",
"Well, say!",
"What was she going to do?",
"She had not thought of that.",
"We look it.",
"Why, no.",
"Yes, she was.",
"I was of the number.",
"How did she come there?",
"But, look, look!",
"Never, never!",
"I did mean it.",
"How should she?",
"How did he take that?",
"Could she say this to him?",
"What he say, he do.",
"But, no such thing.",
"Not so with the next, however.",
"I go, he no come.",
"All the same to him.",
"The time was good for what she had to say.",
"It was a good while before it was found out.",
"For this the day was made.",
"What do we mean by this?",
"Look here.",
"Not the least use in all this.",
"I was, too.",
"I should like to know!",
"And this year will not be like last!",
"I did the same.",
"I least of all.",
"I never thought of that!",
"Why not here?",
"All the good I can get from it I have got.",
"Every right.",
"Not in that way.",
"People were kind.",
"What if they were not at home?",
"They were at home.",
"But, here, it is going.",
"When may I see her?",
"How kind he had been!",
"I did take it.",
"And there was no other way.",
"Some say not.",
"Be off.",
"Why had he?",
"Always was.",
"He was long, however.",
"She may be at home any day now.",
"Was I very long?",
"It probably did him the world of good.",
"This is different.",
"So it might!",
"I think I will come in.",
"I never say so.",
"I used to, but people did not like it.",
"But she did not look.",
"But it is our day now.",
"This is to be a big day.",
"But he was always good.",
"It is my home.",
"What did she mean?",
"Was she the same?",
"Time is kind.",
"Things are going well.",
"All put on.",
"And no need for it.",
"If she could only do something.",
"I never see her now.",
"That would never do!",
"What was the use!",
"They are always there.",
"What a figure!",
"Come right in!",
"Could he use it?",
"And no need of it at all.",
"Why was he so still?",
"But it is no use.",
"Over us both.",
"Do I look it?",
"Of a very good figure.",
"What number?",
"And what does that mean?",
"This is the story of it.",
"Now what may that mean?",
"They will be many and long.",
"It was made.",
"Where were they to come from?",
"But this was something different.",
"He could not find them.",
"Who was it who had used them?",
"Why should they know about it?",
"I was too much for him.",
"Get out of the way!",
"Now look out!",
"Now, however, I have found him.",
"Another thought had come to him.",
"There they come now.",
"That would never do.",
"May I have them both?",
"But why should it do this?",
"As it was, there would be little for them to do.",
"Come on, I say!",
"This would never do.",
"But this, this was so different.",
"How did she find it out?",
"He was too much for them.",
"Too much.",
"That is the way.",
"This was a good day.",
"We thought we should see many more.",
"He did come home next day.",
"I have not been very well.",
"What he had to say, however, was not much.",
"There is a way.",
"He has something to do with it.",
"We never thought of that.",
"The time had come.",
"I have no more to say.",
"Yes, that is it.",
"I have put on my things.",
"I thought the world was at an end.",
"It can never be.",
"We, from without, see how the home should be more.",
"But of this be sure.",
"Why were they there?",
"What will he say next?",
"Just look!",
"I never did see!",
"Then another, and another, and another.",
"How long!",
"How many things I know!",
"Why are we here?",
"I did not know where I was for the life of me.",
"A day for her!",
"If I would have it so, to be sure it should be so.",
"I might have had her before now, if I would.",
"She had never been so put to it before.",
"I think it will do very well.",
"So say I.",
"And so I had need.",
"But no money!",
"He is come in.",
"But I say not so to him.",
"This I never did.",
"Yes, she is the very same.",
"I know not why this is.",
"It was a long story.",
"Come up.",
"She is on the way.",
"But they never will.",
"Look for it!",
"Find it!",
"That part is all right.",
"And I got it.",
"I never thought of that before.",
"But there is only another day or so, and we will be back home.",
"Yes, it was right.",
"They are all that way.",
"But how was he to find her?",
"How was he to find her?",
"Down with him!",
"I will be kind.",
"Yes, very well.",
"No life in him?",
"No, no, not any life.",
"Much, I say!",
"Never to look!",
"Of life!",
"I come.",
"Even all I may.",
"I will come down.",
"Money, money, money!",
"No, sure.",
"This way?",
"For money I come, and money will I have.",
"What may we do?",
"I think that some of these should do him good.",
"I would not have him see me for a world.",
"Then say on.",
"Say no more.",
"Is she, sure?",
"And I another.",
"And if I had my will we should.",
"And I do like him very well, too.",
"He was never there.",
"And look!",
"Only this thing first.",
"But this by the way.",
"This was different.",
"As probably he was.",
"She did not look at him.",
"It will all come out right.",
"It was now or never.",
"It might go off.",
"He thought it did.",
"He got it.",
"They are the same thing.",
"Not a thing.",
"He was sure of it.",
"He had had it a long time.",
"Never did.",
"We go to work.",
"I should say so.",
"To be sure.",
"Think back.",
"I mean after!",
"A lot of good.",
"We got time.",
"It will come out all right.",
"He would have to make good.",
"It might be.",
"That was something.",
"These he did not take.",
"It was too much.",
"But why was it there?",
"Only they could not find out what it was.",
"Why should he be?",
"And so they thought they had been.",
"And that is the end of my story.",
"But I should like to have him with me.",
"I could not do this for long.",
"There are too many who will know.",
"That, or something like it.",
"They never do.",
"What is the next thing?",
"And the work is all very good of its kind.",
"But what information could he have?",
"And so I found it.",
"But what was there to say?",
"Yes, there was.",
"Yes, there could.",
"And now the time has come.",
"The time is come!",
"Its use.",
"Why it is so, is another thing.",
"And did they always do it?",
"It was all the same to him.",
"Take me back.",
"Long life to him.",
"Why did he not go on?",
"It was not so, at least, with him.",
"He had not thought of that.",
"Which is all very good.",
"They always are.",
"She found it at last.",
"What will he say to that?",
"I have no use for them.",
"What did he really say?",
"So, however, it was.",
"Where now was her home?",
"I did look out.",
"I got up to go.",
"They say so.",
"His time is his own.",
"This is as it should be.",
"He had made his will the day before.",
"Now look!",
"What if he has got something like this?",
"What was before her?",
"The more need, then, of her.",
"What have they to show for it all?",
"But to our work.",
"That was too much.",
"And why should not these things be?",
"I know it will not always be so.",
"That way no more!",
"Little but these?",
"They come!",
"There it has been since.",
"I know his way.",
"What should he say to her?",
"Now he does not want it.",
"What will she say to him?",
"From that day they would never part.",
"How would she take it?",
"Only a little.",
"An end would come.",
"It will all come right.",
"This was against my will.",
"He was about to make the most of it.",
"What could he say to him?",
"He would not come in.",
"How much I thought on him for it.",
"We used to know him well.",
"I never, never go!",
"And how should he?",
"Well, now, look here.",
"What a long story it had been!",
"They made them.",
"But, I do it in this way.",
"Why is this?",
"Not the least.",
"Go back.",
"Both are good.",
"Show her in.",
"See, here they come.",
"There was too much to say.",
"He was not the same.",
"I should say so!",
"May I see it?",
"I do not think I should do so now.",
"These things have made us what we are.",
"He was still there.",
"We are just where we were before.",
"What would other people say?",
"Never had a day been to her what that day was.",
"Only he is not made that way.",
"But what of such things?",
"But it was not real.",
"That at least is well.",
"And never was there such work.",
"They always did this thing.",
"The very thing!",
"Though he did not say so.",
"Can such things be?",
"Where did I get that lot?",
"I do not make things.",
"What is, has been before.",
"But they did not say it.",
"But there was still more to him.",
"But why should it?",
"They have always been and always will be.",
"Without it I should have put them by.",
"What a day this is!",
"It is always the way with me.",
"I did not mean it.",
"He is come back.",
"But now all is different.",
"So should I.",
"This is why.",
"If that is the new world!",
"For then, what is life?",
"What can I say more?",
"What can I say?",
"I do still think it will be good.",
"Well, then, I mean to.",
"They may come off!",
"I see no more and no less.",
"How should I come through?",
"And so I might.",
"But what are they made of?",
"Why should they not then?",
"Do come.",
"This is not as it should be.",
"How to get back?",
"They do not know what it is to make up a story.",
"If she can, it will be a very good thing for her.",
"And many more.",
"I have found it so.",
"And the always is such a little while now!",
"To come.",
"A year.",
"Much, very.",
"Go to work.",
"To find.",
"To take.",
"All, every.",
"Show it to me.",
"Why, no!",
"Many thought she was, but she was not.",
"How should I?",
"What need they?",
"What would be the use?",
"Why were there so many of them here?",
"This is the very thing, and the first thing, that we do.",
"It is the same with money.",
"There were so many of them every day.",
"But how does this come about?",
"And this is why.",

"We must find a way out of this.",
"What have we to tell him?",
"Let me see.",
"My name?",
"He must go with me.",
"There, my work is done.",
"I may never see her again.",
"How to get away?",
"I must go to him.",
"I must look into that!",
"Tell us all.",
"I know that to be a fact.",
"But here I am.",
"Could it be true?",
"She would tell all.",
"Let us go to him.",
"I must go back at once.",
"He had found the man.",
"But what man did she know?",
"She must see him.",
"It was true.",
"Come at once and take them away.",
"Am I right?",
"Women feel.",
"Of course she is not.",
"Of course not.",
"Of course.",
"So much for the old love.",
"And I did love him so!",
"He was a man.",
"And what is a man?",
"So, let them come.",
"Tell me this, now tell me this.",
"Call down the man of the house.",
"Of course not!",
"And then at last came the call.",
"Maybe some could do it.",
"Let him go.",
"Just what she could not tell.",
"Why not let things go on as they were?",
"Not bad at all.",
"But how different this case would be!",
"Yet really very few left.",
"Think of it, man!",
"So here I am.",
"I am not big.",
"Who am I to love her?",
"I love her?",
"But the little man was different.",
"Why did I feel that?",
"Love me?",
"They went away and came back.",
"Who was left?",
"How should it be done?",
"I have to get away.",
"Yes, they must have him, by this time.",
"He got that away, too.",
"Not yet.",
"Take this case.",
"How was it done?",
"She done it!",
"He went right to the point.",
"At least, that is how I read it.",
"Come, man!",
"He could make me do anything.",
"I will tell all.",
"How would he get away?",
"Who was this man?",
"And yet it must be true!",
"And yet he did.",
"But of course he was right!",
"Would the people think she was good enough?",
"That seems too bad.",
"What is she trying to do?",
"Of course he was not.",
"Then take this thing away.",
"I must give these things back.",
"Man as far as I know.",
"He could not help her.",
"Yes, of course it was possible for her to feel that way.",
"Do I care so much for what people say?",
"Who can tell?",
"He was a good man, and did much for the people.",
"And yet he was a great man.",
"Of course the children came to love him very much.",
"When any of them came to this country, they went to see him.",
"She and her children were in want.",
"Then he went in once more.",
"He did not go to school at all.",
"He was also a very good man.",
"He thought that they would have to give up.",
"They had to give up.",
"Then he let go.",
"Then they went to work to get her off.",
"That is the way he came to know so much about so many things.",
"Then they were to come back again.",
"He was always trying to make things.",
"He was trying to do something with it.",
"That was many years ago.",
"But he did not give up.",
"He was a small man.",
"He had a man to read to him.",
"Then he thought he would never get home again.",
"He went home to see him.",
"Then she would go on again.",
"Then he might find some way of getting home again.",
"He went away.",
"Then he came down.",
"But it came true.",
"From that time he did not once look around.",
"She went to school again.",
"It was a very good school.",
"The other children got work to do that made money.",
"Are there enough of them?",
"Again, let us see.",
"But this is not enough.",
"But I let him know that he should not have them say what he would.",
"He went.",
"She went off.",
"He had seen enough.",
"Yet there was something to be said.",
"This, however, was not important.",
"How many people would care?",
"True work for a man.",
"She did not know that could not be again.",
"She came to it now.",
"I am to go back, then?",
"She came to him.",
"Never again.",
"Come to the house.",
"Another came up.",
"Time went on.",
"He went on.",
"What a change came over her!",
"I went up.",
"They came.",
"I could not tell where I had known it in life.",
"But I want it now, and must use it.",
"Why, I could never tell.",
"How do they feel?",
"I would feel more at home there.",
"He called again.",
"We must find out what they are up to.",
"Our part in the work has been done.",
"But the second came on.",
"I thought I was done for.",
"There may have been a man with her.",
"And how would he get into the house?",
"She went last week.",
"He was not so bad.",
"The man did so.",
"She must never know, the world must never know that I had seen her here.",
"Yet why?",
"I did not know her well enough to tell.",
"Went how?",
"It would help.",
"So there we are again!",
"To business, then.",
"I must go.",
"And the women!",
"He could not help it.",
"When would he come again?",
"Tell me at once.",
"It was just possible.",
"Was it under my control?",
"I went back to see.",
"I did what she would never have let me do if she had known.",
"Something must be said at once.",
"He must say no, and he did.",
"How can I tell?",
"Tell me the whole story.",
"I must go to him!",
"Where could that book be?",
"Next week we may look for it.",
"But never let him look at me.",
"A few days would show.",
"What is left?",
"She did love him.",
"Then he came on.",
"A man came out.",
"It is the first time I ever see it.",
"But he did not let go.",
"They did not go far.",
"And then the change came.",
"Then he went on.",
"And all the love I give to each to give me back again.",
"We must go back home.",
"The next day they set out again.",
"Tell me where.",
"They went away.",
"They went out.",
"The next day they set out.",
"He went back home.",
"They had given him no time to think.",
"Whether life be a real good?",
"What can she give now?",
"What could he be doing?",
"How they change!",
"Really, this is too bad!",
"He must see about it.",
"It is a great thing to read well.",
"He set about the thing at once.",
"It is just what I should have done if I were a man.",
"These were my children.",
"Who could have done it?",
"But only for a second.",
"We are getting off.",
"But I too must away.",
"The thing had to be done.",
"Take it away, I say.",
"This must not be.",
"What is her name?",
"Enough of that.",
"But it seems that there is not.",
"And this is important.",
"Let us do so!",
"That would be going too far.",
"There are several of them.",
"I have just left them.",
"What should we have done without them?",
"How is it done?",
"Our people show the place.",
"It was hard.",
"I went out.",
"I am going.",
"It is true, but not new.",
"What have those years left to me?",
"How could they help him?",
"Yet what can I do?",
"A man!",
"But even of that I am not at all sure.",
"He is not here yet.",
"We are going up next week.",
"We must go.",
"Away in the country.",
"What man has not?",
"The days went on.",
"He was a kind man.",
"They left me, yes, they left me.",
"What am I to do?",
"What am I to do with him?",
"But next day I was all right again.",
"What a country!",
"The end was almost come.",
"Tell them they may go.",
"But that was a while ago.",
"I have never been a good example.",
"Very bad here.",
"Take him away.",
"And she had seen it all.",
"I have seen the world.",
"It was true then.",
"Do not take it so hard, man!",
"I have often thought that she would like it so.",
"They must not see.",
"What was she doing here?",
"That is why I came out.",
"Now I really must go.",
"But something must be done.",
"And I am.",
"We can see without being seen.",
"Once in a way.",
"I must have help.",
"That man must be found.",
"Get it at once.",
"He must go and see.",
"Let her take my all.",
"So the work went on.",
"It must be so.",
"Let us think.",
"Let a man only find out that.",
"For what has come true for him may come true for any man.",
"Why should we care for it, even if it be true?",
"Rather, I say, it should be so.",
"Yes, that is true.",
"Not that which is bad in him?",
"So far so good.",
"I think it must be so.",
"Must it not be so?",
"Not so in fact.",
"But why should it be true?",
"That is often too true.",
"Is it not true?",
"I am down, and down I must be.",
"Why then love man?",
"And yet it was not so.",
"Let them go.",
"Do such people get most work done?",
"Far, far from it.",
"But what has that, again, to do with us?",
"This is but a guess on my part.",
"I say he must.",
"And yet so it is.",
"It is enough.",
"He did all that a man could do.",
"The story of that day is well known.",
"As a fact she did not.",
"So it seems to me.",
"Why should I keep him time?",
"When a thing has to be done, do it.",
"Did she ever think of it?",
"I have done so.",
"Come in at once.",
"I have seen her.",
"This, though, is not my case.",
"I have never seen it.",
"What am I to do with such people?",
"How hard!",
"He has done pretty well as yet.",
"In any other way, he was mean enough.",
"Why any week?",
"He must be a very old man.",
"Still, I do get a little, and I like to have the children about me.",
"How is that to be done?",
"That is by the week.",
"It was hard to make her look right.",
"I never actually went to school, so some things I do not know.",
"This makes me feel bad, too.",
"I am big!",
"I know this is true.",
"I love my family.",
"Then I could tell her what was going on.",
"And so it went for the next day and the next.",
"No, he would have to have help.",
"It was such a little thing for me to give.",
"However, if we do not, our children will.",
"The whole story is not so well known.",
"What a change!",
"She was never at school.",
"It was a very different house.",
"But the end was not to come at once.",
"Love me!",
"Can this be true?",
"But who should tell him so?",
"Are they true?",
"I know this country.",
"And now it is all done.",
"What have I done?",
"Now, we were doing some good.",
"She was of that school.",
"She did not of course see it.",
"Every day and all day we call many things love which are not love.",
"And people said things of him that were not true.",
"Such women always know the time.",
"Did she love him?",
"Her expression did not change.",
"He had done all he could.",
"I always am.",
"The thing has to be done.",
"So I give in.",
"There is so much to be done.",
"Then she came back.",
"I know the man.",
"He could not tell him more.",
"For years we have been doing what we can.",
"Let him work.",
"She did not want her to go away just yet.",
"I have seen.",
"Many women are.",
"But I must see the place.",
"We are all part of what we have seen.",
"What had they seen?",
"He will not do it yet.",
"It is a pretty story.",
"I tell them again now.",
"If so, I am here.",
"It is not as bad as that.",
"It was years ago.",
"It was only now that I could get away.",
"I am sure she did that.",
"Her name?",
"Must we say more?",
"But have a care!",
"Set on!",
"Still, it is true.",
"Is it the place?",
"Until this last week I never thought much about it.",
"That, however, has no place in this story.",
"But he could get help now.",
"Look at me, for example.",
"Things go well enough when business is good.",
"But in the country?",
"They had to love the work, and do it for love of it.",
"Where he got that name is not known, but he had no other.",
"It was part of the whole problem.",
"And it is true.",
"Business would have to come first.",
"They help.",
"Never a day without new patients.",
"There it was again.",
"But they are doing the same old thing in the same old way.",
"But I might have known.",
"Yes, they were old again!",
"Why, of course he had.",
"But the women did not like it at all.",
"I do work, and I must work.",
"What was to be done?",
"This system will not do.",
"It will keep a long time.",
"What was her name?",
"So he went his way to his patients.",
"Then I went on.",
"That was so pretty!",
"But this is the man all over.",
"How that work was done we have just seen.",
"I was to help them.",
"The family name is thought to have been different at that time.",
"It was not true, however.",
"All the children love her very much.",
"If only he had done it!",
"I want them to know who I am, of course.",
"Not yet?",
"It seems to me as if old times had come back again.",
"It is not true at all.",
"And every other place is the same.",
"It is their business to see as much as possible.",
"Then the work is done.",
"Am I not by?",
"I care not how old they are.",
"I think every thing should be known.",
"Now let us look at the fact.",
"She went on.",
"If it was to be ever, now for it!",
"It was the old story.",
"Then I left him.",
"There was need for so doing.",
"We know that there is no good in a man who is doing what he does not will to do.",
"Tell me that.",
"What would this man?",
"How little known!",
"Then what is man?",
"Still, ever.",
"By what help?",
"Or a second.",
"No, he would not give her up!",
"She had a real good man by what she said.",
"He read them over and over again.",
"There was something to be done now.",
"This, however, was not the case.",
"But enough of this.",
"I did not know or feel where I was or what I had next to do.",
"Off again.",
"It sure is hard.",
"Read that.",
"We love our own country.",
"But she as yet had found out but little about him.",
"I seen it again.",
"Yes, the old man is here.",
"It came again.",
"His name!",
"Yet he would not have had it any different.",
"Then I seen.",
"Then no more came.",
"I went all over, and almost all of them came.",
"It was great.",
"It was good that they did call.",
"The government man said so.",
"She would never love another man.",
"She would do anything.",
"Let them have him.",
"This man was not old.",
"She must work for that.",
"It was love.",
"What do we care?",
"She had let him go!",
"I went over to see him.",
"Yet some things I must tell.",
"My time is almost up.",
"Love to all.",
"Give my love to all.",
"We let him go.",
"They did not want to let me see him.",
"I feel that.",
"What I think of, what I am going after, what I need seems far, far away.",
"The fact that they were there was enough.",
"Not so far!",
"He must be seen.",
"They had not, however, made sure of this fact.",
"That would be great.",
"They went into the house.",
"What a man!",
"They never have done so.",
"Look at the children.",
"This has since been done.",
"Seems to be all right.",
"It is not true.",
"Yet this time could not have been great.",
"I must see.",
"All that can be done, has been.",
"What is the man?",
"They will be enough.",
"That he has got away?",
"Love would never do this thing.",
"Then they went out.",
"But time was to tell.",
"Well, we went.",
"Yet he had been there a long time.",
"His first call was for water.",
"She did not know any other man who would have said that in just that way.",
"Where he came from, of course.",
"Why had he done that?",
"I am going to find him.",
"Go away.",
"Now or ever.",
"I have business with him.",
"No, of course not.",
"But that was so long ago.",
"Yet he was going up them!",
"I am going to look around now.",
"He must have thought of that.",
"But he had not seen.",
"She called again.",
"Got anything to say?",
"I am not like that!",
"It was so hard to think at all!",
"He came on.",
"So it seems.",
"But how is this possible?",
"Change it?",
"It will be seen that it is not always possible.",
"How may this be done?",
"There again!",
"He seems without a will.",
"They were doing very well.",
"It could not be done.",
"Still, there was something left for him to do.",
"It does not look hard to me.",
"There must be more than that to the story, she thought.",
"But money is of no use in this case.",
"I guess so.",
"Maybe it was not true.",
"He must see it.",
"I thought when I came he could go here.",
"Let him have both.",
"He has done so.",
"But such was not the case.",
"But tell it to me again!",
"But this was far from being the case.",
"But they could not last for ever.",
"It was then true!",
"Is it possible?",
"Off we went.",
"He made me get it for him several times.",
"If he had been kind to me, I would have done anything for him.",
"She had a great many things to do.",
"Just then there was a change.",
"Then it went away again.",
"We were both pretty well used up.",
"Then they found what a state we were in.",
"Now I must go.",
"Then she went away.",
"Then he went away too.",
"Now that could be done in the country.",
"Of course, I did not let him do much work.",
"If they do a thing once, they will do it again.",
"However, from that day there was a change in him.",
"Years went by.",
"He left a will.",
"I am here to see it done.",
"It had to be done.",
"And so she went on.",
"Let us look for another.",
"And what do they tell us?",
"And yet we have not done.",
"There is another world to tell of yet.",
"But this we can tell.",
"Let us look for them.",
"Who can tell now?",
"I have seen such many a time.",
"We know no more as yet.",
"But they must be kind enough to let me tell my story my own way.",
"But the fact is not so.",
"But in what state?",
"This was found to be the case.",
"Let us now see how.",
"Tell me all about them.",
"If I had only known!",
"No man.",
"Is that true?",
"It can be read either way.",
"Another man!",
"I again went on.",
"Take away my good name, take away my life.",
"We need not go far to find it.",
"Enough of this!",
"Is not that enough?",
"Well, let it take them!",
"I often do that.",
"Know where the water went?",
"I guess not.",
"I read about that in a book.",
"And what am I doing?",
"Why I would not but have seen it for ever so much.",
"How came I here?",
"I must not think of that.",
"Study call!",
"It was all my doing.",
"Did they love her, after all?",
"This is a fact.",
"Same old story.",
"We must have a look in on him.",
"She came.",
"We might have known.",
"The day they set.",
"Not a bad name.",
"Bad man.",
"I work and work, to keep it down.",
"He must find his own way.",
"She must go with those.",
"Far out as possible, though.",
"We must guess at it.",
"He would not call out.",
"I always do go away off!",
"But I did not want anything if I might have him.",
"Almost as old as I was when I first came.",
"Her life has done him good.",
"But I do not want to take her place.",
"And he was going far away, too.",
"Am I so big?",
"The house is a large house.",
"I am going up to look at them.",
"She would rather go home and never go to school any more than to do that.",
"Was there ever so much to tell before?",
"He went away, and she was not kind to him.",
"And a house of his own.",
"What must he think of me!",
"But he seems all right.",
"I went.",
"I am sure of it.",
"Too bad!",
"It must go to school.",
"But again.",
"We need not go far for them.",
"Would that ever come true?",
"Let us look at it in this way for once.",
"As it was then, so may it be again.",
"But he was not yet done.",
"Day came.",
"They would be getting up now.",
"Most women did.",
"That was a little thing, of course.",
"It would make him think that I was a man.",
"But then he went on.",
"Not a man in the world.",
"Big enough.",
"Given away is what I said and given away is what I mean.",
"I never seen anything like it!",
"But I got right up and came back to him.",
"I have some at the house.",
"But of course there was no other way.",
"That, in fact, was what he was doing.",
"This was his course.",
"And I say it again.",
"And what was the fact?",
"Then it must have been another.",
"I really must go.",
"So far, good.",
"She went on down.",
"But what was to be done could not be done in any other way.",
"Not love her!",
"They all went into the house.",
"No more children!",
"Let us be off!",
"To love!",
"Was it possible?",
"What can he be doing?",
"This was true.",
"This was a fact.",
"There was no need for him to say anything more.",
"What is he doing?",
"And then came the end.",
"What again is this?",
"What is the name?",
"The world has done so much for him, what can he do for the world?",
"To take his life who is my love from me?",
"As I am?",
"So, set them down.",
"In his right place.",
"If I can help it.",
"Go to, I am.",
"Go, call him in.",
"In a well, man!",
"Give it me.",
"Enough, I will.",
"How, man?",
"Must I?",
"Come, go with me to help me look him out.",
"No more I am not.",
"What can I tell, where I am?",
"Guess here.",
"Who be they, man?",
"Where am I now?",
"Let go, I say.",
"Why, how now, women?",
"My man!",
"I care not, if I do.",
"What can a man have more?",
"I came?",
"I call?",
"Then get away.",
"But how he will get it again, I know not.",
"Now, man!",
"He called to her at once.",
"Could he still love her after that?",
"She is not far away.",
"How could she help it?",
"On the whole, I think he would.",
"Course I will.",
"So am I.",
"The results of it came out now.",
"Course he did!",
"Of course!",
"Guess I know the place.",
"There must be something about it.",
"It is not what they have done in life.",
"It is important.",
"I know most of the people in this house.",
"If he had anything to say, he said it.",
"It may not be as bad as that.",
"I am very hard up.",
"Of course I had never seen him.",
"At least, I think I am.",
"It seems to be the only thing to do.",
"But it seems hard on other people.",
"And I am to be just the same as I am now.",
"Of course it is all very well for me.",
"Many can guess, but few guess right.",
"I have left school.",
"I am not.",
"It would do her good for ever after.",
"Let them look to that.",
"Such a state of things could not last.",
"It will not do to read them out.",
"All days are the same.",
"I have done all that I came into this world to do.",
"So far all is well.",
"By this time it must be all over with him.",
"What a name!",
"Probably not the real name.",
"I read on.",
"What was I to read next?",
"I found it with no problem at all.",
"This should be left for a few days.",
"Life must be seen, before it can be known.",
"I want money very bad.",
"It was at an early part of my life.",
"I was very bad.",
"She has left me.",
"He would have no more of it ever.",
"Well, I must be going now.",
"Yet, so it was.",
"Good, again!",
"Do it hard!",
"But something has got to be done.",
"But who done it?",
"But he had company.",
"Let me out!",
"I might have known it was he.",
"How could I help it?",
"Have I any right to it yet?",
"I want to help.",
"Now this is just the case here.",
"The more I see of this place the more I like it.",
"This is true.",
"Why should he, sure enough?",
"And, after all, what is this love?",
"What more could be done for them?",
"I put it as a problem.",
"Anything but that.",
"But if they need, they must go.",
"So it must be.",
"Of course she was.",
"And the old name, too!",
"But to give up him!",
"We love each other!",
"It was too true.",
"What right have we to keep them down?",
"And he will not let me!",
"He would go and tell him so.",
"And yet, no.",
"Is he, too, to give up all?",
"Let him go on.",
"But I have seen the world.",
"Was that not the least it could have done?",
"Let us get the case in this way.",
"But enough of that.",
"But I must get on with my story.",
"May he help us!",
"I feel to love him much.",
"What name should he give her?",
"The whole thing is out.",
"Of course he would.",
"He would show him how it was done.",
"Now who could have done that?",
"Could this be true?",
"I am on my way to new things.",
"There was a change.",
"To me it is rather important.",
"I must go and see her.",
"I am so far away.",
"It was such a human little problem.",
"He went away again and has just come back.",
"And then she came.",
"I feel it, and I am always right in these things.",
"Be a man.",
"He must.",
"There never were such children in the world.",
"Think again!",
"I must think about it.",
"Help us?",
"So I went.",
"The children came.",
"Times was too hard.",
"Our money of course.",
"In my business I have to be all right.",
"Would she guess?",
"Let me have it.",
"But I must put them.",
"Must be.",
"Yes, I am sure I could do that, with a little thought.",
"He should have done that at first.",
"Why, the whole thing!",
"And I went home.",
"Even yet she had not called for help.",
"Maybe that was it.",
"This is not so bad, but it is enough.",
"What state?",
"Could he not take away as well as give?",
"I give only a part of it.",
"Yet more!",
"How great?",
"Am I the first that go this way?",
"With this they left us.",
"He was made real man again.",
"They are true.",
"However, it came at last.",
"And am I not right?",
"For the first time he was in love.",
"Come here, little man!",
"Did she feel it?",
"He has given so much.",
"However, let that go!",
"Is what he says true?",
"But tell me!",
"But I must!",
"I must!",
"I want to know what she is doing.",
"And all this was done.",
"How far might I have been on my way by this time!",
"Yes, time and change come to all.",
"May he never feel the like!",
"We had no children then.",
"Each had his man.",
"And I left them.",
"Who am I?",
"But what is to be done?",
"They did not get far.",
"They let him go.",
"Then they went away.",
"We have just seen.",
"There were a large number of them.",
"What would they have done with the people?",
"And what would the people have done with them?",
"Let us be just, however.",
"We went there.",
"This was the place.",
"I went up to him.",
"I have never seen him since.",
"We went in.",
"And I called out my name to him.",
"They set off.",
"It is done.",
"I had not as yet thought of this.",
"Come back to the country!",
"This man will do all.",
"I went there.",
"But what was to be done?",
"We called him in.",
"I went out to her.",
"I have not seen him since.",
"He had seen him at my house.",
"Let us give it.",
"And I left him.",
"We must go home.",
"Yet he went there.",
"We got into the first we came to.",
"The man was right.",
"They set out on their way.",
"What public did they call in?",
"Here is an example.",
"They set out.",
"They did not feel it.",
"It was too early.",
"To love it.",
"Case I.",
"I am sure he would.",
"He had also read much and thought much.",
"Care for her, for I will go.",
"They did not look back once.",
"But for me, he had never done what he has done.",
"Where are they yet?",
"When went she?",
"Which way went she?",
"Most true.",
"Too true.",
"A man.",
"What must now be done?",
"I must not.",
"Not seen him?",
"What has he done?",
"I must have it.",
"Let me come in!",
"Let me come in, let me come in!",
"I care not.",
"Great and small!",
"I have no part in either.",
"How can this be done?",
"But he was a man, and he went to work.",
"It was the old, old story.",
"But there was work to be done.",
"They were as they were made and must be.",
"It is good for a man to have had bad times.",
"They are doing very well now.",
"She must care for him now.",
"But now he was in love.",
"Here came in the man.",
"But I will have it yet!",
"It is often that way with women.",
"Help me.",
"His own case was not so bad.",
"We must use that.",
"Look again.",
"He must find his love.",
"It came then.",
"It was enough.",
"It came about in this way.",
"He must get even.",
"All went well.",
"He had seen them.",
"Yet he had seen the new!",
"And the old man could not tell.",
"He did not see that either.",
"The case was at an end.",
"Take another case.",
"He came again with another.",
"It was so in this case.",
"I was not after much money, but I must have more.",
"We would change this and that.",
"An example must be made!",
"He had a hard problem to figure out.",
"Let him up.",
"Too bad, though!",
"Yes, she is there, and a man with her.",
"Let me make it right.",
"Guess not!",
"I must get to my family.",
"He read it over and over.",
"He said to the man there was something to think over.",
"Anything but that!",
"It was true then!",
"But there is really very little to tell.",
"This is just the place for him right now!",
"I did not tell him what they were.",
"But were there ever days when this was not the case?",
"I could not tell him.",
"This, too, is not now the case.",
"It is because we love the children that they do for us so great a good thing.",
"All of us know that it is true.",
"What had he done?",
"So far he had not seen her since that first day.",
"What had to be must be.",
"This is her country.",
"Let them take him now!",
"Maybe not.",
"Now, as well as ever!",
"He had done what he had set out to do.",
"Well, let it.",
"Yet even this was not all.",
"Much less at other times.",
"That was true.",
"Let it go at that.",
"Not once did she look back.",
"It was an old story.",
"Am I?",
"Some of them had been put out of business.",
"Why had he done it?",
"She did not need to guess that.",
"They get the man they go after.",
"At once.",
"Anything rather than that, she thought.",
"Got to keep going.",
"But this was just what they must have done.",
"If she was going, it must be at once.",
"He called to her.",
"And how was it possible that they would not find him?",
"She could not read it.",
"Well see what she can tell us.",
"Who could tell?",
"It was a long, hard business.",
"But not as bad as it did, does it?",
"What was to be done then?",
"This man was bad.",
"Maybe for a day or more.",
"Very pretty.",
"But of course he probably did not care what she thought.",
"Such was not the case.",
"Is it large or small?",
"It must be there still.",
"We may help each other, so.",
"My life would have been a small thing to give.",
"Now, the thing was to get him away.",
"I had time enough.",
"But what he would do, what I think he has done, is this.",
"That is enough to say.",
"Not that there were a great many of them.",
"But I had never used it yet.",
"I had never seen him like that before.",
"But it did not come out again.",
"But they had not given him time.",
"Could he, would he help me to do that?",
"And I, of all people in the world, was to help him, with her.",
"So he left me.",
"Here was a man!",
"There was never a man like him.",
"He is a man.",
"He came then.",
"It is all for man and it is all done by man.",
"Other people work for us, and we must work for them.",
"It is pretty much the same in business.",
"The house is not the same place without her.",
"Love is always good!",
"That is, when they can get away with it.",
"Is there anything I can do to help?",
"Can it be true?",
"But small children are not!",
"Let us get back to our story.",
"Maybe this and maybe that.",
"They are in second place.",
"So I left and went home.",
"What a great man he was!",
"But no man can do this again.",
"Should he change the name?",
"Name him!",
"Do I love her?",
"He was not like a human being.",
"I am no more use.",
"Who had done it?",
"Such is the fact.",
"She came to life again.",
"There is a second world.",
"Let us have it.",
"Some day next week.",
"Of course that was the way it had been.",
"He had found the house all right?",
"See that water.",
"They had now come that far.",
"It was not enough.",
"Why, not once.",
"Then he came back.",
"So of course I came home.",
"And yet he was doing much.",
"Yet how could I help it?",
"So at first I was not sure of my man.",
"But she could not read much.",
"They are almost there!",
"She had not to look far.",
"No name on it, either.",
"Such, however, was far from being the case.",
"This we have not yet done.",
"The fact was so.",
"This was enough.",
"It will be done.",
"Let them have their day.",
"He came and went.",
"I guess we can.",
"But what must she think of us?",
"I am going home!",
"I have called her by name.",
"I could only guess.",
"Never do that again.",
"What must the end be?",
"We call it new.",
"I feel like that, too.",
"She had always known this.",
"Yet there it was.",
"I might have known.",
"I love her.",
"There must be a way.",
"Business is business.",
"They might not need it all, but then again they might.",
"They were not in love, of course.",
"Look at me hard!",
"And he had seen.",
"I know I am.",
"And that is what I must find out.",
"Just as if anything ever could!",
"Of course I had to have some money.",
"Far from it!",
"All the love is there yet.",
"I can feel things in people, too.",
"But there is time yet.",
"Who says I am different?",
"But I did not think she would go that far.",
"She did not love him.",
"Just like a book.",
"Yet it was he!",
"But then she did not need to say anything.",
"But it was hard work.",
"He must get home at once.",
"I should have made sure long ago.",
"But of course he could not guess.",
"I feel that I can never work hard enough.",
"She was not pretty, at least not very pretty.",
"Only this once!",
"She would do anything at all, if she could only find the thing to do.",
"It had been a trying day.",
"I am only going to use a little.",
"It would be hard to say.",
"And she did help.",
"Could I have done more?",
"And that is what I have been doing.",
"Much less a human being.",
"The fact is every day seems just like every other day.",
"Yet such was the case, and there they all were!",
"Had she said enough?",
"She must say something or go.",
"I see it, old man.",
"I must.",
"The house was very still.",
"Let me.",
"And now it has come true.",
"And as he never did tell, how can I know?",
"The second came first.",
"How does that help?",
"The whole lot!",
"Then we can do business.",
"We must find her.",
"Now, then, let me come in.",
"Had he ever seen her since?",
"Of course I said she might.",
"What good have they done?",
"The fact is, he did some business for me.",
"I want to know what his business is.",
"And so, of course, we want to know if he really was what he said he was, over there.",
"That is the really important thing.",
"That he must do.",
"Then he came out.",
"Did he ever get it?",
"So I set out.",
"Then I went on to tell him more.",
"A world state?",
"What then does she give up?",
"I have done what I could.",
"But what could she be doing there?",
"Just as well that I should see it done.",
"He was done.",
"There have been several.",
"If it was good enough for them it was good enough for him.",
"Then a thought came to him.",
"The man had been so kind to him in life, so very kind.",
"There could not have been so great a change.",
"I have not seen him.",
"But let us get on with the case.",
"Give us time.",
"If he should tell him, that would end it all.",
"What was the first thing to be done?",
"Now, let us see.",
"He had thought never to do this again.",
"He did not think, at first, that he ever could like it.",
"That was a great help.",
"But if he was going he must be about it.",
"And he did get away from them.",
"But there was a way for him to make it known.",
"It was not hard work that he was doing.",
"Human life is not yet so well known, as that we can have it.",
"Water is the same every where.",
"He had given only a part of his system.",
"Yet here we were actually among them.",
"I had not seen such a place for a long time.",
"What is it then that I am doing?",
"I read it to him.",
"This is all that can be done.",
"I did not read.",
"The house is large.",
"But not often.",
"A new man.",
"I have never, in fact, seen any of them but once before.",
"I know it can be done.",
"Not often though.",
"It was not her house, after all.",
"Each cell has a life of its own.",
"This should not be done.",
"Who would take care of it?",
"But what did she care what was said of her?",
"This a house I do not know?",
"Is it true?",
"It was true!",
"Let us go there now.",
"Let us go on.",
"And I guess I did.",
"He had been home, but had left again.",
"They had several children.",
"It is put up with as long as possible.",
"No children in the house!",
"Well, I guess not.",
"He seems all right just now.",
"So far was well enough.",
"Are we not children of this world?",
"I must, I must come at them.",
"Give him the day.",
"And he let me go.",
"It is now seen!",
"I have been and am bad enough.",
"Very true!",
"They should call me to him.",
"It is a care they are used to.",
"I did not see him as I went down.",
"But I will not, if I can help it.",
"Then does she not love them too much, me too little?",
"But of this more in its place.",
"But she got over it at once.",
"But that was pretty.",
"She did not come back for days and days and days.",
"We must go with him!",
"Not to be seen is bad enough.",
"They were up in a second.",
"But he must go now.",
"I love them, too.",
"They would never have done that.",
"I am here!",
"But they were not enough.",
"Is it not so, my children?",
"And it was done.",
"For school was out.",
"But this was some years ago.",
"She just could not help it.",
"Go back home at once!",
"Now they were going away.",
"They must have money.",
"I must know more of this.",
"These things must be done.",
"But she went on.",
"They have been known to do it through love.",
"We are all right so far.",
"Out of my house!",
"Of that enough.",
"Help, help, help!",
"With love?",
"Why did she change her name?",
"Or any other pretty things?",
"Away from me!",
"Why, here I am.",
"Enough, enough!",
"Away, away!",
"Well, let that be.",
"That must not be.",
"For money, man?",
"I am, where I like.",
"How so, man?",
"Set it to.",
"Where, man?",
"If I love!",
"My love!",
"I must have her, because she will have me!",
"My house!",
"Why, how now, man!",
"Come, let us to it then.",
"Why, how now, man?",
"She could not even guess who had called her.",
"But this is not important.",
"Anything more?",
"It was enough, however.",
"The end was not yet.",
"He had never done such a thing.",
"And I have not done yet.",
"I feel it.",
"Take them, and tell him.",
"She was with him again next day.",
"I am like them.",
"And women?",
"If I am the first to find it out!",
"I love him!",
"Another man?",
"He had to go home at once, he said.",
"Why had he not known of this in time?",
"No more hard work for us.",
"It was a hard world.",
"And company!",
"I almost had it.",
"I never want to see him again.",
"Maybe I can find out something, see.",
"And a few days is all I need to find out what I want to.",
"How big was he again?",
"And done too many.",
"Not a care, not a care.",
"Then I came away.",
"The other man went away.",
"Bad business.",
"He did not feel like it.",
"They went.",
"They all seen him.",
"There was no help for it.",
"He got up and went out.",
"She must like him a lot.",
"He let him go.",
"He went out the back way.",
"And yet, after all, there is no need for that.",
"He must go and look at him.",
"What has been once can never come over again.",
"And then there came a change over him.",
"He had seen them often.",
"And what story did she tell them?",
"And I am the last of my family.",
"Let them go on.",
"Now I must go on.",
"This is even more important!",
"Children always are right.",
"It is just the same with my business.",
"That was all in the way of business.",
"But not yet.",
"How did I guess?",
"There is little more to tell.",
"But once was enough.",
"I am almost sure of that.",
"We have done work of the most good.",
"He would love to go too.",
"Is a man little?",
"Let us take the first case.",
"But come in and see us again.",
"But they have found several more.",
"It has been done.",
"Now, has he done this?",
"And it is not even true.",
"Can it not be made possible?",
"Let me go now.",
"There had not been time enough.",
"No other course was possible.",
"And that is a great thing.",
"And this seems to have always been the case.",
"This is not bad.",
"Well done!",
"How this has often been done.",
"But is this the fact?",
"Of course he did.",
"I am not the man I was.",
"Let him in!",
"To business.",
"Why, of course.",
"But his work was not yet done.",
"In the next place.",
"For example.",
"This was done at the same time, by the same man!",
"Well, let it go how it will!",
"And in another place.",
"How came it there?",
"But I must say something.",
"So let it be.",
"For what have we not seen within the last few years?",
"Now see what I am.",
"I guess so too!",
"I am a man.",
"He was a man of the world.",
"Go, little book!",
"It will all come out right yet.",
"I have long seen it.",
"We went.",
"But such was not the state of the case.",
"No women came at all.",
"She called his name again.",
"What a lot of them there must be!",
"Time must show.",
"And enough too!",
"Come at once.",
"Can a man want more?",
"It is not right, but it is very human.",
"I have not seen her since we were at school.",
"What did he care?",
"Much company to see the new house.",
"Why do the people come in a week and go in a day?",
"Such was the state of things.",
"I am out of love with it.",
"This is true for the time being.",
"For is it not a great day?",
"I would do it again.",
"Her love was her own to give.",
"He must come back.",
"He seems about to take her for life.",
"Does he love her?",
"I have no house, no home.",
"Give it to me.",
"They will not tell me what I want to know.",
"Would they say he was in love with her?",
"It is always done.",
"He is not the man to do it.",
"He has done all he can.",
"Yet there had been a way.",
"Go at once.",
"He would not let her go.",
"He must be here.",
"Must be done!",
"Who is the man?",
"He did not see how he could help it.",
"Yet so it is.",
"This was hard from her.",
"In a week.",
"She could not tell.",
"How all this had come about he could not even guess.",
"She had done all she could.",
"Should she love him less for that?",
"What has she done?",
"What could she do to keep him?",
"She has once more found her home.",
"Why every house has it.",
"They done well.",
"What should I care for them?",
"Let us get on.",
"It was very hard!",
"But she went on to tell them what it was like as well as she could.",
"And I do know a great many things that are good and bad for us.",
"But I must go on with the story.",
"Of course that was it!",
"Old women were not at all in his way.",
"Let us find them something to do.",
"And his name?",
"This was also seen by each of us at the same time.",
"But let it be so.",
"Her care was not for that.",
"I had its great example every day before me.",
"After this he left me.",
"It was not at all too large.",
"Who does not feel it?",
"Either it is good or not good.",
"Who ever is or can be?",
"That system has had time enough.",
"A school.",
"They are just high enough without being too high.",
"Now I find what love can do.",
"Here I am, I.",
"But, I love him.",
"Love him!",
"We must part.",
"Must I then go?",
"So much then for the love of show.",
"They are the children.",
"The house, however, was there, most of it.",
"I should say he did, rather.",
"I could only be sure that at least it was not love.",
"This is not a love story.",
"But what came after?",
"So I am.",
"Is it that we do not care?",
"I thought so once, but not now.",
"How had it been done?",
"He would have given anything if he could have called him in, but he could not.",
"He was well known.",
"Give it me back again.",
"However, what I have said is true.",
"I tell them so.",
"But I had done it!",
"I am so made.",
"No change.",
"I think it can be done.",
"What he has done, I can do.",
"We went over it several times.",
"We could not take it all in at once.",
"It was too good to be true.",
"Here is a case in point.",
"In each case.",
"For here was the problem.",
"And so it went.",
"The only way to get out of my way is to keep on going.",
"There was little to be seen.",
"This was a week ago.",
"And away we went.",
"This is the way it is done.",
"And yet, not yet.",
"Then a new thought came to me.",
"Something had to be done.",
"Sure enough, it did.",
"What name?",
"The thought of them makes me feel good.",
"And then it came.",
"And it came.",
"I did not tell her so.",
"And then came the day.",
"So back I came.",
"Who she was is not known.",
"I am not he.",
"Away with him!",
"Do not go from house to house.",
"And they came to him.",
"So they left him and went away.",
"It is enough!",
"It was their business in life.",
"It was business.",
"He got away from me over and over again, but I never let him know.",
"Why does not any man do this that I do?",
"Me he did not tell.",
"How did I feel and think?",
"So why should we tell him anything?",
"I will give all.",
"It was the place.",
"I have no children.",
"Where are her children?",
"What has been, will be again.",
"And she did not keep away from him.",
"There was such another case not long ago.",
"Look up again.",
"But such was not at all the case.",
"I did a very large business.",
"I feel it too much.",
"It will be at the next place they go to, or the next.",
"I guess we want something of that kind.",
"I am of the old school.",
"And yet I do not think I should.",
"She was also in love with him.",
"He did not know whether he should do this or do that.",
"He went home.",
"He now called again.",
"She too had left the place.",
"Why so early home?",
"Yet how may it be!",
"Should we ever have had him back again?",
"This can be no state business.",
"I am out for business.",
"We can set them to work.",
"All of which was only too true.",
"Now, what is to take place?",
"How well off I am!",
"I said it might be so, but I found it hard, at least, to get it out.",
"If I can only keep it up.",
"What have I been doing?",
"It is a little, I am sure.",
"All work done.",
"A fact.",
"The company?",
"The place?",
"It is, however, true.",
"But what care I?",
"Let us know.",
"Well, it is not large.",
"Let him go on at that!",
"Tell him that I give him up.",
"This is not the man for my money.",
"I long to see the book.",
"All at once?",
"If it is, how can I help what is true?",
"Can man say more?",
"If so, let us say no more about it.",
"Here is my problem.",
"I am not much now.",
"But what is man?",
"My case is different.",
"I keep well.",
"I am really very well.",
"And, man!",
"Is that not pretty?",
"And now to business.",
"Second thought.",
"It can be done, it must!",
"But that is an old story, ever new with me.",
"Do it again.",
"I should not care for a whole year.",
"We are all pretty well.",
"First of all, for business.",
"Keep up.",
"Little, small.",
"Great, big.",
"To love.",
"To read.",
"Second day.",
"I go in water.",
"A house.",
"Let it be.",
"Again, back.",
"Small, little.",
"There is no water there.",
"Let me come out.",
"What care we, though we be so small?",
"Was she made away with?",
"Let us do this now.",
"How if it could be true?",
"But there is another group yet.",
"What have we done?",
"If that be true, far more than that must be true.",
"This is business.",
"I called him up.",
"What did he really give, and what did I really give?",
"But this was not the case.",
"Help us yet again and ever.",
"It was a new world at once."],

"Not by no means.",
"It was not all, by any means.",
"I told him I would.",
"They were rather a hard looking set.",
"I told them all about it.",
"The reason why most women do not want money is because they have no use for it.",
"And good news, too!",
"Well, he wanted to know, now!",
"But we can pay.",
"I had my way again that night.",
"Very nice.",
"To have the power and not to use it!",
"Without ever saying much.",
"Very nice of him.",
"I do remember it.",
"She told me about it.",
"It was all about everything.",

"She told us.",
"Now she was in good health again.",
"Would it be work she wanted to do?",
"She did not care about her health.",
"Every day she came to his house and took care of him.",
"The men did work.",
"It was night.",
"They have done nothing.",
"For a long time he said nothing.",
"They wanted to do something, too.",
"This was a new idea to many people.",
"He had run a long way.",
"She told them of what she had done.",
"Several months went by.",
"We start.",
"But a change came in the night.",
"The play is done.",
"But these days are past.",
"At first everything went against him.",
"All present.",
"Nothing much.",
"Try another.",
"They will play nothing else.",
"Believe me, it has not been for want of trying.",
"Everything that he did, I wanted to do.",
"Nothing at all!",
"Of power!",
"Could life become that to her?",
"It is no use talking.",
"I believe it now.",
"But within the last few months there had been a change.",
"He could not remember.",
"How did such people live?",
"Not a bit of it.",
"Told me no end of things.",
"And he was as good as his word.",
"It was good news!",
"But not a bit of it.",
"That was all he had wanted.",
"He took up another.",
"Past it?",
"But nothing of the kind.",
"It had only been a question of time, after all.",
"All work and no play.",
"Let him pay!",
"What, already!",
"What means all this?",
"And live?",
"And live.",
"This night!",
"May I believe this?",
"I know not how to put together.",
"Will she do reason, or so?",
"Nothing was done.",
"He would do nothing more.",
"Yes, I remember.",
"She told him nothing.",
"But the play must be play.",
"All children should live in the country at least for part of the year.",
"But there were many others in which it did not.",
"Sometimes there were more, sometimes less.",
"There was nothing for him to do just yet.",
"There was nothing to support either end of it.",
"No talk of that kind, remember.",
"Who were the men?",
"The season was well along.",
"But he had no support.",
"But we know nothing.",
"I told him no.",
"Now that was past.",
"That news I had got.",
"It sort of has its effect on us.",
"It is not so, however, in many cases.",
"There is no law against it.",
"But nothing was said to her.",
"Try not to think of this.",
"And then the story was told.",
"There was nothing to be seen.",
"She wanted for nothing.",
"I called out to my men.",
"There is no reason for that.",
"That night no more was said.",
"I know nothing.",
"That there could be such men!",
"He was rather nice.",
"The news has come at last.",
"I think that had more to do with it than anything else at first.",
"Not another word!",
"At what time should the little hours be said?",
"The words read.",
"I remember.",
"They read it together.",
"Since then I have read of several similar cases.",
"It is similar to, and yet different from, the others.",
"What is the old line?",
"At them, men!",
"I remember that name.",
"She was at his side.",
"All men are trying.",
"I have others!",
"If he left her without a word, what would she think?",
"President, do not believe this.",
"Do, do come right along with me.",
"I believe it.",
"So now let there be an end of words.",
"Now looking back.",
"Can day be night?",
"Not on such a night.",
"Nothing has come.",
"Not a word!",
"We still have some things to talk over.",
"By no means.",
"There was nothing to do.",
"Too nice.",
"There was nothing to be done.",
"If words would only come!",
"Still words would not come.",
"Who had told me that?",
"Nothing there.",
"I have a sort of idea how his death came about.",
"She had not wanted them.",
"She wanted this.",
"She had no business down here where the men were.",
"I sure wanted to.",
"He wanted to find out if this were true or not.",
"He told him to come to see him again.",
"Then it was level a little way.",
"All the men went in after him.",
"But he would not tell what he wanted to do.",
"He told him not to read them in school.",
"He was trying to remember.",
"They found that they could not take the city.",
"But he did not give up his great idea.",
"He always wanted to do right.",
"He could not think of anything else.",
"But she wanted to make money.",
"When she was very little, she would run away from home.",
"If we have words, we like to use them.",
"Even so with a word.",
"And so with a word.",
"He must have the right word.",
"Sometimes they are.",
"This is the test.",
"He went, and I think his going is significant.",
"People might find out something and talk?",
"His going is significant.",
"All the same, she would not talk about this yet.",
"She had known he wanted something.",
"He might take the money and then use his power again.",
"However, we have to talk about something else.",
"After all, in a sense, I have not done much.",
"How little I remember of her!",
"Nothing more came.",
"He told me that he had.",
"All of these may have been in good health.",
"How still was everything!",
"Just have the line run, and let me know about it.",
"He was often present.",
"The reason is the same.",
"General health?",
"He called to the men in the water.",
"He called the others.",
"I think he took it with him.",
"But he got nothing out of me.",
"But as I said before I had nothing to do with it.",
"I did not go out that night.",
"Nothing was known about my past here.",
"Not a bit of it!",
"He always wanted money.",
"Of course she said nothing to me on that point.",
"But no person.",
"It was for me to talk, not for them.",
"It was some little time before I took in these words.",
"Only what was the question.",
"But I know nothing.",
"That was the question.",
"But what did I believe?",
"What could I believe?",
"Such a night!",
"I had nothing to say.",
"Everything was against me.",
"As well as I can remember, it was like that.",
"So were those of the men.",
"I want him to remember this day.",
"The last few days had told on him.",
"What evidence?",
"If only I could believe this!",
"Would she live?",
"What would her first word be?",
"Get him to talk about it.",
"I could believe her.",
"Evidence of what?",
"She did not remember ever having been in them before.",
"This is all I remember about that.",
"I can say nothing.",
"That will come later.",
"He was looking at me.",
"The next point he made was in the same line.",
"And I had said nothing!",
"I do not believe it.",
"I wanted to know just a little more.",
"There was something else I could do.",
"He wanted to go to her.",
"At all other times she was at his side.",
"For him it was play.",
"Night found her still there.",
"What are city men?",
"And the next day he took away all the people of the city.",
"They came to a city.",
"All the others did the same thing.",
"They went away together.",
"My story is told.",
"Night came.",
"And this I believe we did.",
"This present is nothing to me.",
"Who can say what she will become?",
"There is nothing more just or more true than this.",
"This is nothing.",
"Can nothing be done about this?",
"And so with everything else after its kind.",
"He never could look long at such a night.",
"But I must report to the general.",
"And at last came the word for us.",
"It was something else I wanted.",
"Had she really nothing else to do?",
"They are what they give, and nothing more.",
"We wanted it.",
"My word!",
"But this is by no means the last of it.",
"And with good reason.",
"I will try and put down some of her talk.",
"All night their work went on.",
"It was just on the level of its age.",
"And for another reason, too.",
"Let all men love him.",
"Then up again and another run, and so on.",
"But for what reason?",
"I remember them!",
"Where she is now I have no idea.",
"But I was not the only person who could not make them out.",
"He would look for a likely place to the right.",
"I have never been told so.",
"But they found nothing.",
"He does not know what he is talking about.",
"But their story has not yet been told.",
"But this took some time.",
"That is all I know at present.",
"There was nothing to do but to go back.",
"I told him yes.",
"But nothing came of it.",
"And there will still be nothing to do.",
"He told me of it at the time.",
"I could still remember the last time.",
"They think they can get the paper.",
"I am not saying he will not.",
"She was right in everything she said.",
"It is hard to remember them all.",
"Now into the water when I give the word.",
"He is quite used to it.",
"It is quite all right.",
"The idea came to nothing.",
"Not likely.",
"There was nothing.",
"Good night!",
"I remember now.",
"Not at present.",
"Everything will come right in time.",
"So did many others.",
"He told her his name.",
"What the issue might have been no man can say.",
"What did he believe?",
"Why should we try and say anything more for him?",
"What else could it do?",
"High pay?",
"What, then, does this word mean?",
"Nothing of the kind.",
"What reason is there for it?",
"That is the law.",
"Is that a hard word?",
"Let us think for a while on these great words.",
"What would become of me then?",
"I do not believe it is.",
"Such men will go far, if not this time, then some other time.",
"For they believe what they say, and know what they want.",
"Now, as to this story, all I have to say of it is that I do not believe a word of it.",
"But there was nothing.",
"It, too, has a long history.",
"Run at once and find out.",
"She said nothing.",
"I have live much in very few year.",
"He said not a word.",
"I do not know why men believe women.",
"Good night.",
"I talk of nothing.",
"But I must talk.",
"I believe I did.",
"What a night!",
"More news!",
"Have nothing more to say about it.",
"Try and remember her.",
"He was for a season.",
"Such a thing was wanted, called for.",
"For children or men.",
"Has he bit any of the children yet?",
"We do not live a year in a year now.",
"This was all quite true.",
"He told me of many other cases of a similar kind.",
"There was a reason for this, however.",
"And the reason I know that is that I run the movie every year and the end is always the same.",
"No question about that.",
"He did not believe that death was the end.",
"Of course he had wanted to get home to his family.",
"It only made sense that he would.",
"But this is by no means all.",
"Local work.",
"This world, this present state of things, is but for a time.",
"Everything that could be done the day before was done.",
"What not a word?",
"They very often went out for whole days together, and left me at home.",
"The changes of word are few.",
"We all live on each other.",
"He said nothing.",
"Was it in her power to love any man?",
"He will live.",
"There is nothing more to be done for him.",
"I may be able to do some good yet.",
"Now about the past.",
"Especially the people.",
"I only go to them at night.",
"I want to see them together.",
"She did not want to talk.",
"What sort of a time?",
"No word was said.",
"There was nothing to say.",
"I will try and do the right thing by her.",
"No, she wanted nothing more.",
"They would not talk.",
"It is quite out of the question.",
"Here also was death.",
"What news?",
"No others?",
"And she this side.",
"Love, let me play!",
"She wanted help.",
"But that is a story for others to tell.",
"He took me to his home.",
"It was only the idea of getting something for nothing.",
"I said I had a reason.",
"I know what he means by it.",
"No others can.",
"The thing is working out.",
"The months went by.",
"But he could do nothing more.",
"And she always told him.",
"I did not see the play, though.",
"This is nothing to my story.",
"Would she be able to see her?",
"We must start, though, because we have rather far to go.",
"If only he had not run away!",
"That is probably the reason why he has come home.",
"With these words she went out.",
"He was already there.",
"But he did not want to go and we wanted to keep him.",
"Just try it once!",
"Everything was as it had been then.",
"They were all to be present then.",
"Not by any means.",
"It might be real nice.",
"But I do not mean anything of that sort.",
"That was and is the idea.",
"The idea of.",
"I never let the men get it before me.",
"See how nice it is!",
"It was hard enough the first night, but I came through it.",
"It has a political history of its own.",
"But it seems more likely that he did not know it.",
"In other words.",
"For what live ever here?",
"He will have nothing to show.",
"This actually took place.",
"That took place later.",
"Nothing of this, however, was read in public.",
"But this was done later.",
"This also took place.",
"This took a long time.",
"He was a different type of man from all the others.",
"Look how well they look together!",
"She had told him many things.",
"The people were kind to me, and said nice things about my work.",
"I can give no idea in words of what I there found.",
"Along this we took our course.",
"And so with everything.",
"But what do the last words mean?",
"She who has told so much can tell us no more.",
"He had the car out.",
"So she could not look up and she could not say a word.",
"Nothing but death!",
"The men were there.",
"He wanted to do all.",
"He wanted me to know.",
"He can be told things.",
"Her words had made him start.",
"They went in together.",
"They took it out.",
"But maybe that is only my idea.",
"In that they will become great.",
"I took him around.",
"Death was only a word, too.",
"I wanted to run.",
"We all wanted to.",
"Here he would pay.",
"Let me talk.",
"He said there was nothing to keep me out, and that he would let me know when they came.",
"Question everything else.",
"Do we live up to them?",
"But why not for men?",
"I had a very nice time.",
"But then, that is everything.",
"I could think of nothing else.",
"What would become of her?",
"That will be enough talk.",
"They never try it again.",
"He is that kind, and he has the power.",
"That was ever the way with these men.",
"But he could see nothing.",
"This side up.",
"What else could I think?",
"Talk about system.",
"She wanted to get up and run from him.",
"She wanted to look away and could not.",
"It is a question of life and death.",
"She would tell him everything!",
"How had she thought well of him down in the city?",
"She thought little of them, having much else to think of.",
"She could run!",
"If it were not so there would be little told of it.",
"There was really nothing to tell.",
"It is hard for me to believe this.",
"Everything in life is done for them.",
"This is a live issue.",
"There must be nothing good to tell!",
"They had nothing against him.",
"I told him it could not be.",
"They wanted to know where I had come from, and all about me.",
"I told them nothing.",
"They were quite right on the last guess.",
"But what else could she have done?",
"She would be shown the way!",
"To play an important part in a play?",
"There is a reason.",
"The law was with him, I believe, in that.",
"It is very hard to get enough to live.",
"There is other evidence.",
"But that was not the whole reason.",
"Now they have something to do, they are men of business.",
"However, I said nothing.",
"But he did just as he was told.",
"They took great care of him.",
"And he went back to his paper.",
"That is what they go to the city for.",
"More than we wanted.",
"But we must get on and not talk here all day.",
"They can run out again.",
"But what am I saying?",
"He wanted to go, yet he could be of no use.",
"I believe in love.",
"It never took place.",
"What should the words be?",
"He thought it significant.",
"A week later they came again.",
"A week later they came yet again!",
"And so, even in that case, the paper has got into its place first.",
"Nothing very much.",
"And with what an effect!",
"They are all of the same sort.",
"I got a few in line.",
"Then we can talk it over.",
"So many went down last night.",
"I know that, for we used to try it.",
"I feel at home here already.",
"They are things of the past.",
"Of that later.",
"That sort of thing will not do now.",
"Is there nothing more to be done on our side?",
"We would not support them if we did not.",
"That, however, is a question by the way.",
"No news is good news.",
"With him I have nothing to do.",
"I told him sure I would.",
"It was nice there.",
"Maybe we can help him later.",
"She told me all about it.",
"And believe me, that was true.",
"Have some sense.",
"And that was every bit as far as I could go.",
"They took him in.",
"I could see they all thought that he took the money.",
"They had something else to do.",
"Then I told them all about it.",
"People talk about them to this day.",
"Why nothing, of course!",
"The words were out.",
"Me just got home, and never did a single thing to them!",
"She told me not to go on the water, and I went.",
"Not a bit of me out.",
"Come along.",
"He had come for nothing.",
"There had been a test.",
"We must live.",
"That was not, however, the reason.",
"They are so hard to remember.",
"But, would he keep looking back?",
"And then he said nothing.",
"We all did it together.",
"Try it and see.",
"To man is given great power, but it is not his own power.",
"How did I come to be here at night?",
"The book is everything but a story book.",
"Last night had come again.",
"Nothing like that.",
"I could not talk about it.",
"I never like to talk about it.",
"This is their second year, I believe.",
"Tell us what it means.",
"Of course we believe it.",
"This is a hard saying.",
"Another says, not quite that.",
"It is a story for all men and all times.",
"There are those who do not believe this.",
"Yes, it is good that we should all remember this.",
"We do not know the reason of that.",
"This they were to remember, because it was true.",
"And this we are to remember, because it is more or less true of us.",
"Nothing new could be true.",
"He will say nothing of them but good.",
"Nothing less.",
"Same way with everything.",
"The other half was with the story in the book.",
"After that there was no more talk.",
"And how would he ever be able to pay him back?",
"He wanted to make the big man talk.",
"So here I am trying to do something and doing nothing.",
"And keep talking to him all the time.",
"We got a job.",
"But what right have we to use these words?",
"That is a hard saying.",
"There was nothing more to be said.",
"But this was by no means all.",
"And looking so well!",
"I found it to be quite true.",
"But she said nothing.",
"Then there are others.",
"It was to be a long story with big words in it.",
"Why should he not live the same life as the others?",
"It was a nice state of things.",
"I can believe that.",
"I know nothing about anything else.",
"For my part I have an idea.",
"He is still on the run.",
"He had no means of his own at all.",
"It was true, however, that they had to call for the others there.",
"There was no life without death.",
"After that there would be nothing.",
"He came along.",
"No, there was nothing yet.",
"That was the end of everything!",
"Later on we will see.",
"What good would it do to tell him everything at once?",
"The others had everything and he nothing.",
"What an idea!",
"But they wanted to do all they could.",
"Reason as before.",
"But who would believe her?",
"We see now, not only guess, what it means.",
"What, from nothing?",
"Why, death, and nothing else but present death.",
"All night!",
"The words I said!",
"Or do they know already I am he?",
"He did but try her!",
"What law?",
"For men?",
"Do not believe her.",
"What should I not believe?",
"I, that had the power.",
"Night came on.",
"I was just like him, at his age.",
"What else can we do?",
"They were to be shown every thing there was to see.",
"For this, much has already been done.",
"What the paper was I need not say.",
"Or do we believe nothing of the sort?",
"But death must come for him.",
"There are some men of that sort.",
"We told each other everything.",
"In all of which he was quite right.",
"But that is not the question.",
"For there were as many men as women present.",
"But he will try.",
"I think it likely that he is.",
"Everything seems to point to it.",
"Everything I read.",
"That is quite different.",
"That is what makes him different from other men.",
"He was all things, to all men.",
"She could see nothing.",
"He was a great general.",
"It is good to believe him.",
"That is the very reason why I am more nice about them.",
"In fact, nothing could be said to it.",
"He has nothing to think of but how to get well.",
"And then it was such a bit of money!",
"This is the time present.",
"With what effect I do not know.",
"The words were nothing.",
"How could they live without it?",
"So he came up with another idea.",
"That was quite bad!",
"It will also effect much with the people.",
"This was done several times, but with the same effect.",
"It is nothing.",
"But come, men!",
"But I am again to remember not to talk about it.",
"Do I look nice, really?",
"That will be so nice when we go home.",
"We say, I am too old now to start this or that new sort of work.",
"But I did, and I told him so.",
"She thought, she who had had quite enough to do the day before, that I did not call her because I thought she did not want to get up.",
"But that is not his job, it is not what he came out to do.",
"But that again is not his job.",
"At least we believe not.",
"It is the great fact of the age.",
"I will not believe it!",
"If I could play now, it would be only with little children.",
"But I must live.",
"He had nothing to say.",
"As they are, so will he be, in every age and country.",
"What power then have we?",
"Nothing of the sort.",
"Did they want any power in that country?",
"The evidence is there for him to use.",
"There is the other side.",
"Now, she thought I was the man she had been looking for.",
"But here was nothing of the sort.",
"Remember her?",
"No, nothing.",
"There was much to talk about.",
"Who else?",
"There was nothing she could do, either.",
"Later on it will be different.",
"He had at least the present!",
"He was a man of the present.",
"Nothing doing.",
"She said nothing because she could not.",
"They left the place together.",
"It was to be his night.",
"But there was something else.",
"I may just as well start a new life in a new country.",
"Then we will talk.",
"Sometimes I think that she would.",
"Of course, he did nothing of the sort.",
"I want to live!",
"Let this be the last word.",
"They were all looking up here.",
"Not a bit.",
"But we found nothing.",
"Night set in.",
"The next night I put it back again.",
"Anything else?",
"Make a job of it.",
"And while he was so looking at him.",
"Why should they remember him?",
"But where else did he go?",
"I took a good look at him.",
"There was something else.",
"Had it been run?",
"He could not remember!",
"He was quite right.",
"Her and me have already done it.",
"I know it already!",
"The reason why?",
"The night is come.",
"She did not remember them.",
"It was ever the same old words.",
"Yes, yes, of course I wanted it.",
"Quite right!",
"Where are all the others?",
"Why, she could remember almost every word.",
"They told each other everything.",
"Now, come, remember!",
"What a lot of money they must have cost!",
"Do I not play my part as well as I can?",
"It is I who have found out what is wanted by the people who can help us.",
"It is bad news.",
"There is nothing else, I think.",
"There was something else I wanted to say.",
"Come back with me and let us live for each other, live for love.",
"Who am I that she should remember me?",
"Then they went both together.",
"That is not likely, said the other.",
"I am nothing.",
"I can do nothing.",
"To pay him?",
"They took them off later on.",
"What was he looking for?",
"How many men are there?",
"They were talking without order.",
"I was told of this.",
"Believe me.",
"He had run hard.",
"Everything is there.",
"They are there already.",
"What was the name of this general?",
"He was still present.",
"They took them from them.",
"Let us say a few words of it.",
"And yet others.",
"I told him my name.",
"Let us go back a few hours.",
"He then told me his name.",
"What, then, is in question?",
"These were his last words.",
"I was working.",
"It was at night.",
"Nothing more.",
"I have done nothing.",
"Everything is possible.",
"It did nothing of the kind.",
"What are these men?",
"Here there is nothing of the kind.",
"Take my death!",
"Who are else in it?",
"Will not death any man?",
"Men enough.",
"What order should we take?",
"And nothing else?",
"Nothing to me?",
"Am I come from doing to talking?",
"That is the question before us.",
"The real test was to come.",
"There were others.",
"It was on the left side.",
"There is reason for it.",
"There is death about them.",
"So it was in death.",
"I have already said what he was like in his old age.",
"The test was made at last.",
"He could not or would not run away.",
"And what a season of it he had!",
"I wanted to do things.",
"But at night!",
"There is nothing like it in the world!",
"He told his story.",
"This was not quite true.",
"It was in that way so many good things have come down to the present day.",
"I did not at that time know the reason.",
"But what would I have given to be able to do so?",
"Let us go in by all means.",
"I said it was quite large enough.",
"In the very early cases the law.",
"It did not take him very long to test me.",
"Such was the law.",
"There was, however, no law in the case.",
"It was much more than life and death to this man.",
"And so we found our present home.",
"But, after all, what the home is to be is not within our power to say.",
"So now to our present history.",
"Along what way?",
"I want to pay for that, too.",
"She went there quite often.",
"He got me on at a side show.",
"He told me a lot of things about his business.",
"He went to the end of the car.",
"What does he talk about?",
"And think, we should be making history!",
"Very likely we did not.",
"So I told her.",
"I did try the book.",
"I had had early evidence of this.",
"It is for the reason that we know them and that they know us that we love them.",
"A likely story!",
"What had become of her?",
"It was the only word he, could think of.",
"Which car was it?",
"He had to play the play out.",
"Come and get him, if they wanted him!",
"Was it night?",
"This he did in few words.",
"She would have called out but the words would not come.",
"Hours went by.",
"For what reason?",
"They took her away the next day.",
"He could not talk away what he had done or the thing that he was.",
"There was nothing else for her to do.",
"Still they said nothing.",
"Try as he would, he could not get set.",
"But she could not find the words to tell him so.",
"Very likely what she said was true.",
"She could not do it even if it were within her power.",
"He wanted her.",
"His look was significant.",
"If he called on them to do more, they would make a try with him.",
"The real reason why he was going he had not given.",
"They were off to an early start.",
"Probably nothing to it.",
"She told him.",
"Men do in this country a lot.",
"And I try to be.",
"Quite so.",
"That is likely, is it not?",
"But now I am like the others.",
"I could not remember a single line that I had to say.",
"No, there was nothing.",
"Looking well!",
"Good health!",
"I told her that I was going too.",
"Love is quite different.",
"No question about it.",
"Her are much good and nice.",
"He may already have more power than we think he has.",
"He had no idea what else to say.",
"That is quite true, of course.",
"Believe me!",
"I told her I could give her everything she wanted.",
"However, I will pay him for it.",
"The news was known.",
"I remember that!",
"But he said nothing.",
"Who would believe it?",
"That is what I am told he did.",
"He took.",
"They will try to use me.",
"They may try to make him talk.",
"What use, if I do try?",
"But they would not be told.",
"I say, among the men.",
"That is a likely guess.",
"Believe it not.",
"So is history read.",
"No word of all this.",
"And yet the words are true.",
"She was at that age.",
"Of course there was nothing.",
"They were all looking at her.",
"They told.",
"Any night.",
"She had no idea what to say.",
"Because he wanted me.",
"But after all she told him nothing.",
"He went on, not looking at her.",
"This is no place to live.",
"They took me along so that if anything was wanted I could do it.",
"I remember well the day she came.",
"He and I were the last to start.",
"He said he would try and see what he could do for me.",
"The question was out, at last.",
"She wanted them to read that!",
"No, we must say nothing.",
"Hard to live with!",
"I believe she is trying to do it now.",
"Still, she said nothing.",
"They were not talking as they came.",
"Were they not all together?",
"And I still live?",
"He does look nice.",
"The first must become last.",
"The question is, which way and how?",
"This was a new idea.",
"I wanted to do the same.",
"And without reason?",
"She is not quite like other people.",
"It seems to be just a general state of health.",
"She is going to the city.",
"She was looking at it when she was in.",
"I took it.",
"She wanted very much to go home.",
"There was nothing to do but go.",
"Believe me, I have thought of all that.",
"And what are the others going to get?",
"I told her.",
"There must have been a reason.",
"It was just talk.",
"Still, there was nothing in that.",
"It was later even than he had thought.",
"He could say nothing, do nothing.",
"Yet he must try.",
"Men are so different from women.",
"I must be with her day and night.",
"Sometimes I think I used to know her.",
"Sometimes it is a man.",
"He could never live through it!",
"She had said no word.",
"This has always been the law.",
"There is nothing more to be said.",
"He means well.",
"Very likely we did.",
"Everything I care for most.",
"I told him I thought I could.",
"At the present time!",
"But was that likely?",
"Then we can talk.",
"What else could I do?",
"There was no reason why he should have done so.",
"But there were others.",
"He is wanted!",
"They are quite different.",
"I wanted to do things my own way.",
"I took them out.",
"But I wanted to know more.",
"It may have had no effect at all.",
"I am sure that he will not be able to do it.",
"To have to run around and see this man and that man is not the way to do.",
"The cases were different.",
"Try him again, then.",
"I must see the general.",
"The only way was to try and see.",
"Where had those words been used before?",
"It must be done in person.",
"Sometimes, but not often, we found it.",
"Give me or death.",
"Now, men, who will go down?",
"That is why I am here in person.",
"I run away.",
"I remember him about the first thing.",
"Should he try?",
"It will be found on my person.",
"All night?",
"Not a bit, old thing.",
"State of those who live in the country.",
"People may come to do anything by talking of it.",
"Such, I take it, is the state of those who live in the country.",
"However, I could have done nothing against him.",
"I found no level part.",
"He told me so long ago.",
"Then he went to the study without looking back.",
"I believe she had next to nothing.",
"But there must be a looking down or a looking up.",
"I know nothing of business.",
"She was as still as death.",
"I want the real history of the last few months.",
"So I came over here to talk business.",
"Now for my side.",
"But the question was, how was the thing to be done, and where?",
"They were kind to him, because they wanted to make use of him.",
"But is there nothing else against me?",
"Here is something already.",
"Have they not already done so?",
"People may believe it or not.",
"If it means nothing, after all!",
"Must I believe it true!",
"By night and day I work.",
"The people did not know what she was talking about.",
"After a little he told me his story.",
"I remember him well.",
"No children in the house to play!",
"Quite new.",
"Very likely.",
"The law was not made for such a man as me.",
"This will do, I believe.",
"We are quite out again.",
"He did not read a line of it.",
"I told him I was.",
"I am told it does.",
"This is saying something for him.",
"The women know this as well as the men.",
"I question whether ever it will be what it was.",
"But so I believe I said before.",
"And so she went on talking.",
"Then she told them a story.",
"There were men and women and several children in it.",
"They could not see the others, of course.",
"How could they play with her?",
"It was their business to live for him.",
"She did not know what would become of her, or where she was going.",
"And I do so want to talk of it.",
"The idea!",
"There were no other words.",
"It was quite some time ago.",
"And I do nothing.",
"They need help more than the others.",
"Where did everything go?",
"But to our play.",
"What, will it still be night?",
"And reason, too.",
"Not a word more!",
"What else?",
"What means this?",
"How else, but to death?",
"It is still too much in the first line.",
"Just nothing at all.",
"They had done everything that could be thought of.",
"From those who have nothing we can take nothing, or very little.",
"I might get others.",
"There is nothing in that.",
"But he did nothing of the kind.",
"That will never do, believe me.",
"Now for a test.",
"He would have nothing to do with women.",
"But at what a cost!",
"Then she told the good news.",
"Many there were who told of such things.",
"So I come along.",
"Have some sense, man.",
"Nothing but.",
"Every word.",
"Instead he bit him.",
"Not half.",
"Who else could it be?",
"And when he went he took me with him.",
"Nothing else to do.",
"She told me.",
"They said nothing.",
"Nothing to do with this business.",
"Try something new for a change.",
"He told her.",
"They did find something else.",
"I never thought anything else.",
"There was an idea.",
"They know something but not everything.",
"And what did he live on?",
"And he took him out.",
"And he was quite right.",
"He was long past that.",
"But not quite.",
"He is a nice man.",
"It will be quite like old times.",
"They become great men.",
"I like those with me who do not talk.",
"Those others!",
"I could make nothing of it.",
"Yes, I remember the case quite well.",
"We know nothing about him.",
"He means it.",
"And how did he know what I believe?",
"I never told him.",
"Not in law.",
"But there is no such evidence.",
"And do not try to see me for a little while.",
"They are nothing of the kind.",
"Take the question of time.",
"Each side wanted it.",
"Half the children that come into the world go out of it before they are good for anything.",
"Can we make anything else of it, either more or less?",
"But they have it in their power to do much more than they are at present doing.",
"It may be so, but I do not believe it.",
"Now, there is nothing that can do this but water.",
"But I do not believe this.",
"Try me.",
"He had found nothing.",
"She would pay it.",
"Of course I remember.",
"We know, however, nothing about them.",
"It must be general.",
"However, remember this!",
"I have nothing to do with him.",
"It told the whole story.",
"He is everything to me.",
"With those words he went out.",
"What to do was the question.",
"Why was this support given?",
"However, it is not for me to talk.",
"Either, however, makes sense.",
"Again we will tell it in his own words.",
"But now for the night!",
"But all these changes had not come in a day.",
"There was nothing to do next day.",
"There was probably very little said about death.",
"We see so much that we see nothing.",
"What need of many words?",
"I may live many years yet.",
"No, she would say nothing.",
"That is its history.",
"I have done nothing!",
"There was no time by day or night that he could call his own.",
"Was it life or death?",
"She thought it all over bit by bit.",
"Else how can I keep his money?",
"How can she believe in him?",
"Go and see a play?",
"It was a question, and this was it.",
"Nothing else to do!",
"He went over everything.",
"I wanted to know what people would say to me.",
"And what would life be but for the power to do so?",
"She did not quite like it, but she did it.",
"We know of nothing like them in any past age or country.",
"I know that just as good a case can be made out for the other side.",
"Where and who are its men?",
"What pretty words they have!",
"This would be enough for the present.",
"I will say more about it later on.",
"The life and age of man.",
"My everything!",
"There was nothing more to be done about that.",
"They run, they run!",
"Nothing more is known of him, not even his name.",
"It is a law.",
"Of this, however, I said nothing.",
"All this I know, for I have been told.",
"Which side went in first?",
"It is not quite so.",
"It would be a great help to me if we could read a book together.",
"He told her the whole story.",
"And yet, what am I saying?",
"She had not become what she was because death was before her.",
"Why not start at once?",
"But I told them.",
"And so, the night.",
"There is nothing else for me to do.",
"Now, if ever, is the time to call the men.",
"Sometimes they did not come back.",
"What I wanted was the true course.",
"Just what I wanted.",
"No case like it had ever been reported.",
"The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him.",
"And it was night.",
"On what law?",
"The end of those things is death.",
"We live now.",
"There is nothing in anything.",
"Live through it.",
"But that is not the question now.",
"Yet, even here, and among these, something had been done already.",
"Is there nothing else?",
"Then by no means put him to death.",
"Then by all means change it.",
"I have seen so many changes.",
"What a night that was for me!",
"There is nothing in them which can do me any good.",
"But in a sense it is true.",
"I would have nothing more to do with her.",
"But it was all for nothing.",
"Yet I have had some talk.",
"The idea of it!",
"Start at once.",
"So I said nothing.",
"We may have work to do before night.",
"Why else could it be?",
"What do I talk of bad or good?",
"And I believe I can.",
"And such a little while ago all children together!",
"Is there no word of it?",
"That is, I think, all that can be said by way of news.",
"This is a great order, is it not?",
"But all this is a question of money.",
"Say half done.",
"I believe that this is the most of our business.",
"News, news, news.",
"I am going to try!",
"I believe.",
"To run.",
"To pay.",
"A city.",
"Pay again.",
"That is all the question.",
"Is this only a little power?",
"That is quite true.",
"And what have they told us?",
"Only men do.",
"Who is do no work, and for what pay?",
"They all said something of this sort to me.",
"As I have already said, I did not help any of these people.",
"We will work together.",
"I live in the country.",
"This is what he told me.",
"Hours are early.",
"The night was very long.",
"The women only did what the men told them."],

["I always mind my own business.",
"I asked him if he had seen or heard anything.",
"Of late!",
"However, be this as it may, I saw them at last.",
"Like a hand!",
"I feel little interest.",
"Then a thought comes to me.",
"The public was interesting too.",
"No man could have a room in the house.",
"Where am I free?",
"How am I free?",
"Much of it is in the man himself.",
"I open a market, or close it.",
"How do other men in public life deal with this problem?",
"What is thinking?",
"I started from her.",
"The fact was, we had lost her.",
"No result.",
"But it was from the other that the questions came.",
"At the end of that time I made up my mind that it would be just as well to get back to business.",
"There they were lost.",
"Now we saw that that was not enough.",
"That was the last I ever saw of him.",
"I took stock.",
"Just as much risk here, perhaps.",
"It was black.",
"Good enough, far as it goes.",
"All was open as the day.",
"Then I saw what it really was.",
"Says so himself.",
"He gets it open.",
"Minutes, hours, were nothing.",
"We must buy him off.",
"Is the world to go on thus, always?",
"So I made up my mind to watch for him.",
"But no matter.",
"At last she heard him.",
"Thus it was.",
"It is not too late!",
"All this is wrong.",
"Why is not all that taken?",
"I had already made up my mind how to act.",
"After a time he left the room.",
"So they started.",
"What was it she saw?",
"But what does it really matter?",
"He always wanted a great deal of money.",
"He said so himself.",
"And now it was coming to an end.",
"Perhaps he was in love with someone.",
"Why, we went on the wrong night.",
"She started.",
"She had never asked him to go away.",
"He took her hand.",
"She went into the other room.",
"She still left her hand in his.",
"He might do a great deal of good.",
"Black people live there.",
"She started a day school for the children.",
"He did what she asked.",
"He let them go free.",
"But I will not set him free.",
"In a few minutes he came back.",
"Days and weeks went by.",
"The people came with their family problems and wanted her to tell them what to do.",
"Many of them had never seen black people before.",
"Here she heard good news.",
"Instead of this she asked for something else.",
"The men could do whatever they wanted to do with them.",
"But my stuff comes back.",
"I called without response.",
"His second taken up and let out.",
"Just never saw the like.",
"Watch out!",
"Here goes.",
"Come close.",
"Then it lost.",
"He was now pretty free to do this.",
"But it does not much matter.",
"It was a matter of life or death to him.",
"Having once made up my mind, however, nothing could change it.",
"We heard no more of them after that.",
"I heard it not.",
"Lead on!",
"Activity is the order of the day here.",
"Perhaps not!",
"No matter.",
"Then she left the room.",
"He started.",
"At last she was free to go to her room.",
"It was his hand!",
"Everyone made way for him.",
"A hand?",
"He put up his hand to his head.",
"What did any risk matter?",
"What did it matter?",
"It made him very interesting.",
"But it was not either that he saw.",
"Turn out everything.",
"But what did these things matter?",
"But who comes here?",
"The matter?",
"I know nothing of the matter.",
"Was it a going in or coming out?",
"No matter, out with it.",
"Everyone has a right to do that.",
"She saw this now.",
"It did not matter.",
"What does it matter what he did?",
"Well, it was too late now.",
"And is he wrong?",
"I did not see him, but got some of his information at second hand.",
"But the season was late.",
"As a matter of course, I was left.",
"I had heard much of him, and never any good.",
"But his words put me in mind of my own business.",
"But I do not think she was ever many minutes out of my mind.",
"They saw it.",
"I asked him what he said.",
"Never mind what that means.",
"Then I took her hand.",
"But I do not think she heard me.",
"As it was they were too late.",
"At any rate, I can try.",
"He asked where the other was.",
"I was long past taking any care.",
"Their parents would have something to say about that.",
"He put a hand over his left side.",
"He said many hard things of her in his own mind as he went away.",
"Those who do it do it at their own risk.",
"But I have done a wrong!",
"And other changes had taken place.",
"Many things there had been in her mind to say to him.",
"It all comes over me now.",
"And thus once more we went on.",
"He had everything in his hand.",
"He put up his hand.",
"When I am present nothing ever comes off.",
"And then I saw what he had said.",
"We went up to his room when we went in.",
"I asked no information.",
"It must be here in this room.",
"How goes the night?",
"But never mind that, it will keep.",
"She started the car.",
"Perhaps it is not too late to get back.",
"He is very low.",
"He must keep everything in mind.",
"Now they are in the room.",
"Come to my room.",
"Perhaps he had lost his way.",
"I have no interest in him.",
"If they are not taken, they will come back for us.",
"Had he some evidence that she had not heard?",
"Perhaps they had news that might be of help.",
"He described the house.",
"This may seem hard, but it is not.",
"If not, why, no matter.",
"What matter for that?",
"He came to the front of the house.",
"But, after all, perhaps he did not need to say all these things.",
"Yet the hand was interesting for all that.",
"At any rate, he lost no time.",
"Too late.",
"This is the fact of the matter.",
"Very full.",
"I came down on my head.",
"Why not the left hand?",
"Always my mind came back to that.",
"But then he usually does.",
"At any rate, I had to take the risk.",
"It must have been put in working order quite recently.",
"Now I open it.",
"And it has an interesting history.",
"She must have been out of her mind.",
"But he said nothing on this head.",
"Development must come from within.",
"His mind had been full of her.",
"Never mind.",
"She had taken him at last.",
"Thus has it been since that day.",
"He saw things for himself.",
"When he did not come back, they thought that he had lost his way.",
"She saw what he had been doing.",
"But it was too late.",
"It was too late.",
"The country was free at last.",
"They got home too late to start that day.",
"They did not keep close together after they set out.",
"They set this down in front of the head.",
"Their country was to be free.",
"She asked him to let her look at it.",
"It came to them across the water.",
"He started a paper of his own.",
"What do these words as thus used mean?",
"Which is the more often thus used?",
"What is the number usually given?",
"What will be the result that comes out of it all?",
"In no country perhaps in the world is the law so general a study.",
"I was then taken a second time.",
"Thus I came by my name.",
"In a few minutes his work was hard.",
"These had run for several weeks, but without result.",
"There is room enough here.",
"They are full of life.",
"They have their full effect there.",
"It was late.",
"It was too late to question now.",
"It was too late to think now.",
"They never saw him again.",
"But he is coming now.",
"But now they are thinking of other things.",
"I put out my hand to feel.",
"Whose were they?",
"I have lost a great deal.",
"Perhaps I did.",
"It was in the next room.",
"I saw no more.",
"He is coming to her.",
"Why have so long a head?",
"That is but a development, too, is it not?",
"Still no result.",
"As a matter of fact, both men were right.",
"He was lost in thought.",
"But he was wrong.",
"A few minutes later the work was done.",
"He was too late.",
"It would not turn.",
"My plan is this.",
"If it comes, make the most of it.",
"There was something wrong.",
"The result was the same.",
"So I went across to her.",
"Yes, she was sure she would know the plan again if she saw it.",
"What does it matter?",
"She had been in the room, then.",
"It had not yet been taken out.",
"Why not the whole town!",
"He was wrong.",
"This was my plan.",
"Would like to tell us something, perhaps.",
"Well, never mind, run along.",
"He had seen a good deal of life.",
"Give me a room.",
"What had been in her mind?",
"A change had taken place in him.",
"What was in his mind?",
"It was not quite full, at that time.",
"What was coming?",
"I was not thinking about that.",
"Was it too late?",
"I was not in the room with them when he did this.",
"But I was too late.",
"I did not know what to do, or which way to turn.",
"This, before I left the room.",
"Then I set my mind on going home.",
"At last he was free of men.",
"He did not mind it now.",
"There was no time to turn.",
"The man was thinking.",
"She goes with him.",
"It was a head.",
"The man had heard every word of this.",
"They started on the way.",
"It did not open.",
"He lost no time in following.",
"He comes!",
"To which part will she turn?",
"All this is lost.",
"If thus, why not?",
"I never saw such stock before.",
"I have been thinking over it.",
"He did not, however, see for some time to what he could turn it.",
"But I had started from him.",
"But what is the matter?",
"Turn them both out, I say!",
"So he had to take his plan back again.",
"I can thus much.",
"Most of them are going to the front for the first time.",
"Let me turn now to the last.",
"He asked her why.",
"But now a new idea came into her mind.",
"They are probably still in the town.",
"There was, however, no response.",
"He only came a month ago.",
"I saw I was lost.",
"My only thought was of she who was now lost to me.",
"The response came in a few minutes.",
"That was the last I saw of her.",
"Perhaps he did not know him so well as I did.",
"They are wrong, however.",
"When they were in front of us, we saw a good deal of them.",
"And so without further words he left me.",
"Again I started to turn away.",
"Watch me, and remember the things I do.",
"I would not be outside.",
"He never even started.",
"I was thinking.",
"Perhaps this was he.",
"He could not control himself.",
"I have been wrong.",
"Such a thing was never heard of.",
"She saw it all.",
"As for going himself that was quite out of the question.",
"But how different the result!",
"Is not that the question of all questions?",
"I know many people do not think thus.",
"I am wrong.",
"At any rate it is by far the most interesting thing left to us in the city.",
"Among these not the least is that of the first site of the town.",
"What we have lost!",
"But that did not matter.",
"Come to my room at once.",
"Just now I free.",
"It can never be described.",
"But help was at hand.",
"My head is quite bad.",
"I know it will seem that way at first.",
"But I was wrong.",
"That was all he had ever asked.",
"I heard him say so!",
"I should have seen this coming.",
"It has taken me years.",
"Night too was close at hand.",
"The end was now close at hand.",
"The stock, however, was small.",
"Law himself?",
"I never heard her say so many good things.",
"Should it then be thus?",
"The watch by this time had come up to the place.",
"And she asked him of what country he was.",
"I am coming, I am coming!",
"How interesting!",
"I have heard them before.",
"He had heard all this before.",
"The others in the room could not see her at all.",
"I was just coming to that.",
"But I have heard what it is.",
"He took them from my room, but he did not get them all.",
"It would seem that she had something more to say.",
"More is coming.",
"But she does a great deal.",
"She heard nothing.",
"She could not make up her mind how to take him.",
"We asked, and they heard us not.",
"He has heard all we have said.",
"It was coming.",
"Sometimes it is so with children and parents.",
"There was no time to be lost.",
"I have taken a house.",
"I do not mind.",
"Give room!",
"Call to the watch!",
"Some have come just to be coming, and others seem to be here for business.",
"He had heard that before.",
"But this was interesting him, outside himself.",
"His parents were all for it.",
"But many of her children were late in getting here.",
"They are a little close, maybe.",
"And much that must be done in the long run has not yet been started.",
"The thing he saw had been there all the time.",
"In a word, she was never heard of more.",
"This was the close.",
"Seen a good deal?",
"The hand.",
"This will keep for several weeks.",
"Never mind that!",
"I had heard that once before!",
"What was the matter?",
"We have never heard anything like it.",
"I never saw it again.",
"Almost at the turn!",
"Not I, by a good deal!",
"There is no room for any other person.",
"Who is coming there?",
"What could be the matter?",
"I am taking care of her, remember.",
"What a room it was!",
"Did I value my home before?",
"I saw him once.",
"If it ever comes.",
"It was different from anything that had taken place before.",
"It was every man for himself.",
"They said they would and I asked them to tell their men to do the same.",
"Is it not thus?",
"But enough of that matter.",
"Why they never heard of me!",
"Then my mind was made up.",
"He has to try to find out what is in the mind of others.",
"Their thinking is done for them by officials.",
"She comes!",
"He comes, he comes!",
"Look at the matter.",
"What they saw or did not see I know not, and did not then care to think.",
"We know that he is coming, we see him.",
"But then, what did it matter?",
"I never saw so little of it as there is here.",
"Never mind my name.",
"It was full.",
"He asked no more.",
"He went out to the front of the house.",
"Perhaps there were many.",
"He had not asked.",
"He asked nothing.",
"I seem to have come to another world.",
"There was no time to plan.",
"She must change his mind.",
"Another change was coming over him.",
"My mind is not large enough.",
"I must close.",
"But I saw more than that in it.",
"As a matter of fact, this was not true.",
"Just back from the front.",
"But he could not help himself.",
"Not so many days, weeks, months back he had been a different man.",
"He would never see that room again.",
"Something was lost out of them.",
"Too late!",
"He comes to once in a while.",
"He called another man, and asked him to show me whatever I wanted to see.",
"I never saw her but once.",
"There is something wrong there.",
"He must be taken care of, before he does have any.",
"This did not seem likely.",
"But for this I was too late.",
"To do this we must act.",
"No, higher than that.",
"Of his mind I say nothing, of course.",
"This, too, the man saw.",
"And that is as close as he ever comes to saying anything.",
"For she had seen him coming to the house.",
"The new day has already started.",
"He saw her.",
"She did not know whether he had heard her.",
"But still going further from her.",
"Then he saw.",
"Then he did turn.",
"This was another matter to see about.",
"She did not turn her head to look at him.",
"They could go no further.",
"And what next does he plan?",
"He had it coming.",
"He put his hand on her.",
"And then she saw.",
"He could turn his head a little.",
"Perhaps more than once.",
"It was coming on.",
"There were perhaps too many of them.",
"She had heard this many times.",
"I did not know that the members were thinking of doing the work!",
"Perhaps, though, she had never been in love!",
"We have asked them to come back.",
"He was always getting in wrong just trying to help people.",
"But say, he sure started something when he got these women after him.",
"I never heard anything like it.",
"Not once had she seen him since the day she had been in his office.",
"But what of a time further away?",
"Perhaps it will help a little if I tell a story.",
"Then I asked them what we should do about it.",
"Then I took a turn around the room.",
"It has done a great deal of good.",
"The next thing was to call for new members.",
"A lot of us started out after him.",
"We only saw her for a little while every day.",
"Now, I must really close my story.",
"She asked if he thought she would find any thing.",
"Thinking of this, what could she do?",
"No saw!",
"Is it coming back?",
"Up at last and into the room.",
"He never saw her again.",
"And thus I end this paper.",
"And that is about all that I can say on the matter.",
"For himself.",
"But it goes on even today.",
"Then some more development.",
"Why this should be so is an interesting question.",
"A second head had by this time shown up.",
"They all saw it now.",
"There was really no need of further words.",
"Never mind about her now.",
"He told me so himself.",
"What more than this can he say for himself?",
"Later on perhaps.",
"She comes.",
"A further development of the same thought.",
"There was no response.",
"At the end he asked a single question.",
"They started.",
"Perhaps we may never see each other more.",
"They saw each other at least once every day.",
"Sure, sure it comes this way.",
"It was a wrong guess, however.",
"The change came like another act of a play.",
"He came too late.",
"They are coming.",
"The women, perhaps.",
"Perhaps people always did get through!",
"I am full of business that I like.",
"I had never been through anything compared to this.",
"They used to look at it and talk about home and plan what she would do in that little house.",
"I thought I never could interest them.",
"But I heard something, too.",
"He went to the next room.",
"But I know how it goes.",
"He did care a great deal.",
"Is it on the whole going right or going wrong?",
"But need he love his parents less?",
"He had lost all, by trying to do right.",
"Why does each kind turn into its kind?",
"Now I do not say that this is wrong.",
"I say, they do not want to be free.",
"Why should they not take care of their interest?",
"The book was still in his hand.",
"But only half his mind was with them.",
"It was almost as though they had heard of the thing he had come to do and were there to watch.",
"All the way he was thinking hard.",
"I just asked him.",
"I took a bad turn a while back.",
"Keep on thinking.",
"A great change had taken place.",
"Did he turn back?",
"What good does thinking do me?",
"What comes of it?",
"Let his days be few, and another take his office.",
"He who does not think of himself and his own interest will be the very man who will really help himself, and further his own interest the most.",
"These last he heard not often enough by half.",
"But no matter!",
"But it may be that I have a plan.",
"What act?",
"He made himself as small as possible.",
"They all got out to see what was the matter.",
"She started but once.",
"What a deal of room we take up!",
"What was the matter, then?",
"Why was it that she heard nothing?",
"Again, a month went by.",
"But as yet I know nothing further.",
"What was wrong?",
"What mean these questions?",
"Whose words are these?",
"But here she comes.",
"The head?",
"The very head.",
"And thus late too?",
"Who goes there?",
"It was already late.",
"He must see the watch again, and again think over it.",
"There were men at work in almost every room.",
"Known what was coming?",
"And they were both wrong.",
"I thought I saw something like it.",
"Open it!",
"There were no women taken with them.",
"And they never saw him.",
"Such, at any rate, has been its effect.",
"But that which the many think is usually wrong.",
"I always feel that there is something wrong in all they say.",
"The risk would be too great.",
"She has not left her room.",
"She must have heard us but she did not come out of her room.",
"She said nothing and asked no questions.",
"He did not turn.",
"My parents, and those who should care for me, were far away.",
"There can be but a right and a wrong.",
"No man goes to law with him.",
"Perhaps I had no small change.",
"But that was no matter.",
"I do not know the day of the week, or of the month.",
"But then they come into our head.",
"Perhaps they are right.",
"So did his parents.",
"I started out.",
"I found it quite interesting.",
"I remember how I got lost on the first day.",
"I also got lost several times.",
"This then was the general plan.",
"This is all the result, and this all is very little.",
"If he was sometimes wrong, he was often right.",
"The following are some of them.",
"What care will be taken of us, who can tell?",
"I asked him what book he had got.",
"But we were wrong.",
"It was a good plan, too.",
"And mind, not a word of this.",
"It was enough for the town.",
"But he did not so much as turn his head.",
"Help is coming.",
"But why these questions?",
"But what matter?",
"Whatever is right, that is wrong.",
"Never for a day has that thought left my mind for years.",
"He had not a word to say for himself.",
"What is true, at this rate?",
"Is anything right or wrong?",
"What had he lost?",
"Perhaps it will work.",
"He was not free to do so.",
"What does it matter then that we are a few?",
"It is open to women and children.",
"He need not read the reports.",
"I see nothing wrong in it.",
"I asked no more.",
"Many of the parents were present.",
"He asked why we thought so.",
"No time was lost.",
"I have heard of him.",
"He asked himself if she would be at home or away.",
"He had said nothing of his coming.",
"Had she really asked about him?",
"He made his way at once to the office.",
"Perhaps it would not be for long.",
"Come with me to my room.",
"They started off.",
"She was coming back to him.",
"He was man enough to know when to turn back.",
"I was there for a month.",
"She has to make up her mind.",
"I saw his name in the paper.",
"I am here now and we are both free.",
"I have made up my mind what I want in life and I am going to have it.",
"Now watch!",
"With this information we started out to look for him.",
"No time was to be lost.",
"He asked no questions.",
"What we heard, however, must be set down.",
"He may have heard of something.",
"Never heard of or seen the man.",
"They were so much thought of that they were taken great care of.",
"In a little town like this, news is all over the place in a few minutes.",
"The first is from our office.",
"He was thinking hard.",
"It was too late to turn back.",
"She saw him.",
"That was why they were late.",
"Perhaps never to come back!",
"It was still open.",
"Is nothing free?",
"Is the year only lost to me?",
"What was I thinking of?",
"In all his life he had never seen anyone like her!",
"But never mind that.",
"It was his turn.",
"And he had lost her!",
"Everything is lost!",
"Never mind!",
"Here he comes!",
"It is too late now.",
"I have been almost out of my mind for the last few hours.",
"Both, perhaps?",
"I think we should get across the room now.",
"Is it too late?",
"Thus he went on his way.",
"And at last she asked his name.",
"Then he asked the name of the country.",
"Then they saw where they were.",
"Thus they got over.",
"Perhaps they were right.",
"We started.",
"Was I wrong?",
"That does not matter.",
"If we are taken, all is at an end.",
"Night was coming on.",
"I started.",
"They came from outside.",
"Take it himself!",
"They take whatever is given them.",
"In the same room.",
"What was working in his mind.",
"Other reports came in.",
"And we started.",
"What was he thinking of?",
"It was open.",
"It was now my turn to look at him.",
"These were so many questions.",
"He then thought of looking at himself.",
"It probably went down, as he never saw or heard of it more.",
"He asked no questions about him.",
"Whose within?",
"Whose that?",
"I heard it.",
"Went she thus in?",
"Weeks and months went by.",
"The man started for the house.",
"Now a change comes.",
"And he thought of the time, so long ago, when he had asked her the same question.",
"But that does not matter.",
"He was not himself.",
"He was himself again.",
"When he is at work he is all right, or when he is at play, so far as that goes.",
"He saw it all.",
"But I must let him tell his own story in his own way when his turn comes.",
"I never saw anything more of them from that day to this.",
"Perhaps I do.",
"Then the black man started to run.",
"It was full of money.",
"And they are all open to us.",
"The side shows were not doing much business.",
"It did not seem to be night at all.",
"Here is a new hand.",
"Never mind us.",
"No response.",
"The car started up.",
"If he comes, I go!",
"What is the man thinking of!",
"And he started across the room.",
"He was always getting her to come and watch him do it.",
"Also, I saw them before that time.",
"He is making some of the things described in it.",
"This went on for several days without any result.",
"He was still, as if thinking.",
"Yes, heard her.",
"I think I heard that line in a play once.",
"Then he heard nothing more.",
"To be asked to!",
"There is no time to be lost.",
"Never coming back!",
"No matter!",
"She was head on for him.",
"Now it was too late!",
"Another comes.",
"What has taken place, and why has it?",
"Was it too late to start over again?",
"She put out her hand.",
"But he was very trying to deal with.",
"Now he had other business on hand.",
"He would go through with the thing he had started.",
"He had it coming to him.",
"Where was he taking her?",
"She was lost.",
"I was to mind my own business.",
"Later she would watch in her turn.",
"It did not seem likely.",
"The same thought was in the mind of all.",
"She had been lost and was found.",
"What was he thinking?",
"They were by this time in the big family room.",
"She did not know who her parents had been.",
"They were together, perhaps.",
"But he may be late.",
"A matter of business.",
"At last came the end of the first act.",
"I put out my hand and took his.",
"It was the first question she had asked.",
"She will do a good deal for money.",
"I asked.",
"By and by, perhaps.",
"She put it into my hand.",
"Yet, there can be right and wrong expression.",
"Let us work to make men free!",
"She took it in her hand.",
"Turn me back!",
"It was a good team.",
"I will think this matter over.",
"She saw the point.",
"It is not too late.",
"He saw.",
"I am coming with it now.",
"I think there was a great deal to be said for him.",
"At last he makes up his mind.",
"What would be the result?",
"But does the matter end here?",
"Well, there is a great deal to be said for that.",
"They have seen a great deal in their time.",
"What was the result?",
"There is no more to be said about this matter.",
"He saw it now.",
"Perhaps that was the way it had been.",
"Was he not taking her to the city?",
"It might be all over town.",
"Still the story would be all over town.",
"And he saw.",
"He started to go.",
"Above all, he was there, and she could talk to him.",
"And how should she deal?",
"It was a pretty role.",
"The process of making this was new and interesting to me.",
"The result, however, was very far from that.",
"So I made up my mind to try and run away to a free country.",
"What had he heard?",
"In a few minutes!",
"It is now too late.",
"The look was taken, but nothing was seen.",
"So in every matter.",
"I never heard it.",
"He saw nothing.",
"Who could want anything of her so late in the night?",
"What is the matter?",
"There he comes now.",
"Perhaps we, too, could do something for him.",
"We live in town, or almost in.",
"Look at my hand!",
"It would have made it seem more real.",
"I never heard.",
"In a word, he was free!",
"What is wrong?",
"The office would do quite well enough.",
"Not a business matter at all, in fact.",
"The fact is that I am thinking of something else.",
"She saw them at once.",
"Children have no sense of value.",
"I saw her.",
"It is not lost.",
"Do let her tell us what is coming.",
"They were coming back along the side of the house.",
"He would know that she was free.",
"But I never heard of it.",
"It must be late.",
"Instead she asked him to do something for her.",
"Whatever was she doing?",
"Although I am never wrong.",
"I am taking only a little.",
"At first hand, too.",
"He was too late, however.",
"That had been a close call!",
"Perhaps they are!",
"He had never seen anyone like her.",
"Never had done him any wrong, had he?",
"Well, any wrong?",
"Still, perhaps that was the law.",
"She had not heard him for many minutes now.",
"But I know a good deal about her.",
"The business on hand came to nothing.",
"Our job is to watch.",
"I had it all taken down.",
"What national state?",
"He must do it himself, and he is not doing it.",
"If a man goes above him he does not seem to know what to do.",
"Am I to provide for them all?",
"After all, what did it matter?",
"Too low!",
"I will open it!",
"But he was still coming on.",
"The old man had told us this himself.",
"Full and for all.",
"But the days and weeks and months went by.",
"He made up his mind at once.",
"He had heard it all.",
"He did not care to see him now, at any rate.",
"It might be of value to him and it might not be.",
"The risk was too great.",
"He started on again.",
"He would not try that plan again.",
"He was talking to himself.",
"Value of money.",
"I long to take him by the hand.",
"There was a good deal of company in the room.",
"But I may be wrong.",
"He asked, how did the women do?",
"It is so called from its form.",
"They have taken it down.",
"The following days I read here and there.",
"The town is old, and very mean, but has, I think, a market.",
"I asked in what?",
"Perhaps a good job too.",
"Perhaps that was the reason he went.",
"He took out his watch.",
"But she says that whatever I do.",
"I have heard these words, and live.",
"I think so, at any rate.",
"How they open, how they close!",
"She put him in her room.",
"If this matter be ever to be!",
"But then it was in the mind I was in.",
"Yet perhaps he has nothing new to say to me.",
"But then she thought, and asked a question.",
"She is lost.",
"I am free!",
"This he called kind treatment.",
"This was the last he ever heard of him.",
"He has heard once more from his parents.",
"Then they came to the open country again.",
"I have heard them say so.",
"I have no time at present, I am going out of town.",
"I did not mean to do wrong.",
"I seem to remember it when I think very hard.",
"A small matter.",
"I know the town.",
"What wrong have I?",
"Yes, and taken too.",
"Let go his hand!",
"Good, by this hand!",
"And here he comes.",
"Then there it goes.",
"But here comes he and she.",
"Well, never mind.",
"Something must be wrong.",
"My mind was made up not to see her again.",
"They had been once more in the same room.",
"Are they coming?",
"I asked him why he did this.",
"But to come to the very town!",
"They had called him in too late.",
"Was he thinking of going away?",
"She could get no further.",
"But I had never taken human life.",
"So that he might he took him to himself, for help in time of need.",
"He is wrong.",
"Look at it close.",
"What have I been thinking of?",
"And it goes.",
"Perhaps half of them were true.",
"It was almost full night by now.",
"It comes high in the end usually.",
"I saw the whole thing.",
"I may be wrong in what I think.",
"He saw other things too.",
"Perhaps there was nothing to say.",
"They were gonna down me if they could.",
"They read it with care and great interest.",
"Perhaps not.",
"No more was it too late.",
"When we have been wrong, we say nothing.",
"What does it matter what I say!",
"At last he made up his mind.",
"At any rate, I am not a man.",
"The fact is that my interest is of quite recent growth.",
"It would be interesting to know who it was.",
"Quite close to my old house.",
"That is what these people seem to have done.",
"But I have not heard of any such man.",
"This is rather interesting, by the way.",
"I never heard from him again in any way.",
"I say there was no reason whatever.",
"After all, I had lost nothing that I had ever had.",
"This is very interesting.",
"Was I right or was I wrong?",
"See, it comes!",
"Example of parents.",
"Parents should play with their children.",
"The following are a few of them.",
"It was as if he had never heard the word at all.",
"For again he saw himself.",
"Himself, always.",
"So he started.",
"They are sometimes in the right, sometimes in the wrong.",
"But I will go into my matter.",
"Thus it is, and will be!",
"But this does not seem to do the business.",
"That was a month ago.",
"No other work of the time is to be compared with it.",
"But is it not too late?",
"She never saw it as others did.",
"Was it wrong?",
"They are interesting men who have done interesting things.",
"But there was no time to be lost.",
"There can be no question as to the result.",
"But on the other hand, what could we say?",
"Get to house late.",
"I never saw him before in my life.",
"Who can tell what we have in mind when we talk of life?",
"And this would seem to have been the problem for them on that day.",
"The black?",
"And comes he there?",
"She will take no part in it whatever.",
"We still show the very room.",
"It is too late.",
"The night was close and still.",
"Why had he not come himself and asked her if all this were true?",
"Night is coming on.",
"I saw him every day.",
"She had never heard of those children before.",
"What did that matter, however?",
"I never asked him.",
"The evidence would seem to point that way.",
"This should not be saying much, but as things go it is saying a good deal.",
"He will say to himself that he can never find another.",
"I never saw him again.",
"Then they said that perhaps we should like to buy them and take them away with us.",
"Perhaps he was used to it.",
"There are many interesting things to see on the way.",
"His name I never heard.",
"A room!",
"Let them look to it that they do me no wrong.",
"We have read it with much interest.",
"Then there is just another thing which has been on my mind for a long time.",
"He saw himself in things, and not as they were.",
"But still further.",
"My head, too, is not quite what it used to be.",
"Perhaps she will say something to us.",
"Outside nothing had been done to the house for years.",
"There is nothing the matter.",
"But what did it matter?",
"I saw him.",
"But I did not mind.",
"At any rate, I did not get it.",
"And I have found out what was the matter with me.",
"It comes, they know not how.",
"It goes, they know not why.",
"Asked why?",
"For they think that they will be heard for their many words.",
"I saw them again next day.",
"Early and late the work went on.",
"We were days late.",
"All are wrong.",
"Now I am free of it.",
"I saw her see me.",
"It is not like his hand.",
"But we saw it, any way.",
"There is nothing that a man can do that is wrong, is there?",
"Those who came were those I did not want to come, and I saw very few of them.",
"This, I think, will be interesting.",
"She had left the town.",
"It was more than a year and a half since she left the town.",
"He had no more expression than the back of my hand.",
"I have no reason to think she had at that time lost her mind.",
"It is late?",
"At last I made out what a man was saying in the next room.",
"What is my life to be at this rate?",
"This is another thing, and perhaps it is a higher.",
"Is the thing lost?",
"And yet I value them less and less every day.",
"I get lost in it.",
"Is anything interesting known about him?",
"I have a great mind to try.",
"It is interesting to know.",
"Here is a great wrong.",
"No such matter.",
"I am not coming home for another year.",
"I must now turn to a point of business.",
"Come, my mind is looking up.",
"We have had a very interesting business here.",
"They must be very interesting.",
"He goes.",
"She goes.",
"A watch.",
"A head.",
"At present the matter is not so.",
"Of the town there is not much to be said.",
"This, at least, is wrong.",
"Must it be always thus?",
"Yet there is a great deal to be said for this.",
"What should I say when I was asked what I wanted there?",
"The whole matter came to an end.",
"I saw him at once.",
"On going close to him, I saw what the man was doing.",
"What is there wrong about that?",
"I asked what they were saying."],

["I did not understand much of what he said.",
"I did not move.",
"For a while, I knew nothing.",
"Yet now I could hear nothing.",
"Half a century!",
"We never knew who he was.",
"I never could understand why.",
"However, as a rule they went.",
"Every day we expected to hear of his death.",
"To be always what he is this morning?",
"This, I take it, is the work of our new century.",
"This, and many other good things, it is not too much to hope for.",
"We need friends just as we need air.",
"On the other there is some difference.",
"I knew what was coming.",
"So he knew that, after all!",
"He considered.",
"It was all good enough fun to them.",
"It was exactly like that.",
"I knew him too well.",
"Not exactly.",
"I had made up my mind that morning, all at once, to go into the country.",
"All things are on the move!",
"I knew him at once.",
"Therefore, this part of the case was all clear enough.",
"Did I hear it?",
"He knew.",
"Because it took such a lot of tax to put it down.",
"Why not tax that?",
"She did not understand.",
"That made no difference.",
"He knew that.",
"She wanted to hear no more about it.",
"It would make a certain difference to them, she thought.",
"It would take longer.",
"Go out more in the air.",
"How like a woman!",
"She gave it to him.",
"I hope not!",
"At least they would be able to buy food.",
"But what would her mother say?",
"Many gave.",
"They had never seen a white woman before.",
"The men did not like to hear that.",
"She made many friends.",
"They are old friends.",
"They had to stop, too.",
"He does not act like a woman.",
"She did everything she knew to help him.",
"Then I knew it was true.",
"But nothing could stop her.",
"They gave money.",
"She put his body in it.",
"He could read and she needed his help.",
"We do not understand them.",
"But I want them to know many more things so that they can take care of themselves.",
"But still she would not stop working.",
"Here was his hope.",
"People did not understand such a state of things.",
"Stop it!",
"Quite well, I hope?",
"His book, therefore, is full of living interest.",
"It is not clear to me just what changes could be made.",
"Then they lost a game.",
"I am certain I did not.",
"There is something behind it.",
"Mother did everything in her power for him.",
"They had no idea that there were any white men in that part of the country.",
"In this house we are now living, and we hope to make it our home for many years to come.",
"These things are in the future.",
"Who was her mother!",
"Then we went at the game.",
"His friends said he must go, too.",
"What does get into the child!",
"Is it man, woman or child.",
"Where are the white people?",
"An old woman!",
"What was behind?",
"White women!",
"She cut him short.",
"But still he would not understand.",
"They thought it was the sense of that security that made them put off the day.",
"I was a bad child.",
"Hear me.",
"A very common expression.",
"She knew!",
"But he knew.",
"Some other woman has had what I can never have.",
"What else is a woman for?",
"He gave it to her.",
"It is just now that he needs her most.",
"She knew he would.",
"This place was home no longer.",
"So this was all that living came to!",
"Only problems based on these will be real to this child at first.",
"The difference has come from within the children.",
"The important thing to know is the kind of help that should be given, and when and how it is needed.",
"Then in summer it is exactly the other way.",
"To see what the result would be, I gave to him the same amount as to the first.",
"And that made all the difference.",
"No war came.",
"It was the woman, too, who had given me food the night before.",
"I asked him if I could do him any service.",
"I used them, but they gave me no help.",
"We came very close above them, so that I could hear their talk.",
"I do not think I even wanted to hope.",
"Then he gave me the news.",
"I had made good my position.",
"I said I would try, but I was far from certain.",
"Was there any hope for him?",
"But they would not move.",
"But she had always been a kind woman.",
"She was more kind to me than a mother.",
"I feel like a friend.",
"She could not have told, but yet she knew.",
"This is not where I expected to come.",
"I hope though there is something to do.",
"She knew not what to do or what to say.",
"It is to them as if they had lost their child.",
"The words are words that once I knew, and the face I knew.",
"Into the air!",
"What a word to hear!",
"In every new place there is new hope.",
"I knew what he was about to say.",
"He knew that of my own will I would not have done it.",
"My mother!",
"I hope I have always been a just man.",
"I could never be her child to her, any more than she could be a mother to me.",
"And now for the first time I knew why.",
"So I stop short.",
"How know we what difference there may be in them in the future from what they are now?",
"Summer again its course has run.",
"I therefore left them.",
"But what about when our blood got up?",
"But there was much that he did not understand.",
"She cut him short again.",
"Life had left the body which reason had left long before.",
"But was that man living?",
"And what has made this difference?",
"It is now real war.",
"And his mother, what must her state of mind be?",
"And his mother?",
"I am sure my mother can not have any certain information about me.",
"Give me the white.",
"He knew her so well!",
"I expected as much.",
"The talk became general.",
"She will, of course, show it to her mother.",
"Our night will be known in the morning.",
"They could move about.",
"I can face my family.",
"She knew it.",
"All that can be done has been done by his friends.",
"He expected her.",
"We have short time to work in.",
"He did not start, as she expected.",
"They feel not only for themselves but for other people.",
"And yet this woman has children to love her.",
"But that mother did more for that family than all the others put together.",
"I hope so.",
"Yet may this not be, for as my body is great, so is my love.",
"And what future can there be?",
"He knew me.",
"It is no longer what it was.",
"No common man.",
"Now they were out for blood.",
"But when she said good night to him, his face was still set.",
"What man could understand me?",
"She could not play her game.",
"And I had hope.",
"And they knew it.",
"And when he showed up this time it was the same old story.",
"Got me up in the air.",
"The way was clear.",
"It was that woman done it!",
"A woman!",
"Well, we want to hear all about that woman.",
"I knew what he wanted to say, but saw no reason to help him.",
"But even yet I did not understand.",
"Now that it is too late, I understand.",
"He would never see her face again.",
"This was to make them friends.",
"In this way many made their living.",
"He gave part of this to his friends.",
"Maybe it is too big for some of my little friends that will read this book.",
"They asked him where his friends were.",
"She knew how to keep out of the way.",
"She found it great fun.",
"She did not move.",
"Even his own friends had hard work to find him.",
"It made his face black.",
"He did not talk to show off what he knew.",
"That is their way of making friends.",
"He gave it to a friend.",
"He took only what he needed to study.",
"When morning came, he went and got it.",
"His family had to live by the help of his friends.",
"They had not enough food.",
"These made very good food for them.",
"And he wanted to have him get up early in the morning to help with the work.",
"But he did not seem to hear them.",
"She had made all the money she needed.",
"To go a little late is just the article.",
"They may be related in blood.",
"First, look up the word itself.",
"Or take military terms.",
"Small groups of words so related.",
"As a rule she did not say much.",
"He knew the power of love.",
"Now she knew.",
"She knew he wanted her.",
"He knew them well enough.",
"She knew that.",
"I gave it to her.",
"But I could not move.",
"I did not need it longer.",
"It needed nothing more.",
"It was a living group that I saw.",
"The result was just what might have been expected.",
"No work was required.",
"So is the free woman.",
"So does the free woman.",
"This was not as mother used to do.",
"He knew that they would do the same to him.",
"He knew me as a friend of the family and was quite nice to me.",
"But we know what his help will amount to.",
"If I have a thing to say to a man I like to say it to his face.",
"He knew me not, though I called him by name.",
"Without friends or money he could not go very far.",
"I must first see the face.",
"This was to be expected.",
"But I gave no thought to this.",
"But he could say nothing in face of this evidence.",
"I hope not.",
"It gave him an idea.",
"This I say as a friend.",
"I had expected this.",
"The future!",
"She was a woman.",
"I must not keep her longer.",
"What had I expected to find?",
"Was there no way to stop it?",
"I remember every move she made so well.",
"I knew what she did with them.",
"Was it possible that I should find a friend in this man?",
"This was just what I had expected from her.",
"I had small hope, however, that she would so turn.",
"And there we found him, in the same place where we had seen him before, but not in the same position.",
"It was his first music.",
"He knew now what death was.",
"The woman was back there.",
"He knew what it was.",
"She could not understand.",
"Her face was white.",
"It was his last hope.",
"It was big game.",
"But this was summer.",
"Their mother was about to increase the family.",
"It was his friend.",
"They went on until they came to a certain place.",
"The good man gave it to him.",
"She would not move.",
"How could they be expected to understand?",
"He wanted all the world to hear.",
"This is all that is required at the present day.",
"To say that in the past they had never thought of war is to say a thing not true.",
"What would they do without a state of war?",
"He had, therefore, a long talk with her about it.",
"We were not long away from the women after that, for they must hear the great news.",
"I had never known this woman.",
"There must be something behind.",
"I am a woman.",
"Now hear the reason.",
"My child.",
"My child!",
"I have lost my child, my own!",
"Out, woman!",
"But they have a language.",
"Why music?",
"Our food is good.",
"But he knew no more than I.",
"It makes a difference.",
"But who was the woman?",
"Of that I was certain.",
"But what difference does it make?",
"I would go to him and face him.",
"We go to hear her.",
"He is all language.",
"But the music still went on.",
"Then the order came to move on.",
"They thought the war was over and they were going home.",
"He did not understand them.",
"But not of the living.",
"They knew me.",
"I have lost my friends.",
"I have lost my position.",
"Of all the people I had expected to see that morning he was the last.",
"The morning is getting on.",
"Yet I can understand.",
"At least we were living life.",
"We have always known when the game was up.",
"Not that it has made much difference.",
"I knew that nothing would stop me.",
"I knew the place.",
"So he was coming, as I knew he would.",
"But she did not move.",
"And then, half to himself he added.",
"Was it ever possible to understand him?",
"He expected no such question.",
"We became friends.",
"We all know where the body was found.",
"He knew when to stop.",
"Why not face the music at once?",
"He needs it.",
"Therefore, they made that way at once.",
"High and low, all made fun of him.",
"The children were very good friends.",
"His first and his last thought was always the child.",
"The child must live!",
"What a pretty little white hand it is!",
"War was still the business of the world.",
"I say not that all things are clear to them.",
"That was bad, but there was more behind.",
"For that is exactly what man does not.",
"So, we may believe, it needed to be.",
"Yes, my friends.",
"For what is growth, but a thing making itself?",
"No, it is not, my friends.",
"But it need not be so, friends.",
"And he has good hope for them.",
"This is very important, my friends.",
"He has not the same rule for all men.",
"Think, think, my friends.",
"But how is it that they are ever needed?",
"How is that, my friends?",
"He then asked for some food.",
"They had all the help they needed.",
"I believe she is without friends or money.",
"Our friends have been very good.",
"Still, she was a good mother.",
"I hope she is well.",
"Come and talk with him, and hear what he says first.",
"And think about common things more.",
"I never knew him give anything away in my life.",
"By this time I hope it is all over with him.",
"I like to see my friends here.",
"We did not stop here long.",
"My friend knew the old woman.",
"My friend asked how he was getting on.",
"The woman was quite right.",
"What is now the amount?",
"Now he was certain.",
"Now I understand.",
"Then I gave it to him.",
"It is special.",
"But I can no longer look the other way.",
"Today was a special day.",
"She always knew he was there.",
"She knew.",
"It is such a special day.",
"What is now future will be present, as what is already past once was.",
"Among them it did good service.",
"Others could understand it.",
"She gave me this.",
"He is my page.",
"But now the music was always in the way.",
"Good morning!",
"The face which he could not see was not quite the face of a good woman.",
"He either knew it before or did not take much interest in the matter.",
"It does itself.",
"He could not see her face.",
"He has no friends there.",
"So much for the future.",
"There was something which she did not understand.",
"Now, who found the body?",
"They had nothing in common.",
"There is something in the air.",
"The man did not understand.",
"They would never have got like this by themselves.",
"I knew as much then as I do now.",
"Half of them did not understand him.",
"Why blood?",
"Of blood!",
"Of course, I came here for fun, and I have had some, though not just the sort I expected.",
"He find me other friends, though I could do nothing at all for them to pay them back.",
"So mother asked me to look her up.",
"But that made little real difference.",
"It does not want our sort of culture.",
"No need of any other game in that company at such a time.",
"The woman?",
"I do not know what the word means, but my mother would know how to use it and get effects.",
"His mother!",
"Average cost.",
"This stock should be made the day before it is required for use.",
"Make this also the day before it is required.",
"This will take out the air.",
"No, they stop!",
"Hear him.",
"She should not have said that, mother, should she?",
"That is what the woman said, and I believe her.",
"We have always been good friends.",
"I never had a friend like her in all my life.",
"His country required his services.",
"This is war.",
"At last it was cut out.",
"It makes no difference.",
"I hope it will never end until that time.",
"She left no child.",
"As to what there was against the house itself she could not tell.",
"Well, I hope?",
"This must stop!",
"He could only see and hear.",
"After a time we came to a place that I knew.",
"There is hope yet!",
"His rule did not last long.",
"It has found a new world in the air.",
"Come then, my friend!",
"Friend to my life!",
"I hear the call of years!",
"And will I see his face again?",
"Still, there was a difference.",
"He is at war both with them and his country.",
"It was not at all certain.",
"I knew that all day.",
"This is no longer so.",
"But his last words showed that he was not so sure of that.",
"Down with war!",
"Each knew not the other, because he knew not himself.",
"What could be behind them?",
"And she gave up trying.",
"I gave him up.",
"He expected anything.",
"He had seen it so often that he knew it had to do with money.",
"But he did not stop.",
"He saw a white face.",
"There was no hope.",
"I hope he does go there.",
"That part was fun.",
"Living in that room was over for him.",
"He was going away to war.",
"So let him go to war.",
"But no longer.",
"She knew it and did not care.",
"And, therefore, if he went at all he was lost.",
"She would never have a child.",
"Let these men face me.",
"She knew then that she had the power to keep him and she could use it, but she must not do so.",
"I never will understand that.",
"His face was white.",
"She knew then, as never before, that she had the power to keep him at her side.",
"But she was a woman.",
"I make no friends.",
"I see and feel and hear without thinking.",
"We gave him up.",
"To find itself!",
"I was only in fun.",
"He had no hope.",
"It was not what he had expected.",
"War of men!",
"That was certain.",
"Some day perhaps it will all come clear.",
"But I saw the wrong of war.",
"If I have lost some friends by death, I have not lost all.",
"No hope of getting off.",
"Finally they came to terms.",
"Yet I knew it to be real.",
"And that other body?",
"It is well we understand each other.",
"I could read the working of his mind in his face.",
"Who could the woman be?",
"Then I knew.",
"There is, after all, little which needs to be said.",
"I want to face the music, and have it over with.",
"This point, therefore.",
"He would see to it that it took no great amount of time.",
"Further, he knew that he had seen it before and where he had seen it.",
"What, exactly, did she feel?",
"If they knew they would have been on their way already.",
"Thus, then, they knew something.",
"And as he had more than half expected, he found nothing.",
"He must try to get game of some sort.",
"And she knew.",
"Full morning.",
"Now, move!",
"No, he could not understand that.",
"He could not understand.",
"It does not therefore move itself.",
"But they so understand and so use.",
"He was having fun too.",
"He needed her.",
"She really knew.",
"What difference would that make?",
"I would have thought even a woman could do it.",
"Up to the present, the past has taken care of the future.",
"Something of this must have shown in his face.",
"He knew that was why she came.",
"I understand.",
"I knew what I should do.",
"He should hear all of the story.",
"He knew he was going to do whatever she said.",
"I hear them still!",
"It must be great fun.",
"What should we do to help these members of our common family, who are not as well off as we are?",
"It makes no difference to me.",
"They had to get them at the same time every morning.",
"But when she saw me what a face she made.",
"I would have them work, and work hard, too, but when their work was over, I would let them have some fun.",
"Hope not.",
"My friends, that was the first time in his life that he ever found himself in really good company.",
"Will she stop?",
"That is the rule in that region.",
"We do not exactly know.",
"Let us be clear if we can.",
"After a time the other showed up.",
"It was not needed.",
"So the morning found them.",
"And, now, just help me with this list.",
"To this day they have no common name.",
"That seems to be only the common sense of the matter.",
"It was perhaps to be expected.",
"This war is that.",
"His service is the service of man.",
"The difference to me.",
"Yet they had much in common.",
"Look at her face.",
"Talk about fun!",
"Was I up in the air?",
"By that I knew they had heard everything we said.",
"I knew it was just like him to do that.",
"All right then, what became of it?",
"Then I saw something white on it.",
"It was a face.",
"I knew now that he must be all right, because I heard him move.",
"She asked not the company of her friend.",
"The matter in short is this.",
"I hope to be called to the team.",
"Then the game went on.",
"The game was over.",
"The game was over at last.",
"All the fun they get.",
"Still, what had he expected?",
"The game went on as before.",
"But will that stop him?",
"And good blood, too.",
"She wanted to see her mother.",
"The child would not understand anything.",
"She would love his mother.",
"Her mother could not understand it.",
"And then there was music and talk.",
"Why, child!",
"I hope it is so.",
"Now, my friends, I do not believe this.",
"But what a difference!",
"That is exactly what I do not mean.",
"We are not certain.",
"Every child can understand, every child can feel with it.",
"He could turn it into blood.",
"They are the same, my friends.",
"Not so, my friends!",
"Clear as day!",
"To him everything that he did was as clear as day.",
"But, after all, that was so old a story that it made little difference.",
"Among other things he showed me what a friend might be.",
"It was possible that there might be in him a story as big as his body.",
"He did not know exactly what he said.",
"He knew what would come.",
"I understand now.",
"He had been expected, then.",
"Would they never stop?",
"He had never had so much fun before in all his life.",
"They had found themselves together once before in that same room.",
"She is so like her mother.",
"What will become of me with this child?",
"And her child, just look at it!",
"They will look very well behind me.",
"It was war.",
"He no longer knew.",
"Was not that blood common to them both?",
"He did not yet understand.",
"A child?",
"I will go to see that man in the morning.",
"No more room, no more food!",
"He had been living there so many years.",
"What he knew?",
"Why, he knew everything.",
"But he knew them well.",
"I knew that they did not get on well together.",
"War between us!",
"That is certain.",
"What fun!",
"If needs, I would.",
"And what of this, my friend?",
"Come, help, away with my friend.",
"No longer love, no longer let me live.",
"What needs these words?",
"So is my will, and therefore even so.",
"My game!",
"What game?",
"Mother, good mother, hear me!",
"She went in, mother.",
"Come, let us hear him.",
"Turn, woman?",
"Go in, good friend.",
"But hear me.",
"She is not living with me.",
"I knew him and he knew me.",
"We can have some fun with it yet, though.",
"The second week was much longer than the first.",
"I knew what it was, right away.",
"Let us look at the position.",
"That is no longer the case.",
"So it also became law.",
"The man is still living.",
"She was my friend once.",
"And he knew his own mind.",
"It is great fun.",
"I am behind the times.",
"She gave no further thought to him.",
"She knew her own mind, however.",
"And she knew her own mind.",
"I move about.",
"I am not certain but he is right.",
"He knew not what to think.",
"It has come to be a woman, before it was a child.",
"We have been long looking for such a friend.",
"I was a woman of the world.",
"But that makes no difference.",
"I give the words exactly.",
"What did the mother country do for them?",
"And then, there was always time for fun.",
"They will love their friends.",
"However, there is some difference.",
"They have no friends.",
"Long may he live to hear and to feel it!",
"We had a very good morning.",
"Whether he himself was present is not clear.",
"I never had such a friend before.",
"This time he had more friends.",
"I saw at once that this might not any longer be known.",
"I knew that.",
"Once I thought the game was up and all was lost.",
"I must get that, first thing in the morning.",
"But my business was with the child.",
"What became of his money after his death?",
"Who was this woman?",
"She would try, anyway.",
"Would they like to hear the story?",
"I believe, however, through his mother.",
"Woman must do it, and not man.",
"What was to be expected?",
"I knew all the while!",
"Be a new man, once and for all, my friend.",
"I knew it would come.",
"At the same time I must make my position clear.",
"This question has been asked again by some friends in another form.",
"And the more we do, the more we find that much more must be done than we have expected.",
"We are at war with nothing that is good in the world.",
"They could do everything except take my life.",
"A military man is what the country needs.",
"He was an old man when I took him into my service.",
"Now this was exactly what he should not have said.",
"My country needs my services.",
"Let me hear them.",
"And the story itself.",
"She was in the same position that I was.",
"She gave a little start.",
"She was just as he had expected to find her.",
"It was certain that she saw him then for the first time.",
"I must hear all about it.",
"Understand that.",
"Power observed.",
"If ever a man found a woman at the right time, I did.",
"Except for that he is quite well.",
"I saw his face just under the water.",
"Let us hope so.",
"The following morning we started early.",
"It did make a difference to the child.",
"I knew.",
"All the same, something is due.",
"The community can deal with them.",
"Would she understand?",
"Not a word, child.",
"I read it in her face.",
"And then and there he knew almost everything.",
"Nothing can stop them then.",
"For there was nothing whatever on the body.",
"The fact is, I knew next to nothing.",
"I knew it would find him.",
"That was all he knew.",
"We want to make for a point clear between them.",
"I had my own game to play.",
"She needs a change.",
"He knew the place.",
"She did not stop.",
"Now make fun of me!",
"What difference do we find?",
"Still they are in themselves true.",
"My mother did not seem to want me to talk about them.",
"My mother said nothing.",
"The next morning came, and my mother called me to her side.",
"I need food.",
"This gave me much to think about.",
"Found everything right, I hope?",
"Tell me if it is, and I will not do so for the future.",
"I heard this morning.",
"There was no hope for him.",
"We knew then what was the matter with him.",
"I do not understand.",
"I do not hear very often from him.",
"And yet I can understand.",
"I long to hear!",
"So when the morning was come, they would know how he did.",
"So they gave back, and came no further.",
"We will hear the whole.",
"Hear me not!",
"Why should I be considered man?",
"We have not been able to clear up this point.",
"There is yet time to stop.",
"He knew me at once, and came up to me.",
"Not too early in the morning.",
"She knew him.",
"Do not hope.",
"He knew how to set about the work.",
"There he saw his first service.",
"Hope at the present time was on our side.",
"What was taking place I have just related.",
"I asked him if he thought his friends were going to come.",
"It was the short man.",
"They could no longer see anything.",
"He had friends there.",
"This woman was a man.",
"He knew him very well.",
"The child should be much in the open air.",
"A certain care has been taken of them.",
"Their services were no longer wanted.",
"This they themselves had done.",
"What order needs?",
"Such another face I never knew.",
"I understand her not.",
"My child?",
"And here she woman.",
"He would interest himself in the music.",
"He could not understand it.",
"But only his body is with them.",
"It is almost morning.",
"What sort of a woman she was I do not know.",
"Yes, we understand.",
"It gave him life once more.",
"I have read often about a mother and a child.",
"But there was death in the air.",
"It was just what was needed.",
"Blood will tell.",
"It was low and mean, he knew, but that made no difference.",
"I knew them all, and that was all I knew of them.",
"I knew once more where he was.",
"There is usually a run on the list on that day.",
"But it was not exactly yet.",
"For this reason the case of each individual should be considered by itself.",
"More than ever, we needed a home of our own.",
"It was no longer there.",
"I knew it!",
"It was a city in itself.",
"He could not stop them.",
"Let me understand.",
"Then he gave a great start.",
"If I had not been certain before, I was certain then!",
"We have heard, we hear it so often!",
"I knew at once that we were taken.",
"He could no longer hear the car.",
"Had she been very particular in his case?",
"No woman was with them.",
"How game she had been!",
"Was there another way up from behind?",
"They knew when they had had enough.",
"The white man took it.",
"He gave it.",
"Of course that does make a difference.",
"He knew when he had said enough.",
"If he were a friend he would lead the way.",
"He knew what he wanted.",
"She was as a child to him.",
"They had no food.",
"What he knew was his own business.",
"In themselves they were, he knew, of little value.",
"He knew about such things.",
"That was all she knew.",
"I must hear what they had to say to each other.",
"And I knew she would keep her word.",
"It was true, I knew.",
"But after that my part gave me no more time to think.",
"And my only hope was that I might be right.",
"I have never expected anything from her, as I have from others.",
"It was all over, then, and no more hope.",
"This he did, but the man did not move.",
"Could it be that I was to hear, now?",
"But the story did not exactly end there.",
"They saw only the fact that she was a child.",
"This is just a human child.",
"Maybe friend know of that, though.",
"Much nice, friends are.",
"I knew that he was right.",
"It was a home run and the game was over.",
"Not even she knew why he let her do it.",
"He knew it.",
"But we may have hope.",
"And being a man of common sense, he thought good to know something of what he was doing.",
"Her face was another face.",
"Free as the air.",
"She had wanted she knew not what.",
"And where did he really hope to get?",
"It was hard to get used to being away from my mother.",
"However, the day came and all the family went except me.",
"The mother would again see her child.",
"This work was always done in summer.",
"I knew not what to do.",
"We knew not what was to be done with us.",
"So, early in the morning, we set out.",
"I never heard of any of the children, and knew nothing as to what had become of them.",
"What do we know about him, anyway?",
"I knew I was right about those people.",
"Hope to find more, before last day come.",
"Then he found the language he wanted.",
"Summer come, in his place.",
"What friends had she, if these were not her friends?",
"So the last day of summer came.",
"They made everything clear in a short time.",
"She knew her new friends if they would only believe her.",
"This is the same, with a difference.",
"From her mother she had had no word.",
"If her friends knew of it they did not care.",
"She left next morning.",
"I knew that it was the only way.",
"It is not so clear.",
"I quite understand.",
"This time under the body of the car.",
"He is coming with me this morning.",
"I no longer look back.",
"They are so common.",
"In face of the whole town.",
"But how is mother?",
"She did not seem to hear.",
"I had to, anyway.",
"Was it possible that she was a child still?",
"She would never understand.",
"At any rate it was morning.",
"It must be late, he knew.",
"But he could not question the child.",
"I could hear her talking.",
"But she had not expected any.",
"Exactly what I thought.",
"Would the woman never go!",
"But mother will probably need a lot of help.",
"It made no difference.",
"Nothing in particular.",
"Yet they knew that she did.",
"There would be no fun in it.",
"She already knew the end.",
"I never saw a man look more like living.",
"The few people who were about down here that morning, and who saw him, said that he was looking about from side to side.",
"I had not found him so during the years we had been associated.",
"I was certain that that could not be done.",
"But my time was now getting short.",
"Finally, however, they would run off.",
"Article I.",
"Why had they not shown themselves?",
"This time he knew that he was done.",
"It was what he might have expected.",
"Come back to me, mother!",
"My mother, come back to me!",
"But there was something more, and more important than all this, to be considered.",
"Everything was working now exactly according to his plan.",
"He had always wanted a mother, ever since he could remember.",
"How could he hope it?",
"He had not quite expected this.",
"He was the same child.",
"He left no friends behind him there.",
"He could not quite understand it.",
"In the open air!",
"See that he has everything he needs.",
"There was not much, however, for them to hear.",
"Only he knew they were coming.",
"He took me short at once.",
"I have seen a new region.",
"And his mother.",
"I knew something was wrong.",
"I must remember my position.",
"Perhaps only a mother would really understand.",
"I am his mother.",
"So, of course, we understand each other.",
"We are then able to say that we hear.",
"These are the things that move me.",
"How was it possible to make such a woman understand?",
"Now he had much time to understand it all!",
"And would she understand some day?",
"How was it possible to make her understand!",
"What a difference between men in power of face!",
"Men and women are his game.",
"And that was just the way mother took everything.",
"So with the child.",
"His child, too, said nothing of that.",
"I hope so, at least.",
"Finally he got lost.",
"This my man knew, but said nothing.",
"Good order observed in her house.",
"I have well considered every thing.",
"Treatment I gave him!",
"Such a war in my mind had I never known.",
"The new mother had said so.",
"The old woman was talking on, but he heard no more.",
"And that was the end of everything until morning.",
"Of course they knew she would come back, all in her good time.",
"That is what mother did when she came before.",
"But the children did not stop to look at her.",
"Even mother has never seen them.",
"But they were not left long to themselves.",
"And I have a friend across there who will help us.",
"And it was while his mother was away from home too.",
"But here there was no such hope.",
"She knew that it was to be so.",
"Now this is the difference.",
"A difference?",
"And something of themselves was told.",
"But I was taking a short cut.",
"How white I am!",
"It seems like something personal.",
"Her mother was not at home, and would not be until night.",
"Come in, good woman.",
"Once more hear me!",
"But what became of them?",
"A friend.",
"My only child.",
"She was individual.",
"Again he knew not what to say.",
"The old woman observed this.",
"On the way to her room she had to stop to think where she was.",
"All this, of course, I did not understand at the time.",
"She did not get up the next morning.",
"Let the future take care of itself.",
"This thing was certain.",
"He knew the top was coming off.",
"I never did know when to stop.",
"But there was a difference.",
"But they did not move along.",
"Every man is needed.",
"And he knew why.",
"No living with him.",
"Nothing ever will stop me.",
"Only for his friends.",
"So did several other men he knew.",
"Whatever it was he did not hear it again.",
"At first she did not understand.",
"Get a move on.",
"And then they knew as much about it all as there was any need to know.",
"So in a little while they became great friends.",
"Even in war.",
"That is what I hope for.",
"I could not hear what he said.",
"And if he knew so much, what more might he not know!",
"Make this very clear to the men.",
"I considered whether I should tell.",
"But there are some other points that are very significant.",
"And then the matter itself was full of interest.",
"We may be pretty certain that he will do nothing of the kind.",
"That is, for a living man.",
"At least, so I understand.",
"It was all clear enough so far.",
"By the way, what is our position in the matter?",
"What a difference time makes!",
"First food given.",
"Health of the mother.",
"Position of the head.",
"Why all this difference?",
"Of the former, there may, be hope.",
"We should stop from time to time, during the process.",
"But let us hear his own words.",
"There is also, during the summer, another reason.",
"And what is to be expected as the result?",
"And what else could be expected as the result?",
"The same face, the very same.",
"Clear away!",
"My little, little child!",
"Why show me this, if I am past all hope?",
"But he was early at the office next morning.",
"At the end of a week they had lost all hope.",
"But about my friend here.",
"But that was all the difference.",
"It is enough, he makes it his general rule.",
"We have a common form for all those things.",
"He related whatever he had seen.",
"I could not face him.",
"We stop to look at it.",
"No hope of it!",
"The fact is clear.",
"It is not very clear to himself.",
"The use of such language was common.",
"I hope they do, I am sure.",
"Such fun!",
"I see it exactly.",
"Black or white, they will all think so.",
"That was the first that he knew of it.",
"That is clear, I hope?",
"Child of my parents!",
"But what exactly do we mean by this?",
"They are face to face.",
"If there was any thing to be told, she would like to hear it.",
"He had come to her, she knew not how.",
"Such a service!",
"I did not understand it.",
"But it must be done, she knew.",
"She knew men so well.",
"Men had been her special study.",
"She was his only hope.",
"Her white face was set.",
"I will not have him on any other terms.",
"Now she could understand them.",
"What was she about to hear?",
"Hear me, then.",
"I never hear them.",
"Would she not understand him?",
"And yet I thought that pretty face was very true.",
"He took the child with him.",
"Next day, however, all had become normal again.",
"There was something of the child about him to the last.",
"If that were so I should not have related it, even if it were true.",
"The figure did not move.",
"She had made friends with the women too.",
"I do not quite understand.",
"It was all due to her, then.",
"He never knew himself.",
"That was because they could not see it any longer.",
"Exactly that.",
"Of course, this is no more than is to be expected.",
"Everything is related.",
"Death was common.",
"So he came and took away his body.",
"And he gave him to his mother.",
"But hope that is seen is not hope.",
"Women are so made, I was such a woman at any rate.",
"I was the first woman on his back.",
"Never a hope.",
"Of that, even now, can I understand not the half.",
"I knew everything.",
"But above all, music.",
"Let there be music.",
"Therefore I have not made this thought.",
"It is of old time before me, and therefore it is true.",
"The drug had cost too much.",
"It was the woman.",
"I knew it was due.",
"Understand me.",
"Blood of my blood was she.",
"They are not seen when they are most required.",
"I have seen a woman.",
"I must after him, and cut his story short!",
"I will watch over him so far as he will let me, and do all I may for his child.",
"They are real, clear, living work.",
"But it has points.",
"I hope, however, this will go right.",
"If we could only understand what she says!",
"Let us hope not.",
"So there is hope.",
"I have a particular use for it.",
"Hope all well.",
"But friends could go, and I could come in summer, so I should not be quite cut off.",
"He knew what he was saying.",
"It seems clear to me.",
"I hope may do me.",
"Can that be the difference?",
"A cut.",
"He gave.",
"To get with child.",
"To hear.",
"A child.",
"I know no more than a child.",
"What does she do for a living?",
"What became of her?",
"This I could not understand.",
"I gave him money for a saw, and told him of a place where he could find work.",
"There were not many people in the market itself.",
"I asked the woman who she was.",
"This is what my friend told me."],

["We now take leave of their language.",
"What had happened?",
"I could only guess at what had happened.",
"Then, I turned to run.",
"It was gone.",
"I turned, and went down to my study.",
"It seemed to be the only course to take.",
"I could make only a guess at what had happened.",
"Then it was gone.",
"What can have happened?",
"It was so near.",
"Thus, for a long space, things were.",
"Was she about to leave me?",
"Would she have to go, as she had gone before?",
"Were they one and the same?",
"The day has come and gone, and it is night again.",
"After that, I left him alone.",
"No one ever went near it, either by day or night.",
"One saw him very little.",
"Her answer might have been interesting.",
"I thought our house was pretty well provided for.",
"However, nothing happened.",
"Do not let the hour go by!",
"It is true that the conditions of work are more trying than they have usually been.",
"A word may mean one thing by itself.",
"Of what quality?",
"But not so with the works of man.",
"Certainly, this was so.",
"There were some that did not please me so well.",
"My father took a turn up and down the room, thinking.",
"That is all gone.",
"No answer.",
"No one turned in that night.",
"They moved away, still talking.",
"It looked good.",
"I looked her over.",
"He began to answer back.",
"He looked me over.",
"Same answer.",
"I do not see it myself.",
"We made good time, but for a long while nothing happened.",
"I looked up.",
"We could see his light now in one part of her, now in the other.",
"Certainly the men never knew how to take him.",
"He looked at me.",
"He left soon after.",
"They looked at each other.",
"It seemed hours.",
"Once I looked up.",
"Whatever happened, I must have water.",
"Seemed to be coming right for us.",
"But inside it seemed to open out.",
"But one thing I do.",
"Nothing happened.",
"In another hour he came out.",
"Almost from the first I was alone.",
"A light, please.",
"Sometimes I would try to get him before he was quite gone.",
"I cannot remember.",
"Yes, I thought I was gone that time.",
"But they are all gone now.",
"Will keep for one week.",
"We are many, and together we will be strong.",
"Now, what is the cause?",
"As for the rest of the paper, I knew that there was nothing to interest me there.",
"No one more than another.",
"He did not ask what it was for.",
"But he found this difficult.",
"All gone?",
"He wrote a will of his own.",
"So do I, but not for that alone.",
"How soon, how very soon, they must part from each other!",
"I did not want my husband to live after me.",
"I cannot quite say.",
"Her end was very near.",
"The subject did not interest me in the least.",
"It had started half an hour before.",
"But we near the end.",
"This, then, was why her husband came home so many times in the day.",
"So with all the rest of my people.",
"One gets used to a name.",
"And father.",
"They were nearly the last.",
"He looked at it for some time.",
"It would please her so much!",
"He began looking for it.",
"Then he turned to his mother.",
"He looked at her.",
"I mean the last time alone.",
"It would be kind to ask me.",
"There was no answer.",
"And not only in one way, but in every way.",
"Soon they would be going away to some summer place with the children.",
"How far had it gone?",
"She had turned her face.",
"It was a case for action.",
"She looked a question.",
"She moved away.",
"Please believe me.",
"Come and see me soon, and tell me the result.",
"She never moved without him.",
"Yes, please.",
"She cannot live without me.",
"I have made my own decision.",
"She now began to work full time.",
"Please let me try.",
"No one will have anything to do with her.",
"He was happy.",
"He is happy.",
"Soon the year would be over.",
"But weeks and months went by and nothing happened.",
"She looked around.",
"They did not like to hear that their ways were wrong.",
"But she was not alone.",
"Still no one came.",
"He was very near death.",
"The people were very happy.",
"He is the only one who can make me well.",
"They turned around and once more started for home.",
"They said that they knew the old ways were bad.",
"But it was one man who did it.",
"This time there was no one to call her back.",
"The answer was no.",
"But life was not easy.",
"She did not want to take life easy.",
"Here she began her work.",
"Soon the answer came back!",
"This is my wife.",
"This was hard and difficult work.",
"The answer did not come and did not come.",
"I can find food for myself and the children.",
"She looked out of her house.",
"If there had been someone to take her place, she would have gone home for a rest.",
"Of course the note was read.",
"It was myself.",
"I play a little myself.",
"There is now not one thing I value in the world.",
"His life there was certainly not hard or trying.",
"We was happy then.",
"It takes a little time.",
"I done it myself.",
"He moved on.",
"Leave or take.",
"Like his father before him.",
"This went on for nearly a month, but still no result.",
"Off she certainly was.",
"One of their own class he certainly was not.",
"I was one of the last to come away.",
"Perhaps one of the men did.",
"But one can never tell.",
"And now please do not think any more of it.",
"Let the man alone.",
"In an hour we were under way.",
"He had got an hour and a half the start of us.",
"They then turned back, and began to cut up their game.",
"Between the lines may be read the history of his own love.",
"And I am happy now.",
"But stay!",
"Yet stay!",
"I myself hear it now.",
"Who was her father?",
"Man needs rest.",
"Always have a policy.",
"I tried it once.",
"And there was no one to care.",
"She was all alone!",
"He has found it takes the place of most things.",
"That was just like her father!",
"He looked at his watch.",
"No one would care.",
"Everybody does.",
"My father is out of his mind.",
"He put his heart into whatever he did.",
"Only half an hour!",
"No one knew just how it happened.",
"Only one other had ever given it to her before, in the long ago.",
"He was alone.",
"One never knew.",
"A great light was in his face.",
"When he came to get his answer, she would know.",
"He had come to a decision at last.",
"He looked like an old man.",
"She looked up.",
"They were quite near now.",
"Everybody was talking at once.",
"Please take.",
"The cause was lost.",
"He was nearly up to them now.",
"They looked at each other, and then away.",
"Still no answer.",
"They did not stay long.",
"No one.",
"They looked at each other with the same thought.",
"He looked up.",
"No need to ask.",
"This was not the first time such a thing had happened.",
"It was gone!",
"Stay here!",
"Some men behind them began to run.",
"The water began to fall.",
"He was only one.",
"It had all happened in the night.",
"As the woman came out he looked in to make certain.",
"The answer came from one in the group.",
"Looked good to him.",
"Nothing happened for a long time.",
"They all looked up.",
"Very fine!",
"Please me!",
"For that let me alone.",
"He can show him too soon, it may be.",
"I think I cannot.",
"Let me alone.",
"The question was a nice one.",
"She happened, even now, not to be looking at him.",
"Her husband was reading the paper.",
"She looked up from her reading.",
"All that seemed very long ago.",
"Everything that happened seemed to have happened before.",
"She was happy now.",
"Very long ago that seemed now.",
"And so would I, little wife.",
"I tried to.",
"What was the reason for this binding of things together?",
"Then we began to play house.",
"How, then, can we provide for their experience of this side of life?",
"Everybody here seems to be taking in enough food to do them a couple of years.",
"This, I found, would be difficult to do.",
"But he might still get through alone without it.",
"Her case was not nearly so hard as many another.",
"Then he described just what had happened.",
"Once I looked back, but she had no further interest in me.",
"I saw no light for myself in the business.",
"But it seemed he knew how to run.",
"But one thing I know.",
"This did not please the other.",
"No one moved.",
"There we looked back.",
"I will go myself.",
"Most likely I did myself some wrong.",
"He looked me very full in the face.",
"I saw that the end was very near.",
"And then and there began another campaign.",
"There seemed no reason or need for it.",
"Such a thing cannot be done an hour too soon.",
"She could not remember how time went, or that there was any difference between one day and another.",
"Why did she bring her up so if she did not mean to provide for her?",
"Some one!",
"I am sure there is some one in the next room.",
"But the woman never moved.",
"Why not that as well as all the rest?",
"I can say that for myself.",
"There are other ways.",
"I do myself.",
"We are not all happy.",
"I was so myself.",
"We could not bring them back their child.",
"It seemed to me that I could not hear myself think.",
"It might have been an hour, it might have been a year, I cannot tell.",
"But on that subject he said no more.",
"There are a number of fine things to be seen here.",
"Once I gave myself up for lost.",
"How, I said to myself, could such things be?",
"But if one has found it, so may I.",
"They cannot think or feel.",
"And how long I did so I cannot tell.",
"The day seemed to me a very long one.",
"I left him as soon as I could.",
"Man, take heart!",
"I cannot see through it.",
"No need to ask what they were.",
"Had happened?",
"Nothing had happened.",
"I come not of myself.",
"I cannot, if I would.",
"I made no answer.",
"But, father, understand!",
"That was the one thing he had not thought of.",
"And why cannot they do so?",
"Let alone!",
"But by the time he got there he was gone.",
"When we are gone, who will to them be good?",
"What the cause?",
"Now to its close this year is near.",
"All hope is gone.",
"How long back the former age was we cannot tell.",
"She is gone!",
"But he soon had to put this idea from him.",
"She looked up at him.",
"He turned it up.",
"Then he looked at his watch.",
"Is attention required?",
"Any one of them is of great interest.",
"Go home and rest.",
"But take heart.",
"Finally he wrote.",
"Then she turned to the local page.",
"We may see our way out soon.",
"He looked at the man.",
"Each one remember his number.",
"However, that is for future action.",
"He is not alone.",
"Alone again.",
"I can not stay here.",
"Every one is on the make.",
"Her father!",
"Where could her father be?",
"She did not ask him where he was going.",
"Of course the same is true of the wife.",
"Not one word on the other side!",
"Someone has well said that without a model husband there can be no model wife.",
"Each will be free and leave the others so.",
"Good people, but a different point of view.",
"I will answer them together.",
"One thing at a time!",
"Takes a hand to do that sort of work.",
"Her father?",
"But I could not go myself.",
"There was only one possible.",
"And when the need for a man came I turned to him.",
"Therefore she made no answer.",
"It was one big room.",
"She did not answer.",
"No idea how much living costs up here.",
"Just put this down as one of them.",
"But the present question is not one of money.",
"The subject was a real one.",
"She turned, and without a word came back to him.",
"Then he was gone.",
"Only one person in the world.",
"We began to talk.",
"I looked in on her a little while ago.",
"She turned white when she saw me.",
"It may be that my men will not agree with me.",
"He made no answer.",
"I tried to let her go.",
"One thing was now clear.",
"I only looked at him.",
"Then he turned and looked at us.",
"That was a trying half hour.",
"This time, he was not alone.",
"Only one thing had been moved.",
"Then I looked at him again.",
"But there is one great difference.",
"He was good enough to agree.",
"It was easy enough.",
"She now began to hope that he would come.",
"Up there they were happy.",
"I feel sure that him and me would get on together fine.",
"She must try for the right note.",
"They pay more attention to a man person.",
"But he had not the heart to turn back to either.",
"One thing she must tell him.",
"Set and rest.",
"She knew them all by heart.",
"Some people came to one part of the country.",
"At last they turned back.",
"What little money he got he used to buy books with.",
"He read good books.",
"They did not hit the white men.",
"He hit hard, now on this side, and now on that.",
"They wanted to see a man that was good to everybody.",
"He got a large house built for some of them to stay in.",
"Then she turned and went back again.",
"The father went out to see how well he was doing his work.",
"Here he worked away all day long.",
"But where had they gone?",
"He turned this way and that.",
"They could not tell which way he had gone.",
"He heard some one coming.",
"Some went in one way, some another.",
"But, now that they had got away, they looked back.",
"For most of that time they did not see any white men but their own party.",
"One morning he came to school late.",
"They turned to leave the room.",
"That was almost enough for his books.",
"They wanted to go to college.",
"Think how happy they were!",
"And then they tried again.",
"At last they both tried at once.",
"Then he would read other books.",
"His father did not want him to read too late.",
"All day he worked at his type.",
"Day after day he worked, and said nothing.",
"Her father did not know how to make a living.",
"Her mother did not know how to bring up her children.",
"The father moved from place to place.",
"But when she was well enough, she worked away.",
"She wrote books.",
"Which one?",
"Does this answer our question?",
"He looks at something a long time to study it.",
"It is certainly true.",
"It looked as if he knew something and he might know much.",
"Now, however, it looked as if he must stop.",
"It looked as if he were going to see the end of the play.",
"One lost it now and then.",
"Where we want action we get talk.",
"Things looked bad.",
"If he lost, he was done for, and the house must fall.",
"But it was nearly over now.",
"Why should it not be happy?",
"What is this that we are building?",
"The answer would have been much the same.",
"I looked around the room.",
"No one was with me.",
"How could it have happened?",
"Might I not find one?",
"Yes, a piece was gone.",
"I looked away from her.",
"I never moved.",
"He turned around.",
"He had left a light.",
"They seemed less far than before, but still going on.",
"I tried, and called.",
"What has happened?",
"No one would see me go in.",
"It was so near, how could I help it?",
"I began to hope.",
"She turned with a start.",
"An hour ago!",
"The piece is original.",
"She works on piece work now, getting the same rate as men.",
"She has cause.",
"The government looked on.",
"Let us look them over one by one.",
"And she is just one of many who have been taking up such work.",
"No one seems to be able to get too many of her kind.",
"They could, but in private life they never do.",
"Yet, as he told us, things cannot always be as we would like to have them.",
"Still he saw no one.",
"There was no light.",
"He called the attention of the others to it.",
"The men moved away.",
"He moved away.",
"I knew a great deal about his private life, if I may say so.",
"But why, I ask?",
"It did not matter if they looked at some things in different ways, but their final decision must be the same.",
"But I soon saw him again, and again.",
"I tried to get it out, but I could not.",
"He tried to make out what was being said, but he was too far away for that.",
"And a good one I found it.",
"What had happened above?",
"There was still some one in the house.",
"How came I to stay so long!",
"But a question had been asked, and I must answer it.",
"I looked again.",
"If it were the same, then some of the words were gone.",
"Then the note itself!",
"Whether I did or not, I cannot say.",
"Why did I take heart?",
"I had even seen her in one.",
"Everybody who knew her will ask that.",
"I will make a note of it.",
"Tell her there was no one else to bring it up.",
"He had gone far enough, he thought.",
"And she was gone.",
"Could it be her husband?",
"Well, that was easy enough.",
"I would risk one question, but no more.",
"She cannot come.",
"But he tried her again.",
"She must be very happy.",
"It was a hard case, any way I looked at it.",
"It might be her father.",
"When I left the room, I turned to look at her.",
"One was enough.",
"We were quite alone.",
"It was a good ways from the house.",
"No answer this time.",
"Was there not some one to understand?",
"The next day would be soon enough.",
"He was going, but turned to look at her again.",
"All his mind and heart were on his next move.",
"She did not answer at once.",
"Here is the note.",
"I could not read the note.",
"And some one had been there before me!",
"I knew of no one.",
"This was significant, and I turned.",
"Whether it was the one he had first had in mind, I cannot say.",
"Where was the rest of it?",
"This is how it happened.",
"She did not move toward him.",
"And he knew that there was death all about him, and that he was the cause of it.",
"But it was very near now.",
"Something happened very soon after that.",
"She looked like a child.",
"Then he began to go down.",
"But he was happy at having the woman so near to him, and talking to him.",
"The man turned.",
"They were alone.",
"He looked in.",
"For days, in her way, she tried to tell him.",
"If so, she saw this one.",
"Sometimes he was gone for hours.",
"He turned.",
"And then, one night, the call came to her.",
"I cannot tell.",
"Leave him free.",
"May it please!",
"I love them from my very heart.",
"She gave him news of his wife.",
"They looked at it and went away.",
"One night their father saw them.",
"They told him all that had happened.",
"They went away alone.",
"One day he went to market.",
"He left her alone.",
"The people began to come out.",
"The good man took his wife to his house.",
"The child gave that answer.",
"It was a question I could not answer.",
"She made no answer.",
"But he was gone.",
"She turned and looked back at her husband.",
"No one moved to see them off.",
"They would leave them behind for the other old couple that was to come.",
"For a space there was no answer.",
"The hour came.",
"The answer is not difficult.",
"When I tried it was too late.",
"Almost any one could do all this.",
"Only it would have been fun to hand it over to his father!",
"If, however, he could not make more water run out of the well, he could make it more difficult for what did come from it to get away.",
"Something seemed to be always going wrong!",
"It had a power of its own, but one cannot say it had much to look at.",
"He found no answer to the question.",
"His heart was not in his words.",
"It was a hard thing to ask a man to do.",
"I cannot remember the time when I did not know and love him.",
"Of my life at college, little need be said.",
"The story of one day was the story of all the others.",
"One word more.",
"It was the husband and father come home.",
"Yet if that had happened, where was the body?",
"As I expected, not one was there.",
"But every night must end, as this one did at last.",
"I had no need to ask myself the question.",
"He looked at me without saying a word.",
"We were off without further words, and were soon well on our way.",
"This time he seemed to know me.",
"He turned from me and looked about the room.",
"I had tried to stop her more than once.",
"I want it very particularly.",
"But the others were nearly as bad.",
"Be strong.",
"But the matter did not rest here.",
"But he never looked at her.",
"Be near to me now.",
"Am I still alone?",
"All is gone.",
"All is gone!",
"I know it is difficult.",
"There was no particular cause of difference between them.",
"I do not agree.",
"And it is fine that it should be so.",
"And there is no answer, because the answer is too close at hand for us to see it.",
"There can be only one answer.",
"They had turned in.",
"We are very near the line.",
"He turned and went out.",
"They ask why.",
"They have gone under, but we have not gone under.",
"The people may say what they please.",
"Leave me.",
"Some like to be one thing, some another.",
"There may be no way, but it will not give up trying to find one.",
"But after a while he began to think that there was some living thing in it, which was always near him though he could not see what it was.",
"No one knew of such a place.",
"Father said there was nothing to see there.",
"In any case, the man seemed quite at home there.",
"I hope to try one of these days.",
"Answer yes or no.",
"A week had gone by.",
"The party up there must have been a very interesting one.",
"My mother was gone from me for ever!",
"I also called each one of the others by a new name.",
"It is but one man the less!",
"I cannot say.",
"If it is not, we would ask, where is it?",
"But nothing happened!",
"There was no evidence of decision or any plan.",
"But nothing hit it while we were there.",
"The other was very near to death.",
"We had soon come back.",
"And that night one did not try.",
"In the first place, let us take myself.",
"He has tried to get it already.",
"The years between seemed only a little while.",
"The light is bad, and we have very much the same figure.",
"I do not think he ever heard my answer.",
"Had he gone?",
"But I did not answer.",
"But tell me one thing more.",
"We cannot leave her here like this.",
"I looked about me to find we were in the center of a group of men.",
"And then I knew what had happened.",
"And yet one is different.",
"Was it possible that my father had no hand in it?",
"It seemed already as though she were further away.",
"It will please him.",
"The whole thing was over in half an hour.",
"And, one other matter.",
"Then the other looked up.",
"Father will take it.",
"Next morning, however, there was real cause for talk.",
"These were all on one page.",
"I do, with all my heart, I am sure.",
"She read books, in order that she might tell him stories.",
"He looked at me very much.",
"Her decision was made.",
"This soon came.",
"What that first part of the law means I cannot tell.",
"They were a bad people, and, perhaps, she had been as bad as the rest.",
"One word more, and I have done.",
"He has given us wife and child.",
"But by that rule we cannot love every one, for every one is not good.",
"To give one example.",
"Now I can only answer that it is not so.",
"And what answer is that?",
"It is to me a matter of fact and experience.",
"I am too far gone.",
"I believe that, with all my heart.",
"So difficult to think of one thing at a time.",
"These words are strong.",
"I think it very fine.",
"But to these questions there can perhaps never be an answer.",
"A decision was what was needed.",
"It is easy to understand how important and how strong it must once have been.",
"I may not live an hour.",
"He did not answer.",
"Still, he had been happy.",
"Perhaps he had never been so happy before in all his life.",
"I feel the same way myself.",
"There was but one thing to be done.",
"Some one was before them, however.",
"Make me one.",
"Mind, I have only heard read one book.",
"But I cannot always feel so.",
"Come back one day.",
"The hope is gone.",
"I feel as if I had read all the books I want to read.",
"I can only say the fact, that I have read it with attention and interest.",
"We have got our books into our new house.",
"The husband came in from the little back room.",
"The man and his wife were in.",
"The human heart is much the same in all conditions of life.",
"He had been in, and he had gone out again, so we came away, and saw nothing of him.",
"Then it happened!",
"So these were called books!",
"That seemed like a very good question to ask, for it would mean that when we look out into space, we are really looking back into time.",
"It was coming toward him.",
"But once he did, it was easy after that.",
"No, this cannot be for real.",
"I am strong!",
"The very least she could do would have been to bring his family here!",
"But I cannot help what I am.",
"But he had already come up with one such plan.",
"He knew who worked in the city, who was late, and who went in early.",
"She looked around her.",
"I am so happy.",
"This was exactly what happened.",
"The questions were not difficult.",
"Soon these were all full.",
"It will become all one thing or all the other.",
"Then, in a few days, came the decision.",
"I cannot do that.",
"One thing, however, was done.",
"And he looked it all.",
"I was very happy at last.",
"Support me in that trying hour when I most need it!",
"Do stay with us a few months.",
"School life began early.",
"No one could make them out.",
"Her good works at this place were not few.",
"Her parents of no note at all.",
"So may my husband.",
"They are as true of heart as we are.",
"Stay here.",
"What should the cause be?",
"I thought I would read them every one.",
"I took down first one book, then another.",
"At the end of a week I found that my father and mother had gone out very early in the morning.",
"Every one, in fact, was there.",
"I was so happy.",
"One can never tell.",
"She had only half an hour.",
"Not so soon.",
"She tried once again, but nothing could move him from his decision.",
"For them one disease is as another.",
"It is a fine night.",
"He began reading again.",
"But she could not have made one out of the number love her.",
"She was not looking at the matter from his point of view at all.",
"She looked up into his face.",
"It was a question, but not one that a man can answer.",
"I do not care one way or the other.",
"I have not long to stay.",
"It was easy enough, of course.",
"It is so easy to think that they are not what they seem.",
"He has always been in and out of our house like one of the family.",
"Perhaps it seemed to him that a woman should have no need to ask such a question.",
"She turned and looked at him.",
"She only had half an hour.",
"She thought that she was looking for her husband.",
"For I know there is some one.",
"They were alone in the room.",
"Please remember that.",
"She had tried.",
"We cannot get away from it.",
"They both turned.",
"All this in order to be near one of us.",
"It is to be near one of us.",
"But I have tried to do so.",
"I read it there, and she saw me reading.",
"This might have been one of them.",
"One cannot do such things as that.",
"He did not ask her to do so.",
"They have tried to stay it in this country.",
"Then he turned toward her.",
"See, they near!",
"And he so near, so near!",
"Call no one.",
"The quality may be just as fine in one place as in another.",
"And look at the personal side of college life.",
"Therefore the talk turned on money.",
"The women must have nearly as many.",
"It is not difficult.",
"Most of the old members have probably moved away.",
"That business was soon out of the way.",
"And so was my wife.",
"Ask him.",
"They seem easy to get along with.",
"They were not easy to find.",
"He made me want to go to college.",
"It is perhaps for this reason that few true stories of early times have come down to us.",
"One thing is certain.",
"He came first to one turn, then another.",
"We tried what we could.",
"His line had been turned.",
"What could my husband do more?",
"In short, I began to live again.",
"It seemed to be quite an original and individual performance.",
"This kind of thing cannot be done.",
"One note for her!",
"Now that everything was still, they seemed to come back to her.",
"Then they had taken leave.",
"The time was already near at hand when all the children had to get back to school.",
"Just he happy.",
"How happy he had been!",
"I hope a good one.",
"Please let me in.",
"I can leave that to those who get up late.",
"With this he took his leave.",
"She could not answer at once.",
"So I stay with her and I like to do it because she is so nice.",
"She related everything that had happened and all the questions he had asked her.",
"But this is only a personal view.",
"But that cannot be.",
"They have certainly been started, but with what result?",
"Will she ever pay the rest?",
"And how near we came to this!",
"We then tried to get reports.",
"I was in a house which was hit several times.",
"Then I turned to my work again.",
"The number was certainly large.",
"They have a mind in the matter, not only, but a heart also.",
"There is no law for building this house, and yet it is built.",
"Not so with her father.",
"But my heart!",
"I stay.",
"They were good friends once, and women take these things to heart.",
"I knew that I was big and strong, and they knew it, too.",
"Again I seemed to read between the lines of her words.",
"Then I looked back.",
"From the top I looked back.",
"After a few minutes I looked back behind me.",
"I turned to go, and he looked after me.",
"Something of the same kind happened to each of the other children.",
"He was a good father and they all knew it.",
"Here is one.",
"What happened is this.",
"Here is one of them.",
"But the thing is not so easy.",
"We cannot do too much for them.",
"This cannot be.",
"This has been the general experience.",
"It happened in the following way.",
"Still, it is said to have been performed.",
"Because of their experience?",
"There was just one way left to him now.",
"There was only one thing to be done.",
"I could not stay.",
"He was reading.",
"They certainly were not.",
"One night they did not come home.",
"No one had seen them.",
"That was the way with all stories.",
"Why bring her back?",
"Let him alone!",
"Experience, however, showed that this would not answer.",
"One thing more.",
"I would rather say no more on the subject now.",
"The story of the next hour I never told or can tell.",
"It never happened before.",
"Before I went to college I did pretty well.",
"Please tell us.",
"No night in all his life before had been like this one.",
"There was something different about her, that seemed certain.",
"No one can tell how bad.",
"But he was fine.",
"There was no one present.",
"How different and interesting the points of view of different men!",
"What would change his father?",
"It was difficult to find them.",
"Then he had to rest.",
"I had the light.",
"If only he could have had a word with his father!",
"Once he looked back.",
"He found he needed a rest.",
"He seemed to be taking leave of them.",
"It was hard to leave.",
"He always began that way.",
"He wrote it to me.",
"The hour was still early.",
"My stay here must be short.",
"And I will stay a couple of days.",
"There was only one answer to that.",
"I want to take him there myself.",
"He tried to stop.",
"No one came or left.",
"Certainly he had not been thinking of her.",
"It cannot be true.",
"He could not answer that.",
"One is as good as another.",
"They sure looked bad.",
"Yet it did not very much matter how she looked or what happened.",
"And there she wanted to rest.",
"But I cannot do any of these things.",
"And that is one thing wrong with people.",
"I think women have more to do with war then men, even if they do stay home.",
"She just looked at me.",
"But perhaps that is not the great experience which will come to me.",
"But that is gone.",
"They seemed to like his talk and his looks.",
"He could not answer then.",
"It had come from behind his own lines.",
"But all seemed clear.",
"That takes time.",
"No answer!",
"Then she turned away her face.",
"Looked good to me!",
"Then it happened.",
"Then I looked.",
"I thought of no one else.",
"Yet war comes despite them.",
"When the father came home after this interview he could not keep it to himself.",
"I saw them nearly every day.",
"It is a long time now since any one has told me that!",
"He began at once on the subject.",
"I cannot quite take it in.",
"I have never known the college without him, and it will make all things different.",
"We looked at one another, and said nothing.",
"Why cannot a man act himself, be himself, and think for himself?",
"She told her stories at all times when they happened to come into her mind.",
"Leave her alone, men.",
"I know of no cause.",
"I mean to leave that decision to the men themselves.",
"We can call out now and then, so if any one heard us they might answer.",
"I was too well used to these, however, to pay them any special attention.",
"What I need is rest.",
"My, but how the people turned out.",
"The answer was a long time coming.",
"He turned to be off.",
"The answer came before the question could have been put into words.",
"About this one thing, I mean.",
"No one has a right more than any other man.",
"He turned back to the room.",
"But he was of no mind to stay.",
"And, alone, thought things out.",
"So he went down toward the house.",
"She knew what was in his heart!",
"Leave word for me.",
"And I guess there was enough there for everybody in all the world.",
"They could go in one way, come out another.",
"But there was only an hour of this.",
"He turned and left her.",
"That was his only answer.",
"Once she thought he was going to fall.",
"He began to come down.",
"But she knew that he had not gone a great deal further.",
"Some one?",
"How long he was gone she did not know.",
"At first she did not try to answer.",
"She had not moved.",
"He knew now just what he would do, since it had become clear to him that there was but one thing to be done.",
"He turned then and went about his work.",
"Some one else was coming, too.",
"He looked back up at her.",
"But he was a human being, and she was no longer alone!",
"He has gone?",
"Still no one saw her.",
"And still no one saw.",
"Where is the rest of it?",
"A man went down, she did not know which one.",
"She turned toward them.",
"In their light she saw him.",
"There has been no one near.",
"And the days are fine again.",
"The rest be left to me.",
"Have I not cause to love her?",
"Leave him to my care.",
"There were so many questions they wanted to ask.",
"And then something happened.",
"In this way they did not fall down.",
"But he did not mind that, and was soon up again.",
"But the children were happy for all that.",
"So I started with him alone.",
"She was gone!",
"Take them or leave them.",
"No one must know.",
"But that good day is gone.",
"My father is not.",
"Maybe that was why things had gone wrong.",
"The children are having a party.",
"One day a note was given to him to take home.",
"Would she please let them know at once?",
"He seemed to know what was coming.",
"It is easy going for the rest of us now.",
"I want some one of my own.",
"I just wanted her to stay and talk to me.",
"This is one of the times.",
"It seemed as if she must read whatever was in his heart.",
"Tell me the one word.",
"He was alone!",
"And is not my father his father also?",
"Where did they fall?",
"There seemed to be always something new to do.",
"We cannot be happy here.",
"The list is a long one.",
"But she never would, and I would not leave her.",
"I was the only one left.",
"My mother never seemed the same after this.",
"She did not stay long in there.",
"I happened to be in the house at the time.",
"It seemed too good to be true.",
"They did nothing for any one but themselves from morning to night.",
"This is the only one left.",
"There was no one in the front of the house.",
"She looked out, but could not see him.",
"It is now some years since all this happened, and I might as well tell the end of it.",
"She tried to, but she could not.",
"As there were so many of them they usually went different ways.",
"Something must have happened to her or she would come to me.",
"Then he began again.",
"It was almost as light as day.",
"Father left him to have it out with himself, and went to the house.",
"Something must have happened to him.",
"One thing was as bad as the other.",
"Sometimes on very fine days they get out all day.",
"A few days later, he told me the rest of his history.",
"He went away one day last summer, and no one ever knew what became of him.",
"Well, leave me to think of it.",
"There was some one behind her.",
"That was her answer.",
"The mother called but got no answer.",
"A man cannot remember every thing!",
"One more morning came.",
"One could but try.",
"No one saw him come.",
"An answer came from within.",
"White, but her husband was gone.",
"He wrote to his mother, and told her so.",
"The watch are gone.",
"She gave him no time to answer.",
"This is a large subject.",
"It is difficult to answer.",
"Who can answer that?",
"What then, has happened to them?",
"One thing at least is clear.",
"What in our blood is sex?",
"Finally they are all gone.",
"That is but one example.",
"That alone was not all.",
"Please come and help me!",
"Now, the question is what are we going to do the rest of the night?",
"I got a light, I did.",
"No one said a word.",
"Come home early, and bring me something nice from the city.",
"She was very happy.",
"That will be easy enough.",
"To do as we please?",
"Let us put a question that goes to the very heart of the problem.",
"It is not the main thing that I have to say here.",
"Will it go along those lines?",
"They may be done quite soon.",
"They can hit it on every side.",
"Let us get on to more general conditions.",
"Leave well enough alone.",
"Turn we to read the one original!",
"Her heart was full of love.",
"No place of rest for man!",
"Now hear my answer.",
"It cannot be!",
"We cannot, mother, live for ever.",
"One thing more happened that day.",
"That was one good thing.",
"Then he told me that was the one they wanted him to try for.",
"One sure thing, he was game.",
"He was pretty game, that was one sure thing.",
"Look at the way he wanted to go away and be alone by himself.",
"He just wanted to be alone.",
"He just wanted to go home and be all alone by himself.",
"He happened to be there.",
"But I just happened to think of something I wanted to say and so as soon as I could get started, I said it right out.",
"It looked like a great well.",
"He seemed different from the way he was before.",
"They seemed to be getting a lot of fun out of it anyway.",
"Action was to be his course.",
"One at a time.",
"I never knew he would ask for money!",
"Some one call her!",
"He seemed lost in thought.",
"But no, it cannot be.",
"But may he live long and happy.",
"I believe we understand one another.",
"Go and be happy.",
"Sure, it is too much, it cannot be!",
"Then the fun began.",
"There was one in the group who had not said a word so far.",
"One was up higher than the rest.",
"It all happened in a second.",
"I know how it happened, too.",
"The children thought it was certainly time he did so.",
"As it was, it seemed hard enough.",
"He does not need any one.",
"All alone.",
"Go on, please, where we left off.",
"Are the rest coming?",
"I have asked everybody.",
"By and by it was gone.",
"Now, at the same place, and by the same light, they had heard the last.",
"She was one of the children that are left to themselves.",
"That was an hour ago.",
"Perhaps he had something to do with it then as he certainly had something to do with it now.",
"I think I should have to let them read the old books.",
"It happened this way.",
"It has not been difficult.",
"And he was going into business with the money, very soon.",
"The child is not always happy.",
"I want some one to think well enough of it to take the risk.",
"I have tried and I know.",
"Father always does that, but this was not father.",
"How many things could I do in an hour?",
"I am happy enough today.",
"The one last night was about a name!",
"Now study, please.",
"Ask my father.",
"Just one.",
"What a short hour and a half!",
"He would be home before very long, and tell them all the rest.",
"She was not happy enough.",
"It was a new experience, not to be happy.",
"In his thought she was always strong.",
"It was not in my heart to do that!",
"A whole hour.",
"To this call there was no answer.",
"It is difficult at times to believe it to be true.",
"To them it looks up for food and help.",
"Where, I ask again, did they get it?",
"I ask.",
"I cannot see that.",
"I cannot see why we should.",
"And in order to be able to think of them, by reading of them.",
"Answer that.",
"If that part of the story be not true, I care nothing for the rest.",
"This it is which makes it different from all books in the world.",
"In the first place it was probably not their father.",
"He tried to work out this problem.",
"On other days he had gone out with others.",
"If the man were like himself it would be an easy matter.",
"He must leave.",
"That has to stop, and the only way for me to stop it is to go off all by myself.",
"Yet he did not approach one end of it.",
"But no one came.",
"The next morning he went out to his work with a light heart.",
"He looked again.",
"She can do that easy.",
"Leave the rest to me.",
"For myself, I do not understand what it means.",
"Still, he knew he was not alone.",
"I happened, one night, to be where I had no right to be.",
"There is more than one way in and out.",
"So it may have seemed to him.",
"But they never even looked our way.",
"Did he fall for it?",
"That made it difficult.",
"What else can one do?",
"Why leave it all to me?",
"As it was, the business was difficult enough.",
"My little one!",
"She was an hour late.",
"He looked him up and down.",
"It began to close up a little.",
"He began to tell his story quite as if nothing had happened.",
"He had never looked so happy in all his life.",
"He had never been so happy before in all big life.",
"And it is so close to the works too.",
"It seemed as if all the past were coming back.",
"All that I could get out of her was that children cost one a good deal more than they bring in.",
"But really I need not ask it.",
"She never even tried!",
"Such a fine child it was!",
"Can one understand such a thing?",
"I cannot believe it.",
"We are so happy alone together!",
"And then we look at one another.",
"Why was he being taken to the works?",
"What was it that happened?",
"Since she heard nothing, perhaps nothing had really happened.",
"Then, though she still said nothing, she looked at him.",
"But come, father, what is really the matter?",
"And few men would agree with themselves from one day or one week to another.",
"How should they not under the conditions?",
"So much I may say, but I cannot say more.",
"I do not believe it is possible to answer that question.",
"What happened, in fact?",
"The position of the military is not difficult to understand.",
"From their point of view there was good reason.",
"He has never tried being one.",
"I will be happy in despite of state.",
"What, not one?",
"Not one.",
"What, comes not one?",
"I mean not to stay long.",
"Say on, with all my heart.",
"How, wife?",
"How now, wife?",
"I have a wife.",
"Father, here I am.",
"Good father, do.",
"Nothing but of a husband for me, mother.",
"A husband!",
"Father, a wife!",
"Why, we cannot tell.",
"Why, this is fine.",
"Whether I could or no, father, I did.",
"Father, I did!",
"Good husband, hear him.",
"Yet stay, I have some hope.",
"It does not please me well.",
"With all my heart.",
"My father?",
"And had she not always found him a good husband to her?",
"There was one hope left.",
"That was easy enough.",
"Perhaps, too, that was because he had not left them off any too soon.",
"What a long hour that was!",
"There comes one.",
"A whole one!",
"The position was not really a strong one.",
"All say, however, that it will come in the near future.",
"But even then they were not happy.",
"All the other states are in a similar position.",
"No one knew whether and when we should see each other again.",
"They worked hard.",
"He could get no answer.",
"I have seen to it myself.",
"They would make a difference in any cause.",
"And I have no one to talk to.",
"And I am quite happy here.",
"There is some one coming.",
"And she has some one with her.",
"One was open.",
"Everything any one ever says to me.",
"I cannot get away.",
"They cannot do it in these times.",
"Come, let us change the subject, my child.",
"I am alone in the house.",
"He did not ask after him.",
"He looked at his father.",
"But when she turned he was never looking at her.",
"His mind was in its original state of white paper.",
"No one would play with him.",
"I have had experience.",
"Do not we know one another?",
"He does not find, but bring.",
"Books think for me.",
"He was as one, being with us, but not of us.",
"With nothing to live on, he seemed to live on everything.",
"Here and there we find an original.",
"But what wife, and what children?",
"See note above.",
"I cannot be sure who this was.",
"I cannot say where it now is.",
"All others, however, seemed left for us alone.",
"They could only see one side at a time.",
"I was happy to have been a part of it.",
"Before we left she gave me some books to take home to read.",
"We look to the original of things.",
"But let us try to help one another.",
"My father in the morning saw this first of men.",
"He could not look at me, and I turned away from him.",
"I was much moved.",
"I was let alone.",
"These lines did their work.",
"I could not long be easy there.",
"Any one could understand that.",
"We looked at each other.",
"At last he seemed to light something.",
"I was a private then.",
"They seemed to understand each other at once.",
"I first took him for one of our men.",
"It seemed well to do so.",
"For myself, I should have set this thing to different words.",
"But this was a thing to be turned.",
"I had lost myself.",
"Take it easy.",
"Bring him to me.",
"I am strong now.",
"This is so because we are made that way and cannot help it.",
"Or we say, I cannot do so and so because I have not the means.",
"What can one do with such a people?",
"But there were other ways in which one made it up to them, if they did but know it.",
"But there is less time for words than for action, just now.",
"He got no answer.",
"He is gone!",
"He was always and in all things a strong man.",
"They had never tried.",
"He turned away from the subject.",
"I cannot, I will not believe it.",
"One would think so.",
"He turned away.",
"He turned to go.",
"Why should there have been an answer?",
"They have all, one by one, told me the same story.",
"No, for then he would have heard a fall.",
"So they were left alone.",
"But I could not rest in them.",
"But what is one more among so many?",
"That cannot matter to me.",
"We alone keep them.",
"I cannot.",
"That is my view.",
"I have gone further.",
"It is true that it was at one time our money.",
"This is strong language.",
"He was very much moved.",
"But he is my husband.",
"I did not know what to answer.",
"And then he turned to me.",
"I was not long in making up my mind on the subject.",
"I looked in.",
"This service is to me a very important one.",
"If this does not answer, I cannot see any thing at present that will.",
"They seemed as if they could not part from us.",
"Then the service began.",
"He was gone, actually gone.",
"There was, however, but the one thing to do.",
"She said something about her father.",
"An hour later the others came.",
"He was gone before she could make any response.",
"There was a new look in her face, a look of decision.",
"He looked back into the office.",
"He looked away from her.",
"It was because she was the only one.",
"There was no one else for her, either.",
"She was gone before he could stop her.",
"I want to be left alone, and I will be left alone.",
"I tried it.",
"The answer came in less than that time.",
"The second is just one question.",
"That in itself makes a man of any one.",
"However, I tried a new move.",
"She may even be one of those.",
"He turned his head.",
"Everything was made easy for him.",
"Then she looked around.",
"I am going to live for myself.",
"Try and remember who I am and what we used to mean to one another.",
"I used to think I could live alone.",
"No one can stop that.",
"The evidence is too strong.",
"I want some one to take care of me.",
"And, after all, nothing happened.",
"In less than half an hour the play would be over.",
"They were alone at last.",
"Father left her a little money.",
"We were not quite sure what a father might do.",
"There was nothing to do on the range.",
"Looks like it.",
"Well, I did one good thing.",
"As a matter of fact, a private car.",
"I had had enough of this one.",
"He turned to leave the room.",
"I looked at her.",
"Here is his note.",
"They turned in.",
"And he looked it.",
"Who can answer such questions?",
"Only one then!",
"Looks like it, I must say.",
"I think this is one.",
"Well, something has happened to him.",
"I want to give my attention to it.",
"No answer came to these questions.",
"Then he turned to her.",
"He turned up.",
"He had no particularly clear plan.",
"After that, they got to their business in a private room.",
"The others all of them are gone.",
"Would they guess the thing that had happened?",
"How far away they seemed!",
"He could have done it alone just as well as not.",
"It did not seem possible so much could have happened in so short a time.",
"They were not sure but they had started more than it would be easy to stop.",
"All were range men and were well known to one another.",
"What would he do with a wife if he had one?",
"He tried hard to remember.",
"Yet these are very fine.",
"One more.",
"But some are very fine.",
"Father of all!",
"But the time is over and gone.",
"We were once very happy.",
"Stay with me, my little one!",
"I was happy.",
"Then he looked into my face.",
"I tried to reason that a change was a rest.",
"Not a word had I to give in answer.",
"No answer came.",
"My heart is strong.",
"As such he must be tried.",
"I can not see him fall.",
"My heart is good!",
"They are gone.",
"Help is near!",
"We cannot give even to our own little children.",
"There was no one near.",
"Night and morning, it is all one to me.",
"I never thought of saying to myself, I am, or I can do, so and so.",
"I seemed to have nothing left to live for.",
"But it was some time longer before I began to know this by personal experience.",
"There is no one.",
"There is no one, I am sure.",
"I want to order some books.",
"Please leave me out.",
"Anything happened?",
"So soon!",
"I cannot!",
"What would his father say and do?",
"Something has happened.",
"So real that it was almost difficult to believe that it was not he himself.",
"The man turned to his book.",
"No one seems to quite know where he has gone.",
"Do they look happy?",
"One party was on that one side, and that other on the other.",
"Yes, certainly.",
"It does not take us long to answer.",
"I think it will please us all to hear it over again.",
"And one said to another.",
"This done, they went to their rest again.",
"So they went to rest that night, because it was very late.",
"With all my heart, said the other.",
"It is an end I have long looked for.",
"I do not know myself how I came to it!",
"They are all gone into the world of light!",
"Yes, certainly!",
"No one knew.",
"No one is any longer anything.",
"I ask to be let alone.",
"I cannot tell!",
"Was it too soon?",
"I took one.",
"The man did not answer.",
"He turned to the right and then to the left.",
"This is what had happened.",
"There was no one there.",
"I have no one but this child in the world.",
"They did not answer him.",
"They went in one by one.",
"I looked at him.",
"He looked at the paper.",
"They had gone up to it.",
"Now, we were no longer alone.",
"No one could understand it.",
"I looked at this man.",
"I found no one there.",
"The little one then turned to me.",
"For we were so happy!",
"Some one came in.",
"I have tried every means.",
"She looked at me.",
"This takes place between officials.",
"They are happy!",
"Of what sex are they?",
"Who is this one?",
"And that one?",
"I looked around.",
"But I cannot.",
"At its hour, there it is.",
"His will, and his will alone, is their law.",
"Certainly not.",
"How then can such a system ever answer?",
"No one knew them.",
"What, gone?",
"This makes me see his heart in other things.",
"But who are these alone?",
"Then I have lost a wife.",
"Is that her husband?",
"Leave us.",
"Since he could not support a wife, he must give up his love.",
"He seemed to be in space.",
"As for her, she left the house very soon and went to her own home.",
"The matter began to interest him.",
"The day has nearly come.",
"It is the child, and alone!",
"She was in love with her husband, as he had been with her.",
"And one day he asked her if she would be his wife.",
"It was the one great question in the world to him.",
"He was a very happy man.",
"He was going to ask her to be his wife.",
"It may have been a little earlier or a little later.",
"Will some one say?",
"Then something happened.",
"Then she told of what had happened.",
"Nothing was to be had for love or money, as it seemed.",
"This was, as nearly as I can remember, all that took place between us.",
"After that, it seems, they got on very well together for the rest of the interview.",
"He told good stories and put much interest into them.",
"But he soon gave me one.",
"Again the performance was gone through.",
"Well, I had no answer.",
"It is true enough in common language I worked hard, but working by system made it easy.",
"It did not seem to be very strong, I thought.",
"I should like to say one word more.",
"The way out had been provided!",
"Even though we cannot see or guess what that way is to be, it will be provided.",
"I had to find ways of making a little more money.",
"Once more the way out had been provided.",
"It began to mean more to us, as we began each to mean more to the other.",
"And once more the way out was provided.",
"No one ever is.",
"He looked at her, and after a few minutes took me alone into his private office.",
"So into our present home we moved.",
"He looked all about him, but there was no one else to be seen.",
"What is the happy life?",
"With all my heart I hope that is true.",
"Where there are so many ways some of them are likely to be wrong.",
"Other men have tried the different ways.",
"They sometimes fall.",
"Such are some of the ways that lead through the world.",
"Once the first of these was started they would all go one after the other.",
"They were left to me by my father.",
"I can run that in half an hour.",
"They seemed far away.",
"One was quite large.",
"It looked that way.",
"Easy, now.",
"One thing I tried just now.",
"They seemed to be of a general group.",
"Is there more than one?",
"One was a man and the other a woman.",
"Then he turned and left the room.",
"And for that note!",
"Then he turned again to his paper.",
"But can one not?",
"They ask us to be children with them.",
"I looked around the little room.",
"I went to a private school.",
"I no longer considered myself as living for myself alone.",
"We cannot tell how far it will go.",
"To be worked out!",
"It would not be very difficult.",
"Where had she gone?",
"But what can one do?",
"The other did not answer.",
"He saw no one.",
"But not to rest!",
"But she did not answer.",
"He could not leave the woman.",
"He began to plan.",
"Ways and means were not hard to find.",
"Her head moved.",
"He left a wife and children.",
"They looked and looked.",
"For was she not near, right there by his side?",
"He started and did not answer at once.",
"He seemed to hear only her first words.",
"Did she take heart a little?",
"Not one?",
"Not a little one?",
"No one will buy them?",
"Of rest I found nothing at all.",
"No one could say, so we have given it up!",
"Very fine view.",
"She had heard her father say so.",
"He had no answer for this.",
"He was a man of action.",
"Let me go to father.",
"But the end was near.",
"He would find out pretty soon.",
"He tried to keep me back.",
"He tried to make me good and true.",
"The answer he could guess.",
"But not to stay down.",
"For that he had an answer.",
"She turned her head.",
"Any one would have done it.",
"It was a good world, if one only looked for the evidence of it.",
"Night would fall soon.",
"The first was the general one that he did not want any of her friends to know where he was.",
"She must get away soon.",
"Take it or leave it.",
"There was about her a quality very fine and taking.",
"He would show whether any one could come between him and his woman.",
"She say bring her father.",
"This was not easy.",
"One of her friends!",
"They moved toward the house.",
"But the one who had come was not the one who had gone.",
"She wanted to believe people fine and good and true.",
"Both of them wanted it over with as soon as possible.",
"This was what happened.",
"Now he takes second place.",
"It moved.",
"Every one was against him.",
"The man had moved.",
"They were gone.",
"His hour was coming.",
"Thinking could not change the conditions.",
"Bring him in.",
"Such was the policy.",
"Someone turned up the light.",
"Nothing has happened?",
"What use to have one?",
"I was happy then.",
"There was no face of which I had not a good view.",
"Perhaps he had expected to have easy work with me.",
"After all, he had gone out, but perhaps only for a short time.",
"That was what I told myself at first.",
"I even turned my back on him before he was gone.",
"I asked myself.",
"But what use to ask more questions?",
"It seemed as if the night would never end.",
"What could have happened?",
"But I was soon to know.",
"But it was a very hard thing that he had asked me to do, and he had said well in saying that he would not ask it of me if it did not mean more than his life.",
"Please go.",
"I wrote and asked if he had.",
"I want to rest, and just be happy, like other women.",
"I think if I worked for a man, I would work for him.",
"I would not work for him a part of the time, and the rest of the time work against him.",
"As it is, most people get too much of one kind of work.",
"Be a man and be a friend to everybody.",
"And this probably began it.",
"Please help her.",
"Please let me free.",
"But it happened all the same.",
"No one else can do it.",
"This time, nothing happened.",
"I am happy to go back to that small size.",
"After all, everybody knew that!",
"So everything worked out pretty well.",
"Our need is for more light.",
"And so of other and more complex cases.",
"These bring nothing to the general stock.",
"This is the common experience.",
"He looked but on the outside of man.",
"One of us might get him.",
"Only one.",
"Answer me that.",
"For it, or something like it, has happened too many times already.",
"This has happened too often.",
"There is one world.",
"Let us take them one by one.",
"He was looking away from her, and she looked at him.",
"It gave one hope for the whole species.",
"She thought that some one would come for her.",
"And they were alone.",
"Nothing to do with the rest of the play.",
"What was one to think?",
"She tried to find something to say.",
"She was gone a long time.",
"He had another wife.",
"She looked at him now.",
"For half an hour he read.",
"Our cause came on the last.",
"What good was it for me to try to please?",
"People came from far and near to hear him.",
"When they came in they began to question me.",
"There was a legal course that had to be gone through with.",
"Yet nearly all of them were.",
"One can see that she had very little time with the children.",
"So one night, when all was still, we started.",
"He never came near the house.",
"So I went back with a light heart.",
"In this way I worked up quite a business.",
"But the life is not one of play, by any means.",
"But perhaps I was not strong enough to do that.",
"No one knew what had become of him.",
"They never looked at but through one.",
"When she first came back, she was so happy, so strong.",
"If he would only come soon!",
"Not a single one!",
"Why should she ask what she was so sure of?",
"Would my father have done this?",
"Still one cannot know.",
"What was her answer?",
"Thus his works became his history.",
"How can I leave him thus?",
"I will not go without one word.",
"What had happened I could not tell.",
"I never saw that, but it is in the books.",
"Something out of the common must have happened.",
"Then there was an answer at once and they knew what was to be done.",
"Since no one knew anything about her past life, then everyone had the more to say about who she might have been.",
"But the wife did not give in.",
"But the rest is on the level.",
"And that alone was enough to make the whole world over.",
"If there were only some one who would talk to her!",
"I told her she might have one.",
"Why should I not stay here?",
"They were gone a year.",
"But how I worked!",
"But I had myself in hand now.",
"We cannot understand just what is the matter.",
"So I try to keep everything to myself.",
"But mother will not hear a word on the subject.",
"But there seemed no use in saying so.",
"Any one that wanted to could see them.",
"It began to look as if she was really going!",
"They were too happy for that.",
"Every one will know.",
"Some one was near.",
"There seemed time enough.",
"He seemed a different man.",
"I did what seemed to me right.",
"Every one looked toward the president.",
"They seemed to think I had no right to see inside of them.",
"Or if I did I cannot find it.",
"There was nothing to do now but take his leave.",
"Only one more day!",
"Or any one else.",
"He could not go, because he wanted so very much to stay.",
"And stay all day.",
"It seemed to be the end.",
"He tried to control himself.",
"She is like her father.",
"She seemed to have something else to say.",
"Then what had happened?",
"Mind reading is common with women.",
"He tried to answer her but no words came.",
"But there is a question I want to ask.",
"She looked up with a start.",
"She could not bring her mind to it.",
"She would be free soon, he said.",
"Next morning they had taken heart of hope again.",
"There was no answer to her call.",
"I cannot remember them.",
"There is only one thing to do now.",
"Only when she was quite alone did she ever give way.",
"No one had seen it.",
"It was going to be easy.",
"No one will know.",
"Please let the general read this.",
"One looks to me about the same as the other.",
"She was used to them in the other sex.",
"He hit it!",
"Please get the money back from him.",
"No one was to be seen.",
"Our books would show.",
"It happened to be my name.",
"This all happened before.",
"Had anything gone wrong?",
"She turned the next page.",
"She had turned quite white.",
"Everybody is happy in the end.",
"And, as I say, things are going to be easy.",
"The only one I could come to.",
"Leave that to me!",
"I can answer it in one word.",
"Then a lot of things happened all at once.",
"Anything might have happened.",
"What is one to believe?",
"What can one do?",
"But she would not have gone.",
"Soon it came.",
"It sometimes takes the public a long time to understand a matter, but their common sense is sure at last to bring them to the right side of any question.",
"It looked as if they were already gone.",
"But no answer came.",
"If he could not get leave he would go without it.",
"There was one heart, however, which had not done so.",
"They have already been provided for.",
"Perhaps they had only just gone.",
"Well, whatever the cause, our treatment is clear.",
"But one day was exactly like another.",
"The man was alone.",
"Well, I knew it by heart then, as I know it by heart now.",
"He has gone.",
"We looked.",
"Here, I have a white one.",
"The man turned his face away.",
"I cannot have him back.",
"But the old man was gone.",
"His mind seemed to be far away.",
"The old man did not answer.",
"The rest is easy.",
"Bring him here!",
"I will question him myself.",
"Some one had found him out.",
"But after a time he looked up again.",
"It cannot but come out right.",
"But there was nothing in the whole world now, nothing more, he said to himself, that he could think to ask for.",
"It seemed to him as though it were something that had taken place very long ago.",
"Then he went on to the heart of the city.",
"No good of himself certainly.",
"Then he was lost to view.",
"It was a piece of paper.",
"He was soon at work again.",
"But he had to stop and rest again.",
"At last he came to a place where there had been a fall.",
"But, after a little, he began to think that it was not quite so bad as it might have been after all.",
"It seemed to him, too, that he was very light in body.",
"But here was the fall again.",
"When he came to himself, he knew what had happened and where he was.",
"It did not light.",
"He thought to stay here until the end should come.",
"They will do good to one another.",
"I thought I had heard these lines before.",
"He may fall.",
"Her children wanted rest.",
"His money was all gone.",
"His death was of a piece with his life.",
"I am going alone.",
"I know it all by heart.",
"It would be very easy.",
"Everybody has heard of him.",
"His father would never have done that.",
"This cannot be done.",
"Away from the center.",
"And more, yet more would I ask.",
"They looked at each other and began to think.",
"Father is by no means well or strong.",
"And one may certainly have too much of a good thing.",
"Happy we!",
"Her husband was far away.",
"This was one of them.",
"May is building her house.",
"Have I the heart?",
"Never do we rest!",
"The husband, however, did not show himself.",
"One of these especially comes to mind.",
"His wife was a very big woman.",
"Her husband went to see what was wrong.",
"We were, however, quite alone.",
"Her husband got well this time also.",
"No man ever saw the rest of his body.",
"I knew one that got it, and he told me about it himself.",
"And an happened the same way as the day before.",
"In answer.",
"What his wife must do and be.",
"I see he has no mind to leave me if he can help it.",
"This is one of them.",
"Against myself too.",
"If I were, he should soon find the difference.",
"Let it be a short one.",
"Because I could not help myself, I went.",
"Why, pretty well in the main.",
"It looks as if it were in my power to do so.",
"Let them take care of one another.",
"I am not at fine words.",
"She is gone.",
"As soon as she could, she would.",
"How can she think to be a wife?",
"This cut me to the heart.",
"I had not a word to say for myself.",
"I cannot before.",
"To be sure I do please!",
"The day of days the subject.",
"And now to the subject next my heart.",
"He was too happy!",
"But how did she know about me to ask me too?",
"So the party began.",
"It is very easy.",
"Each child went alone into his little house.",
"She only takes care of those who have no one else.",
"They needed some one to talk with about their mother.",
"And that seemed to end it.",
"They asked every one they could find whether he had seen her.",
"I will find a way to them soon.",
"Where the party was to be no one told her, and she did not ask.",
"People could see her if they looked hard enough.",
"But soon it will go on again.",
"The child was taken to one place, the mother to another.",
"I will do what I please with him.",
"And now she, too, was gone.",
"She had been gone more than a year.",
"Her next thought was to see his wife, if she was at home.",
"She turned it over.",
"And then began the school day.",
"It was the final period of the day, and soon school was over.",
"It was a hard answer to give.",
"Some one will be coming in here.",
"She has gone for the day.",
"That is why I think she wrote the note.",
"That man may be the one whose money we found!",
"The house was as nearly like it had been as was possible to leave it.",
"She turned and looked at the man.",
"The others looked at her.",
"That was fine.",
"It seemed to be a long time.",
"The little man looked at it.",
"It used to say that when it thought a great deal it could remember things which it seemed to have heard a long time ago.",
"I would rather stay where I am than have to do all they do.",
"She seemed to be used to it.",
"It was a good many days after that, that something happened.",
"And let it be a big one.",
"Come near, my friends, for I am near my end.",
"One is our friend, and the other is not true.",
"Father, I am.",
"That cannot be.",
"This for myself.",
"But I will answer.",
"What, up so soon?",
"Why should they stay?",
"Good night and good rest.",
"As soon as I can find him.",
"Go home before, make all things very fine.",
"A wife!",
"Do, and let me alone to close with him.",
"But here my husband comes.",
"Far be it from my heart to think that thought.",
"What, love, alone!",
"Soon after she knew.",
"She knew the hour must be late.",
"She turned to lead the way inside.",
"It was soon over.",
"She was a woman without a heart.",
"Now she must act against her husband.",
"He was quite happy again.",
"But the paper was gone.",
"When he got up she was gone.",
"Who showed me the course, I cannot tell.",
"I knew he was strong.",
"But the case had gone so far that there was only one way of doing this.",
"Bring to an end this business of the war.",
"He looked about him.",
"What species of deal was toward?",
"Gone again now.",
"This might be one of those times and it might not.",
"And it all costs money.",
"Why, the man was old enough to be her father.",
"Her head was still turned away.",
"They had not been moved.",
"That one.",
"More likely an hour.",
"Done it myself in his place.",
"No one knew what he thought.",
"I hit my head on it!",
"Question is, who did he hit?",
"Her head turned back.",
"He looked.",
"He looked to the left.",
"These last were very difficult questions to answer.",
"But how to get out was the difficult matter.",
"Let him answer that.",
"I must just go and see after my wife for a few minutes.",
"But he did not answer.",
"And it all began to come back to him.",
"If I tried not to do it, I should do it all the same.",
"One thing I am sure of.",
"They had gone!",
"One thing seems sure.",
"He did not move once during my reading.",
"It was the one thing left me to do.",
"It was easy.",
"All had gone, and life might go too.",
"All was provided for.",
"And so it happened.",
"But I cannot agree with him.",
"I, certainly, was not.",
"Sometimes I worked there quite alone.",
"But let me go, please.",
"I want to be alone.",
"Not that I would care for myself.",
"Please bring them along at once.",
"It seemed as if the light had gone out of my life for ever.",
"It is difficult to tell.",
"Death to him was a rest.",
"What is the great first cause of all things?",
"That was original.",
"To do right was the main thing, because it was right.",
"How far they were themselves original we cannot tell.",
"This soon took place.",
"He cannot be found.",
"We know but little of his private life.",
"He may be very good or very bad, and yet be only such because he is particularly so.",
"We can like what food we please.",
"Why alone.",
"A good father.",
"Late reading.",
"What is an early hour?",
"One of these is nearly related to the former.",
"I have seen this tried again and again.",
"The current may be turned out of its course a little while, it is true, but not always.",
"But what is an early hour?",
"Leave me!",
"Which it certainly was.",
"But here, within the house, was he alone?",
"I do not love the one thing, I love all.",
"They certainly were too big for the office.",
"What a fall!",
"Of those that were thus taken, I was one.",
"With all my heart!",
"Certainly not!",
"Well, what has happened is past.",
"I asked him the reason, and what happened to him.",
"I cannot help myself.",
"She was not alone.",
"He moved!",
"She was not long alone.",
"She turned away.",
"An experience that, among others!",
"Yes, certainly blood!",
"The study of woman is a new one to me.",
"I was at college.",
"What the result is to be no one can yet tell.",
"I wrote him a note.",
"I am all alone.",
"Is his reason gone?",
"This happened again and again.",
"The good man and his wife had but recently come into the country.",
"It was certainly such to me.",
"As it was, I very nearly did both.",
"He did not know how near the people were to him.",
"Husband out of work!",
"Of course it is not real, and every one may go.",
"On the last day he saw several of his friends and took leave of them.",
"And never was my heart more light.",
"Happy time!",
"All out of range.",
"Long rest!",
"Well, answer me.",
"She has never been to one.",
"Will no one else lead?",
"This would make all easy.",
"He may fall through!",
"I never was so happy in my life!",
"How can it have happened?",
"Ask her what she has done?",
"Is he not near at hand?",
"She takes it in her hand.",
"Hours ago the last light had gone out.",
"Why would she not answer him?",
"There was a world of love in the action.",
"Every face was turned toward him.",
"All were gone.",
"It would not leave him.",
"Now his hour is come.",
"It could not be the same world of an hour ago.",
"She tried to move, but could not.",
"And alone, too!",
"They were man and wife!",
"Answer me that, my father.",
"My father, these are my last words.",
"Could he leave her?",
"Yes, he must leave her!",
"How can he answer her?",
"I hope she will have a little rest now.",
"But everybody to their own mind.",
"And that happened over and over.",
"They had all gone.",
"It is not much I ask.",
"If she had, she added, she should not have turned their little ways into fun, as she had done in the story.",
"I put them all in myself.",
"They could not believe at first that he really was gone.",
"He said and wrote that he thought well of them, because that was his mind about them, and he said and wrote his mind.",
"It looks very bad.",
"It has been a very easy one.",
"They should every one be there!",
"Again the light!",
"Among them was her father, with a paper in his hand.",
"Does no one know me?",
"He never heard them, and he never moved.",
"So we went and got made man and wife.",
"And such a one am I!",
"I saw one of them.",
"I said that that was the view we took of it.",
"My time was short, and he began at once.",
"I do not know whether there is anything good inside or no.",
"Business cannot go on without him.",
"I cannot and need not say much more.",
"She looked as if she sometimes thought of that too, but rather in a different way.",
"She had for the time no answer to this question.",
"One word more and I have done.",
"That was before this one was built, and I put it in another place.",
"He turned away and left the place.",
"Of course one does not have to believe all that.",
"We left the building together.",
"I have myself seen her, as have many.",
"How comes it then that sometimes it cannot?",
"That was not quite so easy a matter.",
"The subject was new to her.",
"In many cases of the same kind the answer would be that the question is one which cannot be put.",
"She was happy when she was near him.",
"He did not ask her to go to his house.",
"They cannot get away from themselves.",
"So we took heart and went at it again.",
"Please do not think that I already know it all.",
"No life moved.",
"He was very much alone.",
"I tried again and again.",
"It looked easy on paper.",
"And I turned, too.",
"This would make it easy.",
"Talk the matter over with such an one.",
"I had had no experience.",
"Then they asked him to stay on for a few days.",
"Or am I trying to please men?",
"As it is, we do not yet see everything subject to him.",
"Night is coming, when no one can work.",
"Ask those who have heard me what I said to them.",
"Did not he who made the outside make the inside also?",
"And people went out to see what it was that had happened.",
"There is only one who is good.",
"On the law of works?",
"I can will to do what is good, but I cannot do it.",
"One night she had fine fun.",
"We were alone.",
"It was difficult to believe at first that there was so much food in all the world.",
"That is how it happened.",
"But she looked at me.",
"He has a bad heart.",
"I happened to be present.",
"My father was right.",
"It was a good experience.",
"I do not know its father or its mother.",
"Not an hour ago.",
"Answer me!",
"My father was an old man.",
"Much of it my father told me.",
"Were they what they seemed?",
"One of us is enough.",
"But nothing has happened more than once.",
"He takes no interest.",
"It would not please her.",
"I was one of his first patients.",
"I remember the place and the hour.",
"Nearly everything I have done all my life has been done for love.",
"It cannot, cannot be!",
"He turned about and went back the way that he had come.",
"The light still came from behind him.",
"Then he turned.",
"No one was there.",
"And leave they did.",
"The morning light showed nothing more.",
"Why, I myself have never been the same man since!",
"I am well, I am strong.",
"Should he leave it behind, where, at least, he would not hear and feel it?",
"He said I should bring him!",
"All are gone!",
"But ask her.",
"I must be with father.",
"I have been there myself.",
"It is a very hard one.",
"No one can be alone at home or in a quite new place.",
"I found myself a new being.",
"Children are certainly too good to be true.",
"If I could stay a month here, I should be as right as possible.",
"I cannot think him a man without women.",
"His head must be turned.",
"The book is good reading.",
"I should certainly be able to make a fine history of this.",
"Really it cannot be left out.",
"Some of it is not really bad, but the rest will not come, and I mean to get it right before I do anything else.",
"What fun we could have, if we were all well, what work we could do, what a happy place we could make it for each other!",
"I believe it to be good myself, even real good.",
"See what comes of being left alone.",
"In a way, I have found an answer to the question.",
"My wife is still not well.",
"Answer about the house.",
"But it will come soon.",
"It will be quite a fine work, I hope.",
"However, my heart is in the right place.",
"The rest is done.",
"And yet I am not happy!",
"That, and not the all of some one else.",
"This is a fine life.",
"Please let me hear.",
"If we could have had my father, that would have been a different thing.",
"I began to think I should not get away.",
"He is the note of the book.",
"All I ask is more of it.",
"All the rest are well, and I mean to be soon.",
"Please keep them very private, as they are for the book.",
"I want to be clear on one point.",

"To ask.",

"There was no one with the old man.",
"Not one of them had any present.",

"There was no one else there to give any to.",
"There was one and the same answer to both questions.",

["Yet, a moment later, it seemed that I could hear something.",
"What would happen?",
"I had her, and, greater than this, she had me.",
"I felt it last night.",
"Some of them were very funny.",
"One had felt it coming for some time.",
"Of course he was supposed to have had his own way in everything.",
"In a moment, the world changes.",
"But his true education is what he makes of these things.",
"There is a great deal more in business than the art of making money.",
"To do so is a social wrong.",
"She was determined that we should be very near friends.",
"But I had not a moment to think in.",
"The others followed.",
"I could hear one side of what followed.",
"As a matter of fact we so spent very few.",
"Now he was independent of me.",
"I had for the moment no particular place in view.",
"The action against me was well brought.",
"He looked upon her!",
"I am coming to that in a moment.",
"There was such a chance to study character.",
"Yes, my son, any number.",
"He had a positive wife.",
"I said nothing for a moment.",
"She followed him from room to room.",
"However, the first thing to consider was that she would see him today.",
"No price.",
"He felt he wanted someone else to be happy too.",
"I felt quite alone.",
"What price me?",
"Now the family felt free.",
"She brought them to her house and took care of them.",
"Now the men started running past her.",
"The others soon came running up.",
"A long talk followed.",
"A greater change was still to come.",
"This she did not want to happen.",
"There was one game we always played.",
"I am in college, and I try for one of the papers.",
"I had not played it for many years.",
"Not a moment was to be lost.",
"I thought my last moment had come.",
"Now came the important moment of his life.",
"I been watching her.",
"He felt of his face.",
"Never could have been less between a father and son.",
"The papers!",
"It began the term before last.",
"This is not my writing.",
"What was going to happen?",
"This did happen and more than once.",
"One of these was killed.",
"Be not too positive.",
"They drive every day.",
"There was only one chance left.",
"They simply expected it of him.",
"What is my life worth to me now?",
"These things do happen.",
"I know the writing.",
"It was a great deal to happen in a few years.",
"But he put his head out in a moment.",
"I followed her.",
"Did it happen often?",
"It was a great moment.",
"His news is worth a lot.",
"No funny business about our law!",
"They had not been to the meeting.",
"There is no further record of its performance.",
"It was a moment to look back upon always.",
"She is only an episode.",
"It was for that he had played.",
"She had lost interest, too, in the new house upon the other side.",
"Play, which is the business of their lives.",
"It is the primary book for school use.",
"The first primary work on the subject.",
"The chance once lost was lost for ever.",
"A chance to get killed!",
"Yet the events I have just related had worked a change in my life.",
"But in that hour I thought little of education.",
"As for me, I had found the chance I wanted.",
"Something did happen.",
"It was still very early, she supposed, and probably it might be hours yet before any one came to call her.",
"He knew in a moment!",
"I came to know after, or I never could have made this record.",
"Let the man go this moment!",
"There is no record of time in that place.",
"It was some time before I brought him to.",
"It had been so also on the previous night.",
"With these differences, everything seemed as on the previous night.",
"That there must be human agency, I feel sure.",
"Poor child!",
"We were not so near to each other as this, though we were father and son.",
"He said he heard I took great interest in this question, which had come so much to the front at the present moment.",
"And then in a moment it became clear to me what it was.",
"I could never, however, look on him as a son.",
"He took them and had them brought up.",
"There was very little to go upon there.",
"Why should not one friend give another an address?",
"He had nothing to go upon, nothing to show.",
"And would he, by chance, come down to look for it?",
"That was the way I felt it.",
"Here, then, is a capital fact.",
"I have read of these sounds.",
"I would have followed them, and then we should have known what they were up to.",
"It is too funny.",
"The rest followed his example.",
"My son!",
"There was not a moment to be lost.",
"I know my son.",
"We brought him here.",
"Many others, both men and women, have written me to the same effect.",
"And looking upon him in a while.",
"Only for a moment.",
"He wants to go.",
"He killed himself.",
"In the end, he brought me back into this room.",
"Who or what killed him?",
"Why had they been killed?",
"He killed a man once before, just as he killed this last one.",
"What was about to happen there?",
"It was all over in a moment.",
"Let him take what followed.",
"In this case it has killed sex also!",
"Soon after this a poor man came along.",
"But when he was not at work he spent his time in reading good books.",
"He was the friend of all poor people.",
"This was very hard for the poor people.",
"She killed some of them.",
"The men followed him again.",
"I do not believe they ever played in the water again.",
"He lost his money and became poor.",
"He had come to the house to spend the night.",
"At last they killed him.",
"But their father was poor.",
"But after a while he saw a poor woman.",
"She went into a poor little house.",
"He was very poor.",
"The family were now very poor.",
"Then she went to the court.",
"She spent most of her life at this work.",
"She did not like being so very poor.",
"She was thinking how poor her father was.",
"The idea of writing.",
"What are the results of these methods?",
"I mean their education.",
"It was then about one year since my mother brought me here.",
"Now and then one wants to know.",
"One moment more would tell.",
"What chance of that here?",
"I could not tell at the moment who it was.",
"In a moment we should know.",
"A moment after, he was gone.",
"At any rate, he has often tried, and now he was determined to try again.",
"Women have done their full share in the work of the community.",
"Another problem brought to us by women in industry is, how can we house them?",
"Then, too, she has it brought home to her each pay day that health is capital.",
"And the world is poor.",
"And then what will happen?",
"I was watching both her and her husband.",
"What he wanted was a positive result.",
"It may be the last chance anyone will have of getting it.",
"They had not been in court on the previous day.",
"But that was his last chance.",
"It was me that killed him.",
"I considered a moment.",
"I saw that he did not mean to leave me alone for a moment.",
"In a moment I saw why.",
"I should have to face the situation alone.",
"Consider her at every point.",
"All knew it, all felt it.",
"But what sounds?",
"Let me see the writing.",
"I felt that I had rather talk to him, at that moment, than to any other person I knew.",
"Let us consider them, and see.",
"A moment!",
"He had in his hand the thing that killed.",
"Another followed.",
"It had all happened in a moment, but the man was almost down.",
"The old call was strong upon him.",
"No response had followed her call.",
"In another moment she knew that he was gone.",
"That was his method.",
"But there was no chance now.",
"He had never known this to happen before.",
"What was about to happen would be fun for him.",
"Her husband followed.",
"Here is a story that happened once upon a time.",
"The child spent day and night with his mother.",
"I brought home much money.",
"The situation is very different now.",
"What will happen?",
"And it must not be supposed that he was left without any education at all.",
"He was back in a moment.",
"Consider a moment.",
"I thought for a moment.",
"I saw in a moment what had happened.",
"Let me consider.",
"There can of course be nothing in writing.",
"At last the moment came.",
"Poor little child!",
"Time was an important factor.",
"Discussion will come.",
"Yet it is really a great moment.",
"I followed.",
"The day of this interview was the most interesting I ever spent.",
"She may have written to her.",
"Did he believe that he had killed him?",
"Black art.",
"No one had supposed that they could yet be so near.",
"Poor children!",
"That nation will be hard to find.",
"I felt no such security.",
"Something happen.",
"Stay but a moment!",
"No, no, my son!",
"Even now his men are watching the house.",
"I have seen a son turned against his father, and all for a bit of paper which should never have been written.",
"Give him the paper, my son.",
"What was the price?",
"She was independent of me, of course.",
"That is for the law to determine.",
"Wants to see me?",
"Let us consider, for a moment, the difference.",
"When the war had been determined upon, they had to consider about the end of it.",
"Consider that last thought.",
"We all know what would happen to that man.",
"The word itself, if we consider what it means, will tell us that.",
"So it is in our present social system.",
"He was required to say whether he had written it or not.",
"This is the character of all life and being.",
"Let us consider this.",
"He left little to chance.",
"Let us consider these things.",
"It was the only true word written there.",
"I myself could live upon very little.",
"That should be enough to take care of him as long as he lives.",
"I drive it myself.",
"So I felt when I wrote it.",
"They are capital people.",
"Well, I was determined to have that system done away with.",
"During the meeting there was great order.",
"He was killed.",
"But I have said enough upon this subject in this place.",
"They had never really tried hard enough before that, because they simply did not believe.",
"Now there was a chance that he would not get back.",
"It had been a long time since he had felt so good.",
"Yet she knew how he felt about her.",
"A few miles will make no difference.",
"Yet it did not rest with him to determine the end.",
"He ever showed himself to be the head of the nation, not the head of a party.",
"Nothing can be more complete.",
"But I was somebody in those times, and could do something.",
"I was brought up in the country.",
"All the while she was watching his face.",
"And some of us know it all our lives.",
"It brought back so much.",
"And he went on writing.",
"He is always watching for the effect.",
"The poor man has had enough of it.",
"Every moment was against her.",
"It is our only chance.",
"Some lives are so.",
"It was his chance, and he knew it.",
"And they work in close relationship to the medical school.",
"But the place would be worth a lot to their work when they got it.",
"This town wants him.",
"He had nothing to suggest it.",
"But now there was no chance for that.",
"Down went somebody just now!",
"It was a chance.",
"It was worth trying at least, and he would go and see.",
"Another method.",
"But he had no chance to do it.",
"It only happened because her character is so good.",
"Everybody would think that something special had happened between the families.",
"It was the first time in her life that she had felt this.",
"As she did not look at all strong yet, the mother had led her there.",
"We all want to keep her here and she wants to stay.",
"If we knew where he is, we should have written to him long ago.",
"Now this is what will happen.",
"He also will almost certainly be killed.",
"Chance played its part.",
"Somebody asked him what was the matter.",
"I never saw him, but felt him.",
"And, believe me, if I am I am going back and get somebody for this.",
"Thus the states have been played against each other.",
"There were miles and miles of it.",
"Only consider!",
"They are all poor things that I know.",
"Look upon me.",
"We are a nation of changes.",
"I followed, and asked why he had done this.",
"All I want is a chance and a means!",
"I now felt this.",
"There was only one chance, and I took it.",
"It must not be supposed, of course, that there was no more war.",
"He soon found that the hand of death was upon him.",
"That will never happen again.",
"The most that we can do is nothing to what they are going to do for us, for their own nation and people.",
"And so many children poor?",
"He found himself running alone.",
"Are we being led?",
"I have lost my company and spend the night in the open with a few others.",
"But this year they came earlier, and in greater numbers.",
"The government has determined to close down on them.",
"The women of the country would be called upon to help, to do their share.",
"The moment made her a woman.",
"Anything might happen to him this day!",
"My chance in life is gone.",
"And he set about at once to act upon it.",
"Death for himself or death for his only son!",
"He tried to take note of his situation.",
"And then meeting me was too much for him.",
"Perhaps the moment had come.",
"The moment had not come.",
"It seemed that every moment he spent in her presence increased her effect upon him.",
"The moment had come.",
"All that he saw and felt became part of him.",
"He expressed nothing of what he felt, but all the others had something to say.",
"I know it the moment I come out to rest.",
"Miles away, perhaps, but close!",
"His moment had come.",
"She did not know how she felt.",
"Perhaps I needed somebody to point out the difference.",
"She must leave home, she must live where art could live.",
"Each one supposed that the others knew, and that there was good reason for his presence.",
"But we must face this situation as it is.",
"We have that one chance left.",
"The thing to consider now is how to get control.",
"There were some papers there, as well as a bill book.",
"Another followed it and another.",
"It is just getting a chance to make itself heard.",
"He was out of place and felt more out of place than he was.",
"Tell her to watch for the papers.",
"The papers were free to make much of that.",
"But she felt that the man was not playing a part, and that in another moment she would be alone.",
"And he knew that she was watching him.",
"She had seen them coming toward her across the miles.",
"If they once hear us we have no chance.",
"But that was but for a moment.",
"Poor father!",
"Of course he would phone before he came to make sure she was at home.",
"She did not always call him, of course, but he felt she knew where he had been.",
"They have ability of their own, but not that kind.",
"They want to do their share, outside as well as in.",
"We had to make a report of her address, and so I remember most of it.",
"Maybe he does not know the part he is playing in it.",
"It is often so in life, that people do not know the part they played until it is too late to change.",
"I read about him in the papers.",
"But he determined to stay.",
"But he knew that not a moment was to be lost!",
"Some day it must be written.",
"He had killed my mother.",
"I felt so happy.",
"It was very funny to see them going about the house together.",
"The men running about outside must have heard me.",
"It was very funny to see them.",
"I turned and followed it.",
"There was a light in the house, so I knew that somebody was getting up.",
"How did it happen?",
"He had not been brought up by mother or father.",
"Others followed.",
"I do not know who lives there now.",
"There is no place in this world for us poor women.",
"But for a moment nothing followed.",
"I have a son.",
"I have killed my son!",
"Consider them.",
"For what other social methods are there left to us?",
"It sounds old, very old.",
"The effect may be either local or upon the body as a whole.",
"This is supposed to be enough for common sense.",
"It may all happen in less time than it takes to tell about it.",
"In a word, he is the last word of mind working upon matter.",
"The whole world wants it.",
"People calls to people.",
"Funny old man!",
"I played with them all!",
"Like father, like son.",
"It is clear that they were written in old age.",
"I mean I was writing with my hand.",
"I guess he was played out.",
"I just followed them around.",
"I guess he thought that was funny.",
"Why do I talk, when the season calls for action?",
"It was on his mind, and he was determined to do it.",
"A week went by without another class meeting.",
"The water was brought.",
"Only chance.",
"Would her work be worth more to the world?",
"And did not he need the social life?",
"He has not written because he thought we did not care to hear.",
"Poor mother!",
"If somebody should come!",
"What could happen?",
"She could not make anything happen?",
"It almost killed him.",
"How she lives in him!",
"And how many other lives, who knew?",
"These years of writing had been a great deal to both of them.",
"He turned to his father, who had been called from the room for a moment.",
"He felt he had done nothing wrong.",
"Of what will happen after we leave this world, that at least we know in part.",
"Consider the story.",
"They do not want to be free, to be a nation.",
"We care not for numbers.",
"They would never have become a great nation.",
"My friends, all these things were written for our example.",
"And well worth reading they are.",
"But the years had gone by without another meeting of the men.",
"It was a very poor move.",
"From that moment his very ways of thinking would be different.",
"As soon as my back was turned, somebody took it away and put it out.",
"How funny!",
"This was but their second meeting.",
"Each family must have but one son.",
"We spent far too much money on it.",
"At least he will have a chance to live.",
"At last it was complete.",
"Only somebody told me this morning certain things, which I must make sure of, and think over.",
"But there is no evidence that it was that of the nation.",
"It is my son!",
"His love to me is nothing worth.",
"Have I brought her up to this?",
"There calls my man.",
"Who calls?",
"I will, my son.",
"Deal with her simply!",
"This was our chance.",
"No papers or books could be taken.",
"He felt sure of that.",
"He was short of something, at all events.",
"They generally do.",
"I thought I saw a man running.",
"There was no other method open.",
"It is certain, at any rate, that no lives were lost.",
"Let us consider the former first.",
"The term is, of course, not their own.",
"But to get back to events.",
"So he took the chance.",
"So he took that chance also.",
"They are poor people.",
"The men were running.",
"But there was nothing written for her to read.",
"It is like writing to music.",
"He was supposed to know, if any man in the world did.",
"What, else, were the families of the great to us?",
"Had we not reason to say, that the home of the very poor is no home?",
"It is good to have friends at court.",
"He started a new series, and increased the size and the price.",
"That which he calls I.",
"The cause, I think, is in the character of the people.",
"Many questions followed.",
"I spent the whole morning doing this.",
"Read the books I had brought at home.",
"The less is included in the greater.",
"These questions are already determined.",
"It will be as well if I give the address in this place.",
"Poor man!",
"I look upon myself as having a friend, another friend, taken from me.",
"But let us consider.",
"I think he would have let himself be killed first.",
"I drive her quite from my mind.",
"This was a thing to consider.",
"I have spent my money at home.",
"This side of her there could be nothing for either to close upon.",
"I turned upon him.",
"That of the woman child was social.",
"How did it happen.",
"So when they buy at all they only give about half what a thing is actually worth.",
"I knew him well and felt that he would understand.",
"He came in like somebody.",
"Real education he never had had.",
"What could happen to him?",
"And yet he knew that something was going to happen.",
"The situation is clear.",
"It is not a clear lead to the nation.",
"But what will happen to law and order?",
"I was going to ask a question here, but he did not give me a chance.",
"I felt sure that he had told her his story.",
"The next day she took us to see more of her friends, much of the same character.",
"We had a good meeting.",
"Friends really do not know what a poor thing I am.",
"The morning meeting was large.",
"But little was done at this first meeting.",
"This was their next meeting.",
"I simply know.",
"We were brought up together in the same country place.",
"His father and my father were brought up together.",
"Day by day I have read the papers.",
"Once more he felt the rest of her presence.",
"For my life I could not determine whether the news moved him or not.",
"I wanted to study art.",
"His chance had come.",
"One moment.",
"I remember the case well, because I read about it in the papers.",
"Yet he must have had papers and money on him.",
"He simply wanted to be alone.",
"How long had they been running?",
"It was their hour, as was the next and yet the one that followed that.",
"For what is the true life of a nation?",
"Art cannot show him.",
"Or am I poor?",
"Why, no, mother, he has brought me!",
"We are too poor.",
"He is a much greater name in history.",
"What I could do by writing, I did.",
"And I give the world what it wants.",
"I generally do.",
"We, my father and I, are poor, very poor.",
"How was he to address her?",
"I am a poor man, a very poor man!",
"My poor child!",
"And it is generally, always, in fact, money.",
"Poor people!",
"I am not poor.",
"The moment had come for him to tell her.",
"So they followed, and he went before them.",
"It was an education only to look at it.",
"They were so good to the poor!",
"And the second will perhaps be worth the first.",
"The present situation can last no longer.",
"We are not in the same situation.",
"They followed him.",
"They have been able to record it.",
"We must make our presence felt.",
"A discussion followed.",
"Let us not leave the field.",
"Up to that moment I had not thought of this.",
"This first day, which will be followed by others, is already complete.",
"He had often written to him, and had sometimes seen him.",
"They spent their first night there.",
"One was the father, the other the son.",
"Such a thing does happen.",
"Others came in every moment.",
"All were killed.",
"Perhaps the entire people, perhaps no one.",
"What was going to happen and what was about to become of us all?",
"We followed him.",
"They went back and brought him away.",
"We are the same nation, the same country, the same men.",
"They spent the night there with him.",
"New men, that is what they term them.",
"Let us review the situation.",
"Is the child being brought up by hand?",
"A moment later he heard something running away.",
"At last she hit upon a plan.",
"No less interesting than the man was the child he led at his side.",
"In a moment he was at her side.",
"I will be killed!",
"Then a change came upon him.",
"Of what else happened at this meeting I do not know.",
"It was a good meeting.",
"The man was there, and he would have killed me.",
"Miles are past.",
"There seemed nothing funny about it to him.",
"This, however, the factor did not know.",
"She had run many miles.",
"He thought over the situation.",
"I had no part in the piece at that moment.",
"In a little time a poor woman came along.",
"He was watching to see if I observed her, but I did not.",
"Such, at all events, is my experience.",
"And so it should be, if I only knew his address.",
"That is the point I am upon.",
"And that was why they killed the poor black man.",
"He knew not for the moment where to look or what to think.",
"Greater still would be their power.",
"Let us consider what it means.",
"It brought him some money.",
"It was funny.",
"But it was worth it!",
"I knew something was sure to happen to give us away, and something has happened.",
"Later in the season I went to spend a few days at the country home of his parents.",
"The next summer I went to spend a few days with my friend in the country.",
"Might not somebody else have done it?",
"She followed.",
"What chance had he?",
"The one containing the woman, or the other that came after?",
"Then let happen what would!",
"Was she but playing with him?",
"It was enough for the moment just to look at her.",
"He felt the need of no other.",
"What he had thought was of no moment.",
"Let her think that of him, for the moment.",
"Is this what he wants?",
"More than once she had felt it.",
"Soon, one of these told him, his chance would come.",
"Why had he brought her here?",
"There was, they felt, not a moment to be lost.",
"This he brought across the room.",
"Let me drive.",
"He saw his course quite simply.",
"This is the course which was usually followed during the late war.",
"It had come at last, the moment I had been thinking about for days.",
"I had followed the wrong men.",
"But the one and only way in which I could help her at the moment was to get away as soon as possible.",
"And I had to pay its price.",
"Is it worth the cost?",
"Give the child a chance.",
"The lives of these men have a quite personal interest for us.",
"Look upon me!",
"So they say, at all events.",
"He is worth more!",
"This might happen.",
"Stop now one moment, and think.",
"I cannot share in them.",
"She felt more.",
"No address here.",
"I can not tell how I felt, for the only thought that came to me was that I should get killed.",
"Many whole days I spent in this work.",
"Not long after this the people were very much worked up over the military situation.",
"I made up my mind that this would be a good chance for me to run away.",
"I knew that this was my only chance.",
"At any rate I got well, which can not always be said of all methods of treatment.",
"Give him a chance.",
"Behind it followed another figure.",
"The next month, however, brought other changes.",
"At all events, all I love is in this house.",
"Come in court, too, when he want.",
"Such was also the case as to what followed.",
"But this is only what may be said of any written language.",
"He received no answer.",
"When it did not come, she began to call, but received no answer.",
"But at what a moment!",
"She simply had to go to that.",
"Why not give them a chance?",
"At the same time she is determined to go on using it.",
"It was really quite interesting, and rather funny.",
"I felt it.",
"The written words I mean.",
"And he felt nothing, nothing at all.",
"He felt sure of that now.",
"Only it seems so funny.",
"She felt as if she had run a long way.",
"When I knew him his people were quite poor.",
"Somebody else must be up.",
"It was quite all right, she felt sure of that.",
"The example seemed to be popular.",
"But we were too previous.",
"Something might happen.",
"After all, he thought, perhaps the experience had been worth the money.",
"They looked at one another significantly.",
"He may suggest something.",
"So we want to work on our own methods.",
"So did I, and followed him.",
"They would have followed him.",
"That was never received.",
"Might is primary.",
"The fall had killed him.",
"It is a question of life and death with them that they should understand him and his methods.",
"There was still a chance for them.",
"Why should he not play his own game upon him?",
"In the first place, he could have an education.",
"It would be so easy simply to say nothing.",
"He supposed he had.",
"He did not stop long to consider.",
"But it was only for a moment.",
"He determined that the son should do no less.",
"They brought to her no good news.",
"Education of children.",
"Now, how low should a price be?",
"I certainly have the art of making the most of what I have.",
"I have the long drive home still before me.",
"But not up this drive.",
"She felt that the moment had come at last.",
"Note the effect upon the rate.",
"One hour of morning or day study is worth a much longer time late at night.",
"Take only a moment for this.",
"Time, he determined, should put that to the test.",
"It was from her son.",
"For the poor?",
"The moment seemed an hour.",
"We are all greater than we seem to each other.",
"It is killed they want to be.",
"The price he values not.",
"We had done playing for that night.",
"I have played him off enough, and have very little further use for him.",
"He that lives well, lives long.",
"It is not written for me, though to me.",
"So he felt sure she was on the way.",
"She has felt it many times.",
"He is worth so much money to me.",
"Poor things!",
"There was some writing on it.",
"Her face showed her character.",
"But there is very little chance, after all these years.",
"The drive was not a long one.",
"They followed.",
"And that was the funny part of it.",
"Once, poor little one!",
"It is for the poor.",
"She did not know, poor child!",
"That was a room, too, and this time it was funny as well as pretty.",
"Out upon it!",
"Out upon him!",
"Of death, my son!",
"Poor man.",
"I have no son.",
"I believe it will help clear up the situation.",
"That sounds hard.",
"This was all that was generally known of her history.",
"He gets what he wants.",
"So she was writing to him.",
"Had he killed her?",
"He had felt that it would be.",
"If she wants to tell me she will.",
"They had brought it about.",
"That is the very reason why this story was written.",
"The situation was too big for him.",
"For, consider my own case.",
"It did my poor heart good.",
"Then events began to happen.",
"We have no information as to his personal character.",
"But his real interest was in things rather than events.",
"But their method was a wrong one.",
"What is it worth?",
"Great events were then taking place.",
"Outside of this, they were nothing as a nation.",
"Particular people are never very popular people, just because they are particular.",
"The moment we saw it we knew it.",
"Rule of medical men.",
"General management.",
"Then it was not done by human agency.",
"That was the thing he had set his heart upon.",
"She felt made for that alone.",
"Each had its center of social and business and political life.",
"Why, think for a moment of the power of music.",
"But think a moment.",
"Since I had this experience, I hear that somebody else has related a similar story.",
"So I have seen a man killed!",
"They all go upon the same plan.",
"It was a hard moment for her.",
"The meeting was one of great power.",
"What little things turn great events!",
"The history of this day must be written.",
"On my part, before I was half through, I felt out of place.",
"The money was well spent.",
"Perhaps he was at home at that very moment watching her.",
"Something must, he felt, be done at once.",
"I have killed her!",
"She would share all with him!",
"At all events, he could but try.",
"Her work was not complete.",
"The address followed.",
"For a moment!",
"How nice all this sounds, does it not?",
"Poor little things!",
"So much for education, thought I.",
"It is simply a bad fact.",
"Consider this before it is too late.",
"She thought a moment.",
"What could the thing that was to happen to him be, after all, but just this thing that had began to happen?",
"There are a few points still which it were well we should consider.",
"The moment that I found the man and woman I knew them to be husband and wife.",
"He went again to the meeting, and he went again and again.",
"Poor woman!",
"Before he could say another word she had gone, and he felt that he should never see her again.",
"But it was worth it.",
"And right away things began to happen.",
"Not that this happened every day, but that it did happen.",
"What chance?",
"From that moment I was lost.",
"And we never knew, from moment to moment, what was going to happen next.",
"It is written in the books.",
"I say I am told, because I never read what is written in these days.",
"But, even as the close came upon her, so must it come here.",
"I generally know what that means.",
"I looked at it a moment.",
"I do not know what might happen to me if I were to leave.",
"We found each other, and for a moment that was enough.",
"We have simply to live our life, and the rest will look after itself.",
"It led into another room!",
"The next day, however, there was no chance.",
"That is my budget.",
"If I had written last night, I should have written a lot.",
"That will be a living book, upon my word.",
"But who wrote the review of my book?",
"He was a man who never found his method.",
"Not, in short, art.",
"Think upon it.",
"There must be something wrong in me, or I would not be popular.",
"It sounds very funny.",
"That is the only test I know of writing.",
"If it is not funny, I am sure I do not know what is.",
"This sounds like high living!",
"It is generally thus.",
"There is not much chance of that here!",
"Watch, watching.",
"Upon, above.",
"Bring it into court!",
"And there is hope for a nation while this can be still said of it.",
"What do we, as a nation, care about books?",
"I followed them.",
"I followed the old man.",
"I went to see some of them, and some of them received no answer.",
"They all looked upon me, not as a man, but as means.",
"And I felt that he was in the right.",
"I go to help the poor.",
"But who is the poor man?"],

["Yet it is no wonder if they are wrong, and no one knows his hour.",
"Below it, I could make out several others.",
"Beyond this, I could see nothing.",
"And, almost directly, came the morning.",
"For a time, I was at a loss to account for their presence.",
"There are so many things, about which I wonder.",
"Still, there is no sound.",
"The end every one knows.",
"He was an old man when I first saw him, and looked even older than his age.",
"There was none apparently.",
"He must have felt quite sure from the first moment that he would be named.",
"I was sorry to go back to town.",
"In no other sort of organization is this true.",
"What would we then lack?",
"In each community the church is like a living thing!",
"Who, indeed?",
"He takes a word here, a word there, common words that everybody knows.",
"At every step we have a choice.",
"If we did not meet with all that we had expected, it was because we had expected too much.",
"But to return.",
"I saw all clearly a few days later.",
"But within a few minutes the light had died out.",
"He was dead.",
"I had the key to this side of his character.",
"I had my hair cut rather close.",
"We were all below.",
"I took a step toward him.",
"No one paid any attention to anyone else.",
"Up to now there had been no sound.",
"Hold on!",
"No sound came from within.",
"He came to us almost dead.",
"Wait, however, a moment.",
"When we got to him, he was dead.",
"Let all get very hot.",
"Let get very hot.",
"Cover, let get very hot.",
"Going to church is a good thing.",
"Why might they not be the names of men?",
"How cool!",
"But hold!",
"Does not this look cool?",
"She held out to me her hand.",
"She decided they would do.",
"She was one of the few women who really can think, and enjoy it.",
"Far too hot.",
"She had not seen the man clearly.",
"He came in with his key.",
"Again, she felt sorry for him.",
"I wonder if I could guess her first name?",
"I see clearly at last.",
"They were friends as long as they lived.",
"Church time came.",
"The other people also kept still.",
"They expected to be killed when the chief died.",
"They were happy the chief was well.",
"Finally it was the last night of the visit.",
"I am a strong chief.",
"Maybe I will kill him.",
"Maybe I will not kill him.",
"They were having fun building the church.",
"We would not think it was such a fine church.",
"They went to the church services.",
"Maybe he is dead.",
"Many of her close friends died.",
"She wanted to go to other places.",
"We do not have the money or the workers.",
"I would visit many places which I do not have time to visit now.",
"But we need more workers.",
"But she wanted to go to a new part of the country and start more places.",
"Now her mind was full of new plans for more work.",
"How they were changed!",
"The mail came.",
"Here another service was held.",
"But hold a bit!",
"It is not necessary to say more.",
"Her hair.",
"He knows.",
"He held out a hand.",
"He kept his word.",
"They died for it!",
"Many are church members.",
"We can none of us make it out.",
"If we have to wait much longer the light will be going.",
"The dead man was not that sort.",
"He held up his hand.",
"Then I knew that I was there with a dead man.",
"He seemed determined to force his company upon me and I could not run away.",
"He died the next morning.",
"Every once in a while they would ask him some such question, but he paid no attention to them.",
"They would try to remember what the other man had said on the post next to them.",
"Thinking me dead.",
"She died.",
"Indeed I hear not.",
"Now this indeed is just!",
"And the life upon her hair.",
"I had done none of these things.",
"Her husband was the head of the church.",
"I wonder what will be at the end of this one?",
"He would stay and meet her.",
"She was very sorry for him.",
"Now there was nothing to wait for any more!",
"They simply looked, and lived.",
"She must wait until she was alone.",
"Dead man, he done.",
"Man dead.",
"Lack of work is just about as bad.",
"She was back again directly.",
"Then, for the first time since starting, he looked up.",
"No sound.",
"Late the following day everyone started up at a new sound.",
"He held out his hand.",
"Whatever it was he saw off there, he could not meet it yet.",
"Just wait!",
"Good lack!",
"Hold, hold.",
"How came she dead?",
"Is she dead?",
"Kill me.",
"That may do much indeed.",
"What, sorry for the news?",
"May I credit this?",
"Credit it!",
"Her hair, now!",
"The world held so much for him!",
"But it seemed necessary.",
"Paid his own way through college.",
"I am sorry that I was not here.",
"And what thanks did she get for it?",
"And it was my child that died.",
"I am sorry.",
"And I do not press it.",
"And all this is our basis.",
"Far from it, indeed.",
"Nothing would wait.",
"Then, indeed, all hope was given up.",
"But I had little choice.",
"But just then there came another sound.",
"They call me by different names.",
"The only good kind is the dead kind.",
"I ask no names.",
"He held out a long hair.",
"This was bad news indeed.",
"It is the way of some places with some men.",
"At last he made his choice, and so did I.",
"And they did enjoy it!",
"She had lived through almost everything that is to be found in life.",
"If she had died that night!",
"I am sure now that she will call directly.",
"But on this morning there were none of these.",
"She could not get over the wonder of it.",
"We cannot go back to live with them, or why should we have died?",
"There is no need to tell him anything, he knows.",
"There is something given to us beyond the others.",
"Indeed there was news of him through all the city.",
"We come and go where we are sent.",
"Sorry for some one else!",
"Where is the police?",
"I kept watch over him that he should not get away.",
"After all, it might not be necessary to come back.",
"My wonder did not last long.",
"But he was not dead.",
"He seemed to wait for an answer.",
"No, indeed!",
"Is it not so indeed?",
"What did he indeed do?",
"This post I hold.",
"No, hold!",
"But wait a moment still.",
"Like to talk to him, indeed!",
"Thanks again.",
"I do indeed.",
"The old man was dead.",
"I could make quite sure of that, wait for his death, and then enjoy it.",
"And the thing he held in his own hand?",
"But he kept still.",
"Even then, a very large volume was the result.",
"But this has now been changed.",
"I know of none.",
"Indeed I may go further.",
"But in the end the matter had to be decided by lot.",
"But we have some rights.",
"Our dead are not here.",
"They were all taken and sent to friends.",
"That is my favorite.",
"People call me a good many names.",
"All were apparently there.",
"Why have they such a force here?",
"Was it too late to write them?",
"Kill them?",
"She would have to give the chief place to the new wife.",
"He would have to wait in order to find that out.",
"Not a sound behind him.",
"He allowed him to work out the matter in his own way.",
"There was a change in her face now, indeed.",
"I sent him back to her.",
"They said everybody was dead.",
"Finally he was able to continue.",
"Something kept him back.",
"She decided that she would see how much he knew.",
"And, indeed, it did.",
"As for me, I was thinking of my dead friend.",
"There can be no question that both of them died from the same cause.",
"Tell them they must go to the police for their information.",
"Few people, indeed, put themselves out for it.",
"I wonder who she is?",
"She knows a good deal more about some things than either of us.",
"It was necessary that he should have control of her, and at once.",
"He had decided not to give her up.",
"She kept these little books after all the others had gone back.",
"For the moment words were beyond her.",
"Hold something under there!",
"Word must first be sent to her mother.",
"He knew that if he did not do what they told him to, they might kill him.",
"They did not kill him.",
"Some men write great books.",
"He never held any office.",
"He sent these books over all the world almost.",
"They sent them to various places.",
"He held it in one hand.",
"He took hold of her.",
"His father sent him to work in the field one day.",
"Then he took hold of it.",
"It is large enough to kill a man.",
"He lived in an old house.",
"He went home on a visit.",
"It seemed hard to risk the loss of all they had.",
"Years went by, and still he kept on trying.",
"Some of them died.",
"The sound came again.",
"But he kept on trying.",
"He kept on with his reading.",
"His hair was white.",
"He only kept on at his work.",
"Is the main figure effective?",
"There is none.",
"First, write the word down.",
"Which word suggests the more personal relationship with money?",
"She had bought the things she needed and did not know what to do.",
"His father was another sort, but he died, and the house is now well run.",
"I should be sorry, if it were cut down.",
"He came up to the church where the meeting had been held.",
"He held out his hand to him.",
"This was a loss for life.",
"Gone dead.",
"He was not dead, and she had leave to come to him.",
"He was not dead!",
"There was no one dead in it now.",
"If the key were only in it!",
"I wonder what it is.",
"For everything we give to her she makes a just return.",
"Why did I let my hair down?",
"The family were alone with their dead.",
"A meeting of the church?",
"She changed the subject.",
"There was no sound.",
"I used to wonder what this might be.",
"She is paid in kind for her work.",
"None would move.",
"I am giving my men all the rest possible.",
"None hit him.",
"He led the way below.",
"If he had done so, he was a cool hand.",
"He was quite an old account, if he might use the expression.",
"The police gave away nothing at the police court.",
"He felt him to see if he was dead.",
"And so he died.",
"The police must not know I was there.",
"At any rate, she did not get hold of them in the way she said.",
"And no wonder.",
"Light or no light, sound or no sound there was some one within.",
"And yet who knows?",
"It was the police.",
"It was bought when?",
"Something about a key.",
"No one knows.",
"Only one held their attention.",
"I hold it.",
"They tell me that this is of very choice quality.",
"Had it been held?",
"What followed, who knows?",
"She will see that when we meet.",
"I used to meet him late.",
"Nothing else in life seemed so important, for it did hold him back a little.",
"But a new word was necessary now.",
"All is clear to me now, and I must return.",
"I could not write much.",
"He will not want to meet me.",
"But I took none I saw.",
"Still there was no sound.",
"He would kill for her.",
"But something kept him from doing that.",
"He had expected him to return alone.",
"Then he heard a step outside.",
"And he knows that I love him.",
"He held his head up.",
"He had expected an answer, but none came.",
"It was his first big kill.",
"Sometimes both died.",
"She held out her hand.",
"Then she would wait for him.",
"A sound came to him.",
"But they had come to him dead.",
"Here he found a new wonder.",
"Every man in the room heard the offer.",
"None of the students paid for his living.",
"He lived alone with his mother.",
"He sent for him.",
"He found her dead.",
"She made the same offer to the others, and each one took her word.",
"Their mother died and he took another wife.",
"With such a force as we have here, it cannot be a hard matter to do about as we please.",
"Had he lost his hair then?",
"He was allowed to say no more.",
"They are not interesting enough to write about.",
"This must be looked into, for things could not be allowed to go on like that.",
"She may be a little hard to please, but after being used to one for so many years, it is no wonder if she be particular.",
"She had died when she was such a little thing.",
"He took me up as a mother might, and held me close against his heart.",
"There was room for only one thought in my brain.",
"Had my mother known, I wonder?",
"It was decided at once that I must go.",
"But I would not wait.",
"I had not long to wait.",
"He seemed to think me as good as dead already.",
"But that was not necessary.",
"Thanks, thanks.",
"But indeed, why few?",
"He had not long to wait.",
"I must be cool.",
"It was summer in a hot country.",
"Look, my dead child!",
"Go, meet them.",
"Perhaps, indeed, there are no words for it.",
"It is possible to value human life too highly, maybe.",
"Then I cannot hold her.",
"Of course, if times were different, one could enjoy music.",
"What is to be the issue we wait to see.",
"As far as he knew there were none left.",
"She went out to meet them.",
"But the dead return not.",
"This suggests a few words on a question of more than local interest.",
"But it was dead.",
"And no wonder!",
"Did I write this book?",
"I wonder who they were?",
"They changed there, of course.",
"I felt sorry for him.",
"Yet she never told us of where she had lived when a child.",
"There was not a sound.",
"I always felt very sorry for her.",
"But I did not press her for one.",
"The police must know nothing.",
"We continue to wait.",
"Especially after the friends are dead.",
"Cool off.",
"But this was not allowed.",
"It was not too hot.",
"They said he died before they could get him out.",
"But that will not be necessary now.",
"But it was not our town I had come to visit.",
"Indeed, I should have done the same myself.",
"He will get that paper if he can, if not by force, by money.",
"Why should they, of all people have paid this call?",
"I am sorry, almost.",
"It only remains to take my leave.",
"Indeed, it is their one hope.",
"Was it possible I was sorry to see the last of him?",
"I wonder.",
"I found none.",
"Apparently, the interview was at an end.",
"I did not meet her.",
"He did not go to the post office.",
"He also felt that the situation was rather beyond him.",
"He would wait no longer.",
"Hot stuff.",
"He was found dead by her side.",
"What are the police doing?",
"But, hold on.",
"By the way, I have a sample.",
"We must check it, of course.",
"I know he is not dead.",
"When he could get no credit he went without, and was almost as happy.",
"In several of these places the course was given.",
"He said that there was none in that part of the country.",
"It is necessary.",
"Why do we come to church at all?",
"They indeed are not out of place here in church.",
"What indeed!",
"That cannot be necessary.",
"He knows what is in man.",
"Somebody must enjoy the money, why should not I?",
"This, too, it may be added, is the case in other countries as well as our own.",
"The place is dead.",
"Who knows?",
"But for all that the most interesting thing in the town remains the church.",
"Of all this what remains?",
"In his day the church was still an interesting building, and he has left us an interesting account of it.",
"And he died.",
"Has to look over the mail.",
"Money was not as necessary now as it had been before.",
"So she decided to go back home and think it over, before taking further action.",
"That was a happy week, indeed.",
"It is well named.",
"She was dead.",
"I will write again very soon.",
"I could hit him off to a hair.",
"More of these things when I return.",
"I must wait.",
"He died the following year.",
"In him I have a loss the world cannot make up.",
"We had other places to see.",
"But he knows that the times are again us.",
"The sound was like nothing he had ever heard before.",
"Yet the sound had seemed very close.",
"It was the same sound he had heard earlier.",
"We meet at last.",
"It was the sound of a television set.",
"I only did it because I felt sorry for the poor little thing.",
"He died several weeks ago.",
"Why was the court decision held up?",
"The great man died.",
"But it was a wonder to me how she lived those last few weeks of her life.",
"The return home was made the following summer.",
"Would I were dead!",
"And now began this important trial.",
"And so indeed it was.",
"But before that we had long to wait.",
"What is its loss?",
"It was not, however, included in that collection.",
"One was dead.",
"He asked no money, and he gave none.",
"I am well paid.",
"What had she to offer this man?",
"He would enjoy them, poor man!",
"It may be that he is hard up and is to be bought.",
"And who are we that we may hold him wrong?",
"This was news indeed.",
"I asked no questions, and paid her the money.",
"Who was the dead man?",
"And still there was no sound.",
"He had paid for the education himself.",
"We cannot hope to hold this old place against them.",
"It is the first step, and it does not cost him much.",
"They will not allow me there.",
"This may be the last time we meet.",
"But he had nothing to write.",
"She was quite dead.",
"Thanks, my good, good friends!",
"Go meet him!",
"For the most part he would stay in the background.",
"They have everything any church school has, and probably more than most church schools, for what I want.",
"The church college showed the way.",
"Our workers know, in general, what is needed.",
"Some go to town, all right enough, but not to church.",
"He knows the line, and they know he knows it.",
"The women are the most patient workers I ever heard of.",
"But, I should say, schools.",
"But had it really paid?",
"It was a time of paper credit.",
"It was only a woman, and she dead.",
"I may be dead before morning.",
"If very large, allow more time.",
"Why can they have no free schools?",
"Who are to take their places?",
"Indeed, were it not so, how could they understand?",
"I will allow him to tell the story in his own words.",
"He knows everything that is going on up there.",
"I wonder where these children are.",
"But none followed.",
"This he could not enjoy now.",
"If it only had not been so huge!",
"It was, however, this man who always decided what was to be done with them.",
"But he was not allowed to.",
"I can clearly see that.",
"I know that she will find one there and apparently has found it already.",
"Yet who knows?",
"He knows too much for that.",
"That was not more than half enough to pay their board bill.",
"But all else had changed.",
"They are in the field, and we should help them in every way to be effective there.",
"There were none left.",
"Step up!",
"Hold, I say!",
"Complete in one volume.",
"Indeed I would feel so still if I let myself think of it.",
"I kept on before the men, though!",
"Not a sound!",
"What he saw required change he changed with a high hand.",
"So those said who saw the dead.",
"He now became a friend indeed.",
"Only thus, they tell us, can we hold our own against so huge a power.",
"I do not know, none of us knows, when or how this war will end.",
"Every one now knows it.",
"One question, the most important and difficult of all, remains to be asked.",
"Indeed, he has both described it and named it.",
"Why did I write?",
"Great source of day!",
"Not so the loss.",
"As time went on some of them changed their names to something else.",
"I often wonder how things get to be known.",
"I came up to visit them.",
"Lost, and his vote lost with him!",
"I began to tell her how sorry I was about it, but she would not let me go on.",
"Indeed, no one knew himself.",
"Now we know each other, and above all, each knows himself.",
"Man after man remains behind.",
"She had changed.",
"There was no further sound.",
"It was a country that, once lived in, could never be left.",
"There was no other sound.",
"No wonder many men were needed.",
"His big hand held her down.",
"She felt that they would meet again.",
"He decided he could think and plan while he worked.",
"I just wonder.",
"There were none.",
"It was a dead loss.",
"There had never been anything to force him to do it.",
"He was not sure he had heard a sound.",
"Then he died.",
"It had, indeed, taken the approach of death to change his hard old father.",
"He was indeed alone in the world.",
"What then, was his great loss?",
"They held him up.",
"She had died in that room.",
"I was not with him when he died.",
"But she felt that indeed she had become a woman.",
"That indeed was cause for interest.",
"He must be changed.",
"My father died a few days ago.",
"It was like giving up life.",
"I will have to kill that.",
"All the mail comes late.",
"None came.",
"They happened to meet the other day.",
"But she found none of these.",
"Indeed I am older.",
"But also I see beyond them.",
"I did indeed!",
"In about an hour we saw more clearly.",
"There are no free schools, and they have nothing to do.",
"I did not think it very sound.",
"This is the place, and now there is nothing to do but wait.",
"I could wait no longer!",
"Yet what difference, so he be dead.",
"How we are to act under such conditions will have to be decided later.",
"I want none of it.",
"There was one on board!",
"The fact is he might almost be dead.",
"Now I wonder if it could have been the same party.",
"Why the man was not already dead from that fall he did not know.",
"He did not press the point.",
"A man, a very big man, came to meet him.",
"He looked at her in wonder.",
"There was, after all, nothing to force her.",
"Just sent me word.",
"Meet me there.",
"Or, at least, I believe I am the only man who knows where they are.",
"But he held his words back.",
"Never a sound.",
"It is up to us to hold it.",
"He was giving her her chance.",
"How soon would he return?",
"But we are not going to wait.",
"There was but one possible answer, and in due course of time he came to see it clearly.",
"He began, saying very simply what he had decided must be said.",
"She would be dead.",
"Yet she kept on.",
"But they often went to the country and to other places where they had good times.",
"But who knows?",
"But something held him back.",
"I will write to them.",
"However, that did not need to be decided at once.",
"None of our people would do it.",
"I would wait for years for her.",
"The older man held out his hand.",
"Hold on, my father!",
"We have not the heart to continue the list.",
"I felt sorry for them, but the plan worked at once.",
"When I got older I asked her why she did not run away.",
"Indeed, I used to spend the greater part of my time in the house.",
"I was sure they would kill me.",
"There was no need for her to tell me the names.",
"But just then there was a running sound.",
"Apparently it was already dead.",
"No wonder.",
"Next morning his brain was right.",
"It was giving, yes!",
"But wait!",
"It is very necessary to do so.",
"And how were they changed?",
"If I am asked what that force was, I do not know.",
"Where does the brain come in, in all this?",
"They also have a low hair line.",
"But the general rule remains.",
"Its lack of power, however, is shown by the fact that I found it this morning in the brain tissue.",
"But just wait.",
"He held something up.",
"What next, I wonder?",
"May I stay and meet them?",
"Its first function must clearly be that.",
"On such a basis this war is a war to the death.",
"A friend in need is a friend indeed.",
"And that life was long indeed.",
"None, but good.",
"He never paid any attention to what they told him.",
"He happened to have a key.",
"So I kept still.",
"She had not long to wait.",
"My father may kill me.",
"Yet, since no work was actually required on this night, none was done.",
"No sound came.",
"And her hair!",
"I have lived in many places since.",
"She was full of plans.",
"Write to me and tell me how that is.",
"She did not make plans for her children as the other mother did.",
"And he says he will rest and write another book.",
"It was sent to the old address, I told him some one there would always find me.",
"Was somebody dead?",
"Wait for us to come.",
"The next summer he died.",
"And now what further remains to be told?",
"The president sent for me.",
"Highly important.",
"Beyond that we know little.",
"He sent them to do a work, and they did it.",
"Too like indeed.",
"Why, indeed?",
"It was a white world below him and above.",
"I lived with it.",
"But I changed my mind today.",
"As for taking any credit for himself, that idea never came to him for a moment.",
"But the most important stage of it was probably the first.",
"I should be sorry to say so.",
"Both were dead.",
"Indeed, I am all they have left.",
"I lived once for a little time, then love was taken out of my life.",
"Many thanks.",
"That, too, knows itself.",
"It held nothing else whatever.",
"Indeed, there was every evidence that she had.",
"But he had none to offer.",
"I, who kill myself with hard work!",
"But times had changed.",
"But she no longer paid attention to it.",
"Why had she none other?",
"Children indeed!",
"This, indeed, was what had happened.",
"One after the other they took my heart from me, and I lived only in them and by them and for them.",
"But then how could I hold out?",
"This was indeed true.",
"Since then the mother, having never asked for news, has received none.",
"No, no, this cannot be allowed.",
"Another step, yet one more, then another, and he would be before her.",
"Another step, another step!",
"It was necessary.",
"He did, indeed, come back.",
"And it was indeed this which had taken place.",
"She might, at all events, have sent somebody.",
"Who was dead?",
"A work such as this can only live by force of love.",
"But things must be set to rights!",
"And well indeed he might.",
"But exactly how great a force?",
"It is necessary as a part of government.",
"So much for the training of the sense of right and wrong!",
"If of the living yet the dead have care.",
"His force.",
"To kill himself?",
"Hold him, hold him, hold him!",
"I think it was so indeed.",
"Here be names!",
"I am sorry she knows it.",
"Too hot indeed!",
"It is indeed.",
"Knows he that I am here?",
"But no, he could find none.",
"Let her go indeed!",
"On the next visit it was the same thing.",
"He did not wait longer but went home.",
"Now, however, all was changed.",
"How were they to get them on board?",
"He can board for less than we can.",
"They did not think so, and he left, to go into business on his own account.",
"And nearly everything has yet to be done in organization.",
"The law is still living in the dead past which we have left behind.",
"And it is against the rules.",
"I wonder why!",
"My father is dead.",
"All turned and looked at him in wonder.",
"He took her hand and held it for a moment.",
"No one knows where to turn.",
"But she knew the rules.",
"These things, however, he kept to himself.",
"See, it is white as I bought it.",
"He cannot wait.",
"They know of none.",
"But how is he too changed with everything else!",
"None but the poor can do it.",
"See below.",
"Indeed, his health was never sound for long together after he became a free man.",
"See note below.",
"The man sent his car for us.",
"My hair was by then really long.",
"There were children from several schools already there along with their parents.",
"We now return to the war.",
"Of the name or family of his mother I find no account.",
"No mother knows the age of her own child.",
"Do write to me.",
"I am, indeed, in no want.",
"Return the list.",
"We have all lived long, and must soon part.",
"It is however older than his time.",
"But she paid her calls.",
"How long he had held it I know not.",
"By that time a choice must be made.",
"But none came.",
"The man who works by the day should be well paid, for he has to pay well for his living.",
"Take a day as a sample.",
"I have lived here by the week together.",
"How could I hold him back?",
"They were just as sorry as we, they said.",
"This decided the matter.",
"And what remains?",
"We must write to each other no more.",
"I seem to understand now how women have died of love.",
"No, he would wait a little longer.",
"I do not wonder.",
"I am not sorry for having done so.",
"Have the children no rights?",
"Has the wife none?",
"Let us see what it means, this first step.",
"Let us, workers, be clear as to what we are about.",
"But I had to make my choice.",
"My present husband knows nothing.",
"Her husband looked at his watch, and then held it with the face toward her.",
"But she did not wait for him.",
"But my visit is likely to be paid in a way different from any that have been made before.",
"One took a step and then the other.",
"Could he ever return to the school?",
"They are now dead.",
"She has told me as much, and she cannot have changed her mind.",
"He could only wait.",
"When my mother died I was left with nothing.",
"He, too, died.",
"His plans were all made.",
"There was still no sound in the building.",
"Her expression changed.",
"They had both decided it.",
"See me home, indeed!",
"She came a step further into the room.",
"Behind, her brain seemed to be working.",
"She died when I was a child.",
"No attention was paid to either.",
"When she died, when the child died, something died in me.",
"He paid no attention.",
"I had not seen the church yet.",
"Early next morning I paid him a visit.",
"The paper had then gone to press.",
"All good old town names.",
"But this is all beyond me.",
"Bought it there and then.",
"That may account for a good many things.",
"Then I found out who the dead man really was.",
"On second thought he decided to wait at least another day.",
"He would say as much and offer to return it to her.",
"It was hot.",
"He had seen enough and was starting to leave.",
"I have little more to offer from this century.",
"Or have I none at all?",
"Loss of friends?",
"The rest had none.",
"The times are changed.",
"At the end of this time she died.",
"To return to myself.",
"They never got beyond the second reading.",
"Who knows anything about it?",
"He did not open it, but sent it to his room.",
"I will wait.",
"I will go in directly.",
"She put out her hand, and he took it and held it in both his.",
"I have none.",
"It means the loss of everything!",
"And indeed he was.",
"There was only one thing he could do, and that was to write to her.",
"There is no hope, none whatever, for me.",
"I wonder who they are?",
"I am very sorry.",
"And so he was sent for and brought.",
"And he sent more.",
"He sent again for him and he came not.",
"I wonder what became of her.",
"It is now therefore time that I return to him which sent me.",
"And he named them, but none knew them.",
"It is kept all the year long.",
"They kept their word.",
"Sometimes he asked their names.",
"But where should they meet?",
"The police might come back at any moment, in fact they did come back a few minutes after I had left.",
"Who knows what might have happened?",
"Well, then, I will kill him.",
"Let us continue.",
"It was a new house, and he had only lived there a few months.",
"They lived on public death.",
"He held out his hand to me, and I turned my back on him.",
"I believe he is dead.",
"Must we continue?",
"There he died.",
"We did not know where we should meet again, or whether we should meet again.",
"To kill each other!",
"This said, I continue my story.",
"We held, however, one other meeting.",
"We did not meet again.",
"The people were indeed dead.",
"I always left the key outside.",
"It was necessary to go back.",
"By force.",
"History will keep an account of it.",
"Each alone knows why he has done this.",
"The head should be kept cool.",
"The above account is far beyond any thing that could have been expected.",
"We may now see what the plan was, when put together, from the following account.",
"But this is far from being the general account.",
"Here is, at any rate, a loss of their working time.",
"He had held out for a week.",
"Some one might be on board.",
"And did they kill her?",
"It names me, too.",
"When, when is this wonder?",
"At board?",
"At board.",
"We can never get beyond the range of cause and effect.",
"He found none.",
"He knew them very well indeed.",
"My blood was changed, I think.",
"I will have hot blood.",
"It was what he lived for as long as he could live at all.",
"He would make the trial!",
"They were beyond all reason.",
"Now all is changed.",
"Just how, he had not decided upon.",
"Then he will come and kill us.",
"He did not have to wait long.",
"They have not long to wait.",
"He had lived with them.",
"When will such a company meet again?",
"I said there was none.",
"I was with him when he died.",
"Here is one I will give as a sample.",
"I had no money to meet them.",
"We lived our lives within it.",
"She changed into a child!",
"She was directly within range.",
"Finally he decided what he would do.",
"This alone held him.",
"This he let drive with full force.",
"These he sent up first.",
"This cut the working force down.",
"At first he could see nothing much beyond it.",
"And, indeed, he looked the part.",
"Yet, wait a moment.",
"Now all that was to be changed!",
"The situation had got beyond his control.",
"Parents of all times and in all countries have done this.",
"Yet I rather think they would enjoy doing more things together.",
"Clearly, she was not a patient.",
"The child did not press the question.",
"Apparently he did not.",
"More than any other force in our national life, the children help us to work together toward a common end.",
"Likely story, indeed!",
"Her face changed.",
"He could think of none.",
"Work his way, indeed!",
"No sound!",
"Why had he heard no sound from her?",
"He was sorry for me.",
"She did not answer directly.",
"Money changed.",
"The church is interesting.",
"Seems he knows who did it.",
"Except for that no other sound came to him.",
"He knows that.",
"They could read and write.",
"But there was none.",
"Kill away.",
"She run out to meet him.",
"At the sound of her call, the man looked up.",
"She knows.",
"The figure was that of a huge man.",
"No sound had come to him.",
"None came now.",
"He had no choice in the matter.",
"General questions of training.",
"Not that I would allow myself to think that I could not get her back.",
"Be cool.",
"He said that he would kill me, and kill himself after.",
"I did not want her to wait.",
"Perhaps I should not be allowed to see him, even in the presence of others.",
"That idea had apparently not been in his mind at all.",
"Expression is necessary.",
"While this seems true in the main, I am not sure it will hold in every case.",
"And he changed the subject.",
"No, it was none of these.",
"He knows everything, and nothing.",
"To wait?",
"But I am left with little choice.",
"But there was nothing to account for it.",
"Sorry about that.",
"There was a man on second with none out.",
"He must see clearly if we are to see clearly.",
"Those were necessary.",
"I know what names are written on it.",
"He would not wait.",
"He held it high.",
"My methods have changed with experience.",
"He knows everything.",
"Go in and kill him!",
"I will write the cause of death.",
"Then let me go too, or else kill me.",
"And that she has good reason to turn against him, he knows too well.",
"What it may lead to, he knows not.",
"Of what use it may become, he knows not.",
"Everybody knows.",
"If it be so, everybody knows more than I know.",
"It must have been close below.",
"If he knows all about it, it is more than I do.",
"But all we have to do, I believe, is to wait.",
"Only wait.",
"She changed her mind.",
"Why, none.",
"None in the world.",
"But she kept on looking about the room.",
"Very few things were bought.",
"Still I kept trying.",
"I went out to meet him.",
"All was changed.",
"My mother died several years before him.",
"He has changed a bit.",
"It is very bad indeed.",
"Why, it is still none of my business.",
"Will held up the book.",
"What did it mean, indeed?",
"Meet party and go along.",
"Here he had lived since.",
"I am so sorry!",
"It cannot come from any other source.",
"He was very hot.",
"Apparently he did, for there was no answer.",
"Why indeed?",
"He did not want to think about hair either.",
"I am not allowed to.",
"What if they lived there no longer?",
"I could get up now if necessary.",
"It is only a step.",
"I wonder where she is?",
"Now he held it open for her.",
"She was sorry.",
"The things were paid for.",
"I say, give them the vote.",
"Here was chance being kind indeed!",
"He could not think beyond this fact, as yet.",
"He died a year ago.",
"She had only to wait.",
"He might be in church already.",
"He was not in the church.",
"She could not really have changed.",
"She felt cool enough now.",
"What else indeed was she?",
"Clearly something had happened.",
"She died during the night.",
"None whatever.",
"His brain no longer worked.",
"Who knows!",
"Still she held him.",
"But none of them turned up.",
"He kept on doing it.",
"The police did everything.",
"Have I changed?",
"For the present we must wait.",
"I only know that he was found dead.",
"There is much to do before we get to that stage.",
"We must go to the police.",
"Then, of course, the police were called in.",
"All the same, he knows something!",
"He sent it away.",
"But I know of none.",
"The world wants none of them these days.",
"They were held by what they saw.",
"As to the dead man, we left him where we had found him.",
"They were indeed.",
"What was to be given back, and what was to be kept?",
"And indeed it was.",
"We could say that he had sent us.",
"And wait!",
"But he was dead.",
"So the summer days went by, and he kept his thought in this matter, as much as possible, to himself.",
"There were not many people there, but they began to come very soon, and kept coming until the room was nearly full.",
"Indeed, there was good reason to believe that it might be true.",
"There was nothing to do but to wait.",
"Well, there was a law to meet just such a case as that.",
"A happy home it had been to him, a very happy home indeed.",
"I am very, very sorry.",
"He thought to wait here until help should come.",
"Now he could get through, and it would be none too soon either.",
"For a little time he thought that he was indeed there.",
"He did not wonder at it.",
"Choice of a wife.",
"Particular minutes to be kept of our studies.",
"I went to him directly.",
"I am very sorry I have no note of this.",
"I wonder, however, that so many people have written, who might have let it alone.",
"The church was all against this family.",
"A poor man with a wife and children now lived in it.",
"Had he written nothing else, his name would not have lived.",
"He said, he would not do it then, but perhaps would write one at some future period.",
"She was sorry to part.",
"Morning, at church.",
"Here we bought something, to remember the place.",
"I went to church.",
"When the money is once paid, there is little hope of getting it again.",
"Has the second post come in?",
"There would be nothing to write about.",
"What does she say, I wonder?",
"We find other groups named after their special use.",
"Here it remains until such time as it is needed.",
"All this may be kept up for several hours.",
"It was a long time to wait.",
"Now that the moment had come he could not wait.",
"She need not have sent more than one man to get them.",
"So we lived through the first year after father died, pretty well.",
"Yet there are good things of the kind here below, too.",
"I have lived so long!",
"He had died.",
"Some indeed had never been written down.",
"She died in an hour.",
"She asked what kept it from its rest.",
"The child died.",
"Those with their hair up are like this one.",
"Where he came from, none ever knew.",
"She had died some time before he came.",
"I am indeed.",
"The first step I would take, if left to myself, would be to find them out.",
"I wonder he did not.",
"He did not wonder, he said, to hear me say so.",
"To church!",
"I wonder not at either.",
"I write what I know has been.",
"Indeed he did not.",
"I called him by several very hard names in my last.",
"True indeed.",
"This the way we have been in for several days with the people below.",
"Indeed I think so.",
"He knows I have.",
"No wonder if it be.",
"None at all.",
"She kept not her word.",
"One might think them of little account just at first, but not for long.",
"Well, we will have to wait for mother, that is all.",
"She would return.",
"She did not hold back long.",
"Is it any wonder that they did not know her like that!",
"It was just the sound of the night after all.",
"One man bought a husband, another a wife.",
"Very kind, indeed, not to allow a mother to go and see her own children!",
"But she would have none of his company.",
"Then they decided that I was getting old enough to be told.",
"I wonder where he has gone?",
"There was none.",
"This was a very good answer indeed.",
"Else care will kill her.",
"Come, he is dead, else should we hear of him.",
"I wonder why her name is changed thus.",
"Indeed, I do not.",
"Hold, hold, hold!",
"As many died by me.",
"I will indeed.",
"I did indeed.",
"She now is where she never will return.",
"And no one paid any attention to him.",
"Indeed, they had quite another story to tell.",
"What can it all mean, I wonder?",
"There was another stop now, and a long wait.",
"I have come to offer myself for him.",
"I was to move about for a year, and then return to show what the world had made of me.",
"But I did not want to meet her just then.",
"A moment after she was dead.",
"What he would then do he did not know, except that he would never return.",
"He held out his hand, but she made no response.",
"She must be dead.",
"My heart was hot against him.",
"Our plans were soon made.",
"This is the source of the war.",
"But force is no right.",
"It can wait.",
"But the old man would have none of him.",
"And he was dead, very dead.",
"Perhaps they had lost some of their force.",
"I would, indeed.",
"Certainly he was sorry for him.",
"Hold still.",
"But he was not allowed to see him.",
"Indeed it was a great deal.",
"He did not even wonder why.",
"But she did not hold him.",
"He had lived quite long enough in the world to take care of himself.",
"He is going to kill me!",
"Meet him.",
"Then I went below.",
"Perhaps, who knows, they will last my time.",
"The basis of all was the same.",
"I do not know his plans.",
"If necessary to make love to her.",
"What were their names?",
"The names were not yet known, but they would soon come.",
"The stage management has been too good.",
"His plans were working very well.",
"Apparently not.",
"Now all this was changed.",
"Work, indeed!",
"But to return to our case.",
"The question is a highly important one.",
"Clearly it cannot.",
"The collection was too complete.",
"The church we name is not a very old one.",
"We have paid more than one visit to this meeting house.",
"A greater work has been done outside than within the church.",
"The music at the church is good.",
"But we must return to the subject.",
"Other rules.",
"Why so necessary.",
"They are, as I have said before, too hot.",
"He is dead.",
"The very character of the people seemed changed.",
"Thus a great step has been taken.",
"Who knows, who knows?",
"And now that she had paid, she would tell her all.",
"There has been another change of conditions through the development of political organization.",
"And, no wonder!",
"This was well thought of indeed.",
"Nothing more was necessary.",
"Then I have another source of hope.",
"Him has none of us yet seen.",
"Apparently no one was at home.",
"Really, who knows?",
"I enjoy it.",
"Indeed, she never had!",
"His step was light that day.",
"She knows not.",
"Happy are those who do not stop in the first stage!",
"I am really so sorry for him!",
"Or perhaps there was nothing to be changed.",
"One heart, one mind rules them.",
"Field was also on board.",
"Times had changed.",
"The first was the old class book that I had given him at the time of the organization of the class.",
"At the last named, he is at the present writing doing effective service.",
"But this state of things could not long continue.",
"The meeting was held in a school house.",
"We decided to go on.",
"So it was made the chief subject of discussion.",
"At the present writing he is on his second year at the last named place.",
"In social life he is a great favorite.",
"He heard none.",
"It did not sound as bad as I expected.",
"He knows it all, and more too.",
"The loss to the community, while very real, is little felt.",
"One for me, too, as is meet.",
"None she showed.",
"They do not wait for any city.",
"I never allow it.",
"None can tell.",
"I have given her the choice.",
"Would she were dead!",
"No one below had moved.",
"All that was changed.",
"Why force me to name it?",
"When would he return?",
"She alone has changed.",
"I will return soon.",
"To return.",
"Else I would have died first!",
"None comes.",
"I never expected to step into such a place.",
"Yes, indeed!",
"How is her hair most usually done?",
"Keep out of the way, indeed!",
"Here are their own rules.",
"They are on no account to hear the evidence.",
"Are there none such?",
"That did him good, directly.",
"Every one knows that.",
"How should I know who kept the house?",
"It was far beyond all price to me.",
"He kept it.",
"The place, however, is now quite changed.",
"I should have been very sorry to let him try his hand at it.",
"Being paid in money is nothing like so good.",
"People are always good company when they are doing what they really enjoy.",
"Well said, indeed!",
"It is not in any popular collection.",
"At this I cannot wonder.",
"I did not know, yet knew that all had names.",
"To know of a man that he is dead should be enough.",
"It was about the same season of the year, and at near the same hour of the day, of my last visit.",
"So he had lived since he could remember.",
"In that room his father had died.",
"He felt that she lived in a world beyond him, and he did not know what kind of a world it was.",
"What decided her to go?",
"What decided him to go?",
"I have lived on it ever since.",
"I should wait a month.",
"She has no house and no hold.",
"And I paid them, too.",
"As long as I kept my mind on it, nothing happened.",
"Nothing had changed.",
"It was too small a board.",
"Here, take my board.",
"It looked like a dead woman.",
"I tried to check myself.",
"Small wonder.",
"He knows what they are.",
"They gave him his choice.",
"I was a changed man.",
"Here is a sample of one.",
"And yet she held together.",
"I held on, and he held on.",
"I read through all the medical works on board.",
"Give us an answer for those who sent us.",
"The first took a wife, and died without children.",
"Last of all the woman died also.",
"And I will write on him my new name.",
"Of course, we were common men, and he was a chief.",
"One of them actually died on the second morning out.",
"Wait there then for me.",
"But this was not what decided me.",
"If I did, then would I have to return to this place again.",
"And I do not want ever to return to this place.",
"How is it with the police?",
"In the night of that day week, he died.",
"And what wonder!",
"A few days ago it was very hot.",
"Especially is this true of those who are dead.",
"I will write again soon.",
"I might have held her as long as she lived.",
"I cannot leave off going to church, but the support I want I must find out for myself.",
"It does me good to write them.",
"But she will return, and she will return very much as she went.",
"Sometimes, indeed, I think nothing at all.",
"Nothing, apparently, was changed.",
"She is dead.",
"I will none of them!",
"Small thanks for us women after our good looks be past.",
"That was indeed the number.",
"I kept well.",
"Do write some more, somebody.",
"Those who wait on me are not real.",
"Write here.",
"I like none of it, except some of my own.",
"Good news indeed.",
"Do write.",
"All these things return now.",
"Can it be got and sent to me?",
"I own, as I read, I wonder more and more why he should have taken me to be a friend.",
"We have no plans, and it is possible we may go home without going through town.",
"Please write to me soon as to this.",
"Have I any more news, I wonder?",
"But for all that, they tell me none want to leave.",
"Am I very sorry?",
"The mail after, anyway.",
"I cannot go beyond.",
"Where would this trial have to be?",
"I always held, but now I know it!",
"If anything be worth anything here below!",
"The mail is on the move, and I must let up.",
"That is my chief want.",
"A church.",
"A key.",
"Dead man, dead.",
"They have hot blood.",
"None at all!",
"So far as she rules, all must be right, or nothing is.",
"Type of true love kept under!",
"I had lived all my life out of town.",
"This house is huge.",
"I felt that it was necessary to say something to her.",
"Home, to the only home where she had lived so long.",
"Enjoy themselves!",
"Each woman knows this.",
"Must I write it?",
"A few things are kept in my room.",
"I am very sorry about it.",
"The room was full of people, and they all seemed very sorry."],

["There is no fire, it is dead.",
"I knew then that they were eyes.",
"Poor girl!",
"Perhaps, I should be able to learn, then, something of what had happened.",
"This must be, indeed, the beginning of the end of all things!",
"Each step that I took, seemed a greater effort than the one before.",
"There was no yesterday.",
"Another idea there was, that suggested itself to me.",
"There were many things said about it, and all were of evil.",
"This was all that we could learn.",
"Yet we can give it, one to another, or one man to the race.",
"Experience is what the race has been through.",
"This problem of control is a serious one in business.",
"What a man can study, I can learn!",
"Personal income and its use.",
"Nor was this all.",
"A small income, in that part of the world, goes a great way.",
"Next day came and we met again.",
"I felt myself a changed girl.",
"I could not believe my eyes.",
"My poor girl did so.",
"Nor did it last long.",
"No one knew where we were going, nor why.",
"It was rather a feeling of difference from the man I had known.",
"It was all very simple.",
"The process was evil.",
"Then there was a fight.",
"We gave ground.",
"We got to eat.",
"I turned over on my side so that my back was toward the fire.",
"He shot too soon.",
"What he was doing there I could not imagine.",
"He always worked in the open when the light was to be produced.",
"It was all natural as life.",
"And so are some other things serious, too!",
"That man never will learn.",
"Look it up, and send me word.",
"Now, dear!",
"I liked it.",
"The fact was, he had never even liked her.",
"Everything was there that she liked.",
"She would find it on her return from her walk!",
"The fact is, I always knew it, my dear boy.",
"Come along, old boy.",
"He went to the door.",
"She wanted to get more practice.",
"They liked her talk.",
"While she was working a boy came up to her.",
"They liked them.",
"They liked it, too.",
"The water at once turned red.",
"Instead, I met a white man.",
"Is there a scene like it in the world?",
"The boy made no comment.",
"Fire low.",
"My little boy!",
"Well, fire away and have it over with!",
"A good boy what can be good to a woman like his father before him.",
"That girl had sense.",
"Good measure, too.",
"I proposed to her there.",
"But, I imagine, without result.",
"He tried to imagine how the position had come about.",
"I turned and went to the door.",
"Yet I could not believe even then that anything really serious had happened.",
"There was something new to be seen at nearly every turn of the road.",
"I believe he read the answer in my eyes.",
"I supposed certainly that I would be the first man on the ground.",
"I met him soon after he got into town.",
"In the beginning only, he created.",
"In fact, I have been in those places myself when a boy, and I know all about it.",
"It seems so long since we last met!",
"What has it all been about, dear?",
"Their eyes met.",
"The child must eat.",
"Where is the poor boy to find another place?",
"Her income was gone.",
"The style of living was bad for him.",
"It is growing on her, too.",
"She liked it so.",
"He thought he had read his answer in her eyes.",
"Is it more serious then?",
"Within a different picture.",
"His face began to look a little more natural.",
"They produced no effect.",
"Yesterday this was full.",
"This was the beginning.",
"How could he send her home all that way at this time of night?",
"He felt her eyes.",
"Too much fire outside, and not enough in?",
"Except for that, good sort of girl.",
"He showed a picture.",
"Send him!",
"Fight it out!",
"Why, will he eat us all?",
"Gives him another part.",
"Away, and keep the door.",
"It gives them something to talk about.",
"It was very simple.",
"She was not feeling very well.",
"Take me away, my dear.",
"It had been her actual thought.",
"I had a little boy once.",
"Nor is it yet.",
"It is easy for us to find reasons why we should tell stories.",
"And animals?",
"There are not many of them, and they would probably learn more if they were left to themselves.",
"They know no social life beyond the family life, and family experience is relative to the size of the family.",
"But much direct experience must come first.",
"We must be quite clear about relative values.",
"The reasons for this are many.",
"A large number of simple experiments have been added, with notes relative to the work.",
"But there was a serious side.",
"There was nothing wrong with the actual idea of this plan.",
"She moved toward the door.",
"But the question is, are we ever going to pick up?",
"But that is only the beginning.",
"The girl did not look his way.",
"At the first note, the past came back to me like yesterday.",
"But it means the beginning of our business.",
"In time we came to the place where we had left our party, and it was easy enough to pick up their road.",
"Think well, my dear, for I will have nothing less than all.",
"When they do, it should be as simple as possible.",
"It was of the girl that they had thought.",
"Now, my little girl, tell me.",
"She has seen a picture.",
"My dear, we must take her away with us.",
"She was not in her room, she was in no scene she knew.",
"We have so many things to learn.",
"It would seem so natural.",
"They were dear friends always, and met often, but not again in the same way.",
"She could not tell how long it was, nor what was said, nor if it was in words.",
"They have known it all from the beginning, and it is a wonder to them.",
"They had gone far before they came to this new scene.",
"She kept her eyes upon them as she moved along.",
"Where my models were, there it came.",
"I can tell no man what his eyes said.",
"He saw none of us, nor thought of us.",
"What did she ask, looking at me with those eyes?",
"She looked at me with eyes that did not change.",
"How I knew that it was so I cannot tell, nor any man.",
"It may be there are such, but I have never met with them.",
"And he gave him his own daughter to wife.",
"They met, however, on the way.",
"My parents dear to visit, back I go.",
"Nor I myself will live alone.",
"But I often meet him along the road.",
"The door again!",
"On the other hand, it gives such free play.",
"For the sound of a car came from the road they had just left.",
"I could do anything I liked with him.",
"He would show no fight.",
"It needs no comment.",
"But the girl was not really bad.",
"Nor have we any reason to think that the first term in the series of these changes is known.",
"Could she ever be serious?",
"The ground is clear again.",
"No man can have more than that, my boy.",
"Something very serious came into my life that day.",
"The fire was now behind them.",
"Was he near the door?",
"But here another check met him.",
"Nor, left to themselves, would they have been equal to it.",
"I may be able to learn from some of his friends where he is.",
"This fact has often been noted.",
"The evil is even greater.",
"But the girl!",
"It was a simple but effective plan.",
"The contrast was too much for them.",
"It was not a common red.",
"Close the door.",
"It appears that I am wrong.",
"He turned without a word and went to the door.",
"He even took a step back toward the door.",
"I have a certain position in these parts.",
"Took the road.",
"Now tell me about this girl.",
"He suggested a man.",
"Still she met nothing.",
"Then we hit the ground.",
"I was never more serious in my life.",
"It was a long shot, but worth trying!",
"I have met him many times.",
"The old man turned this speech in his mind for some time.",
"She was past speech.",
"His eyes were open now.",
"Then the scene changes.",
"Then he made a little speech.",
"Their eyes were red.",
"Children were treated like little animals.",
"The general liked the kind little man.",
"He set fire to these.",
"He had never seen a picture.",
"His father knew every picture.",
"Night came, and they could not see to fight.",
"He tried to learn what other people knew.",
"They were also to tell about the animals.",
"But there were days when they did not have anything to eat.",
"Soon he would have a large fire.",
"He liked to see how things were made.",
"What should this little boy be named?",
"But most of all he liked to read about other countries.",
"He thought he would learn to like it.",
"There was one boy left in the office.",
"She liked what he did, and was sure that he would come to be a great man.",
"But he was still able to fight.",
"His head was toward the fire.",
"He liked books and papers.",
"He thought it would be a fine thing to learn to make them.",
"He saw a big boy coming toward him.",
"Every now and then he would tell that a little girl was lost.",
"So of our speech and our writing.",
"Yet that is what we must learn to do.",
"The evil that men do lives after them.",
"But this is not natural or normal.",
"How did we learn this?",
"The man was older than the girl, although he was not old enough to be her father.",
"All the same, he liked the man.",
"He knew the picture.",
"Then he turned to the girl in front.",
"Her son and daughter were not like that.",
"If I go, the line will stop running before the new men learn their job.",
"What if he met this man there?",
"They came close to the door.",
"The fire was not yet built.",
"A contrast suggested itself to me.",
"That is simple enough.",
"Was it a fire?",
"His government was simple enough.",
"So she set out on her walk.",
"Nor was it lost.",
"The case of a girl I met in a country town was common.",
"If so, what date?",
"He moved toward the door.",
"I will pick it up and return it to him.",
"I knew him by his walk, and by the look of him.",
"I followed the action with my eyes.",
"They were too serious for that.",
"No other suggested itself to me.",
"If so, it were well worth his while to know where that door led.",
"It looks like a short road into town.",
"She was a girl who only saw one way.",
"Break it open!",
"I had a key made to the little side door so that I could do it.",
"Was that a natural thing to do?",
"What was the feeling?",
"This is the room I went to, and here I built a fire.",
"My future looked very simple to me.",
"We were still to see evil days.",
"I was past all feeling.",
"I came to an open door.",
"It was the girl.",
"Then there came the beginning of the change.",
"And then the picture changed.",
"The fire was completely out.",
"Her one thought now was that they must have fire.",
"She came to open the door for him, and in a moment he was gone.",
"Something told him that the fight was over.",
"But the door was never open.",
"Then came the great fire.",
"The fire was very near now.",
"It was the picture of a girl.",
"But she would not eat.",
"Life and fire had not been there for a long time.",
"His eyes were red.",
"She would have followed him in face of fire but not in face of man.",
"A shot followed.",
"There was a red film before his eyes.",
"In the middle of these is a market.",
"The market is in the middle of the country.",
"He is a good shot.",
"One word from her would send the friends to death.",
"One day they met at the market.",
"She called her daughter.",
"They let her take the girl away.",
"A man had a boy and a girl.",
"Yesterday we worked all day to cut it down.",
"On the way he met a man.",
"Nothing could be more natural than such an idea.",
"Their fire.",
"It might go in at the eyes.",
"Nor was it very difficult after he found he must.",
"I can close my eyes and see it even now.",
"We will not be treated so!",
"No, father, nor in the middle of a fire either.",
"My daughter?",
"This means pretty serious economic pressure.",
"The trade goes on all the same.",
"It was a fine effort.",
"His men had put up a great fight.",
"The son was shot.",
"The majority of our own people, indeed, were in much the same case.",
"We move on up the road.",
"Nor is this all.",
"It looks now as though they would be equal.",
"He also said that he might probably take the place for next season, if he liked it.",
"Why, the door is open!",
"Every effort is being made to find her.",
"I got to know them, of course, and often shot with his party.",
"But there were good reasons.",
"The women appear to work more than the men.",
"The situation is serious.",
"The thing was not so simple as that.",
"I have seen some of those lines with my own eyes.",
"The situation now seemed well in hand, and a further break not at all likely.",
"They had never met, nor, I think, heard of one another before.",
"Here for some time the situation looked serious.",
"I told him no, not since yesterday morning.",
"Yet I saw nothing until I was nearly at our door.",
"Why should I pick my company?",
"The picture had changed.",
"It is growing late, my son.",
"Never be serious.",
"And the game is just beginning, my son.",
"Why, what must the boy be thinking of all this?",
"Out the door, men!",
"Never mind my reasons, or the thanks either.",
"Yes, I am growing old, my son.",
"Let us leave it there, where we can watch it before we fire.",
"Perhaps I had other reasons for going away.",
"Nor is it very kind.",
"Then came a break.",
"He alone was in a position to see through all parts of it.",
"None of the others now in his house had met her at all.",
"He took no notes.",
"He could not keep his great eyes from her.",
"The boy said he could not help himself.",
"Who knows whether my boy will return, or how?",
"The fight was about me.",
"He used to see the boy there in private.",
"The boy came to see her often, after that, to be sure.",
"We are not long in growing used to changes in life.",
"With the boy, it was different.",
"He sent me a picture of our old school.",
"She liked him.",
"Such eyes!",
"I used to like that boy.",
"Both of these women felt that their boy was changed.",
"My dear friends, remember these words, for they are true.",
"They war and fight, and have not, because they ask not.",
"And now, my dear friends, what has this to do with us?",
"By their experience we must learn.",
"We do not, the great majority of us, feel enough.",
"And what a road!",
"All that is simple, happy, strong, he is.",
"Her father came to the door with the check in his hand.",
"Pick up the board.",
"The girl could do little more to help him.",
"I liked the child from the first.",
"But never mind that, dear.",
"The man turned again, with no more expression in his eyes or face than before.",
"It was enough for her that her speech had set him thinking along new lines.",
"I hope this was not want of true feeling.",
"In this I am serious.",
"I am quite serious.",
"Such things as these need no comment.",
"But then I lost my head over a girl.",
"But the boy read it anyway, no matter that he did not understand a word.",
"He liked that.",
"The situation was critical.",
"No one met me there.",
"Such was the beginning.",
"I thought all this very natural.",
"He took her there, and left her for several weeks, under the care of a relative.",
"Her own account of the scene may well be given.",
"But I went, and soon found the good effects of a change of scene.",
"Nothing of the boy in him!",
"She is a dear girl.",
"It has been my trade, perhaps.",
"The girl was alone in the room.",
"But he did not meet her eyes.",
"She was not modern at all.",
"I have tried to put it into practice.",
"Tell the dear child that.",
"It will not come in our time, my dear friend.",
"This is the door.",
"Let him be treated as such.",
"He was not at all sure of his ground.",
"He is beginning to make it now.",
"She was quite serious.",
"We cannot send for help because we have no one to send.",
"That which had been white in his eyes was quite red.",
"He seemed to be making an effort.",
"The girl was looking at him with something in her eyes that he did not care to meet.",
"The girl did not answer at once.",
"I will be patient, dear.",
"There is no great nor small, no high nor low, in real service.",
"That was the beginning of many things.",
"Of late it had taken to growing, and a large part of its development had come during his college years.",
"So he must needs learn his own town all over again.",
"Both were bad, and there was not much middle ground.",
"Then just across the road to the church.",
"That thing is simple enough.",
"What they need over there is modern stuff.",
"Nor had he to wait long.",
"Before it is taken from the fire, cut off the head, and part that and the body down the middle.",
"Game, when liked.",
"Such a pretty walk it was, too!",
"Dear heart!",
"This kept her from beginning.",
"It is written in his eyes.",
"He is too old to fight.",
"My wife and children are dear to me.",
"They knew that efforts were still necessary.",
"There is no date and no place.",
"This is no figure of speech.",
"That is the scene most of the time.",
"Their trade was not war.",
"But this was only a beginning.",
"Why, it would be the beginning of a new order of things between us.",
"But even as I looked I saw them again appear.",
"It was now a race for life.",
"Particular care seems to have been taken against fire.",
"But there was now more serious business on hand.",
"It is not a war of race.",
"A development of this kind would be natural enough.",
"The reason for this I have not been able to learn from any one else nor to find out myself.",
"Because of their race?",
"They began to see how it might be possible to start another fire!",
"I went over to her when the official had gone out.",
"The walk began.",
"Nor was I wrong.",
"Every other thought, every other feeling has gone.",
"And what is the evil?",
"They fight and fall by the side of their men.",
"Still, she did not appear to be.",
"It might have been had not that girl come into his life.",
"No boy ever had more.",
"I sure gave that boy a good word.",
"Our women have got to fight, too.",
"There had been no beginning.",
"He allowed the girl to lead him back.",
"Something had to break.",
"In short order they put out this little fire.",
"It seemed natural.",
"And now he was a man, going out to fight for his country.",
"He was feeling great!",
"The moment was natural.",
"She was beginning to understand him.",
"The talk was low and serious.",
"She felt his effort to let her go.",
"Well, it was a fight, sure.",
"Tell him not to send me any more.",
"Blood and life shot into his eyes.",
"They all played their parts.",
"He could not close his eyes.",
"Could not that account for the sense of feeling lost?",
"Did he imagine the difference?",
"Nor did he imagine he put a great price upon his life.",
"But both were shot to kill!",
"His brain was on fire.",
"It changed her feeling.",
"I did not want to fight.",
"The last fight I had was with a boy.",
"They all fight.",
"He treated animals in the same way.",
"He looked as if he had been a good boy and would make a good man.",
"I walk about among them.",
"She told me I had good eyes.",
"Not every girl should go to college.",
"It looked natural for her.",
"Now the real fight was on!",
"Well, at the next town we could see there was something the matter with the animals.",
"I got a boy to go with me.",
"Nor did she know that.",
"Not once did he move his eyes from her.",
"It seemed to her that only now was she beginning to feel the effects of all she had been through.",
"After all, she was the daughter of his old friend.",
"She did not appear to note it until he had gone.",
"She came close to the fire and for a long time would not move from it.",
"It was a race between these men and those other men.",
"His eyes followed her step by step.",
"She tried to break away and run.",
"They gave him no time, no space for another shot.",
"She saw his eyes clear.",
"It appears so.",
"It does not appear that there can.",
"Or is not this also, one and many, whole and parts, containing in itself, things first, middle, and last?",
"Leading on high.",
"The last shot!",
"I remember very well when I first met him.",
"My family have no money, nothing eat.",
"Sometimes perhaps it might not be for a walk.",
"It might break with us.",
"He would send them to her.",
"All which is another way of saying that everything in life is relative.",
"She had seen it in their eyes that day.",
"His first thought was that it was a personal attack upon himself.",
"His mother a bad woman, his dear mother!",
"No, there was nothing serious.",
"Well, the women have a girl here who is going to do his speech.",
"She gave up her good name, to keep her boy.",
"During the day there was too much doing to have any thinking time, and, since he had met this boy friend, he thought of little else but him and what they were to do next.",
"The boy took me, and we set out.",
"Then I got them together, and had a little serious talk.",
"I used to tell him that he would kill himself if he could eat all he wanted to.",
"I tried to keep my eyes on the fire, but I could not, and just had to turn and look at him.",
"I should have shot him long ago.",
"When this talk was over, the president called for some stories of foreign animals.",
"Animals can tell each other things without saying a word.",
"Away we went again along a bit of level road.",
"Would no one help him to get his animals out?",
"It will break her heart!",
"Somebody was at the door of his cell with a key.",
"Some one came to the door.",
"The daughter came.",
"The race!",
"They met.",
"His heart seemed to break.",
"Her eyes looked him through and through.",
"I say, whatever equal rights men may or may not have, they have this right.",
"Let every boy, every girl, have an equal and sound education.",
"I have special reasons for it.",
"Is not that simple common sense?",
"Walk beyond the town.",
"Give it but time enough, and what would it not eat up?",
"Imagine it!",
"And so, to be sure, are differences between types.",
"One fact should be noted.",
"Yet the matter is after all not so simple as this would make it out to be.",
"All right, I see it on the fire.",
"And have a good fire.",
"But where are we going to eat?",
"That is the natural way of a man.",
"Nor do I.",
"My eyes!",
"My daughter!",
"Nothing could be more simple.",
"Down to the ground!",
"In this life we cannot understand our parts.",
"Again they met.",
"That was only the beginning of him.",
"First, I looked to see the date of the paper and I saw it was a couple of days old.",
"One thing, I knew I liked him a lot, that was sure.",
"Natural enough.",
"She was not a pretty girl.",
"We used to be good enough little players on a country school team.",
"It was he who started the fight, and only his word can close it.",
"But we made a strong fight, at any rate.",
"He started on, without comment.",
"I cannot believe, even cannot I fight.",
"She came to me one day with a very serious face.",
"But, in school, I write notes to another girl, to my mother.",
"And she could not break her heart by saying that she did not want her to go.",
"And in such a simple way.",
"We liked to write to each other.",
"Poor boy!",
"This is certainly a serious matter.",
"Parts of it will often go wrong here, and go wrong there.",
"A very natural thought.",
"He did not learn that, perhaps, at once.",
"For it is all simple and natural enough.",
"I can give no reason, nor any one else either.",
"That is actual fact.",
"He was beginning to get the full sense of the words for the first time.",
"It was beginning to seem possible that this man had done what he said he had done.",
"Any further pressure would end him!",
"That shows how simple he is.",
"That was a fight!",
"Her husband went to the back door.",
"He had no time to imagine further.",
"She went to meet the men in the middle of the room.",
"My dear!",
"How much, if anything, an expression of true feeling?",
"He went running down the road and was soon off and away.",
"Even the little girl became very red.",
"And nothing could be more simple or more necessary.",
"But would it not be necessary to send them the following year to a college, and where was the money for this to come from?",
"So it is all very simple.",
"Just picture him coming between us.",
"But another and more certain means suggested itself.",
"How long they were in going down to pick him up!",
"But, all the same, why not fight, why not try?",
"For a moment their eyes met.",
"But she was always strong, and her boy, it seems, looks after her.",
"I heard from him only the day before yesterday.",
"The picture looks different from every point of view.",
"But were they the only reasons?",
"In the beginning most probably they were.",
"Nor was that all.",
"From any higher, more international point of view, they are no reasons at all.",
"Yet they had, of course, produced their effects.",
"But, really, that is what is proposed.",
"Style is a matter of some moment, even at this early stage.",
"Where is my daughter?",
"Daughter, I come.",
"What, should we fight before we have a cause?",
"Boy, are we right?",
"Perhaps my daughter may first come to it.",
"Let the boy come.",
"Just what took place in the attack is known to very few.",
"No, nor for any thing else.",
"All of them but one, and he a boy.",
"Somebody must have set it on fire.",
"For my boy?",
"That kind of boy always comes.",
"They were probably all feeling pretty well that night.",
"Nor would there be any great interest in so doing.",
"What could the poor boy do?",
"Let her have it in full measure.",
"So are the trade and the schools.",
"It was a running fight.",
"For his eyes were close together.",
"His hair was almost red.",
"And then, of course, I thought it was a fire.",
"She has red hair.",
"They had not met for many years.",
"There is no door at this side of the house.",
"We can walk home to the school together.",
"He made no comment.",
"But he made no comment and asked no questions.",
"He was the only man allowed inside the door.",
"There was but one road.",
"He once said that he thought her pretty, and liked her hair.",
"It is red, everybody knows that.",
"I knew not players.",
"The cause was to come on yesterday.",
"It is natural to me to go where I please, to do what I please.",
"I find myself before a fine picture in a morning.",
"Old as I am getting, in his eyes I was still the child he knew me.",
"Now we can only pay our money, and walk in.",
"It was indeed a dead weight.",
"In the beginning, it was no problem.",
"The method was simple.",
"Met all my friends there.",
"Had to walk nearly half an hour back.",
"They do not study or do research on the animals.",
"He, therefore, brought together, from all parts, men above the common military standard.",
"There is a middle course.",
"Why should we walk there?",
"Nor no good either.",
"I have met with very few who would.",
"Something however I may perhaps learn.",
"I feel myself like a man beginning a new course of life.",
"I like to think of him in that last walk.",
"It said that I had come back to take up the practice of the law.",
"But this was not to be my walk.",
"I was about to walk out myself.",
"As to most of them we did not hold speech together.",
"Of these I learn when I play the game.",
"I went to the door of this room.",
"His eyes were for me alone.",
"Now her want was met.",
"The little man, however, was serious.",
"I could never imagine what became of them.",
"The boy got up.",
"The reason why this is so is very simple when we see it.",
"They have taken away my boy, and they have left little behind that I value.",
"Is not the example of the father as important to the son as that of the mother to the daughter?",
"Do we not all learn love so?",
"So it has been from the beginning.",
"And he is in the way to learn all this.",
"I am sorry that he ever made that speech.",
"But what has already happened gives little ground for any such hope.",
"The answer is simple.",
"I feel sure that the greater includes the less.",
"He is not met with a new situation.",
"A majority has no right simply because it is a majority.",
"I have lived in the world with my eyes open.",
"We must learn to be independent of every one of them.",
"I knew that I was playing with fire.",
"This plan was a simple one.",
"Every evil thing was possible.",
"She was a pretty girl with black eyes.",
"At last the scene changed.",
"I want to walk a little.",
"She saw me, our eyes met, and the story was told.",
"He did not even ask the one natural question.",
"See, I am going to close my eyes.",
"Her eyes followed his.",
"Now take me for a little walk.",
"That is only the beginning.",
"Her eyes were watching his face.",
"Then she looked away into the fire.",
"I am just beginning to understand.",
"What has really happened, dear?",
"Speech was a little difficult.",
"Then she made a short speech.",
"Taking this in her hand, she came back to the middle of the room.",
"A few minutes later we took the road.",
"Nor did we.",
"One day after date.",
"I thought of that door and the face of the man behind it.",
"His eyes seemed to ask a question.",
"He made for the door, and with his hand on it, turned.",
"Having once met, we had much to talk of, and it was a fine night.",
"I had reasons for not doing so.",
"And after that she never even told me anything about the boy.",
"The woman and girl started toward them.",
"Her eyes?",
"He decided to break it up.",
"They moved toward the door.",
"It is very different in style and language from any I have yet given.",
"This needs no comment.",
"What is my trade?",
"Dear night!",
"Nor is it difficult to see how they then find rest.",
"All too soon the picture was gone.",
"My daughter, my child!",
"Though it will not be an easy fight.",
"The girl turned to him.",
"I wonder how he will send it?",
"Very natural!",
"Dear me!",
"He had gone to that girl before he had come to her!",
"At the beginning, in the first age, the people lived long.",
"She was to him as a daughter.",
"It was a very natural feeling.",
"Then she asked him what he had seen and met with in the way, and he told her.",
"A second step, more serious than the first.",
"The first moment was a serious one.",
"These names should be noted.",
"The matter is as simple as this.",
"It is all very simple.",
"But for what date?",
"It was natural.",
"After a while the order for a general attack was given.",
"The beginning of the fire.",
"Why then should we fight?",
"He had been shot through the heart.",
"To have us shot?",
"Not one door was open.",
"A key was in the door.",
"There they shot them all.",
"It did not appear likely that he would have come to this.",
"No light nor air.",
"Nearly all of us met there.",
"In the other child, no change whatever was produced.",
"The first stage is the same usually as in the natural form of the disease.",
"Then a scene followed.",
"They came to the door of his cell.",
"He came one night to spend a short time with his daughter.",
"Fire, fire!",
"What fire?",
"How came this fire?",
"There, boy.",
"There boy, there boy.",
"Nor I.",
"I imagine it sometimes.",
"I liked to have him there.",
"Both she and her daughter finally decided that he must have met death.",
"There were fine things to eat.",
"The scene has changed again.",
"His face became very red.",
"They could not believe their eyes!",
"I think I had something of that feeling.",
"She knew this, and so did every one she met.",
"Then the door was sent back and put in its place.",
"I believe much was due to the expression of his eyes.",
"What a practice he had!",
"I was next asked what I proposed to do.",
"They met no more in this world.",
"Still, in the beginning, it was just a house!",
"It was not the place for such a fight for life as we were to make.",
"I suggested something of that sort to him.",
"But we were also beginning once more with just a house.",
"It is a fine thing to look back to the days when one was a boy!",
"He did not tell the man about the fire.",
"He had no idea of going direct there, however, that day.",
"It would be good practice in the way of experience, he told himself.",
"He went out into the road and looked far down it.",
"I saw them yesterday.",
"Good boy.",
"Never tried to get it away or fight him.",
"He took it, his eyes still on her face.",
"I cannot imagine my children doing that!",
"I am not so sure that her daughter will.",
"At the door she turned.",
"They followed me to my door in a body.",
"And mother liked it, and used to tell other people about it.",
"The home story hour is no less dear because there is a school story hour too.",
"Of course she is only a little girl, and she wanted to be like the others.",
"Among my child friends there is a little girl, an only child, whose father died not a great while ago.",
"The issue had to be met.",
"He liked to think of the picture.",
"What would the big types say?",
"Why did she not appear?",
"A girl looked up and saw him.",
"Why did she not appear now?",
"The girl turned her head.",
"But that would be only beginning at the end once more.",
"They asked what he was doing with his daughter at that time and place.",
"For the first time in his life he had been given the cut direct by a woman.",
"The girl was right enough.",
"The girl had read them all from cover to cover, most of them many times.",
"She liked him, as all women did.",
"Nor could she run away.",
"There would be a fight.",
"He would fight if he had to do so.",
"The girl said nothing.",
"They did not cover ground as this man was doing.",
"At first they could not believe their eyes.",
"The girl followed his eyes.",
"There was always the chance that the one who went first might get a shot in the back.",
"The right thing would have been to send him back again for her father.",
"Her level eyes met his.",
"They kept their eyes open.",
"Yesterday they give out completely.",
"And I was feeling.",
"I saw by his eyes, then, that he knew.",
"I kept my eyes on him, and I let them tell him everything.",
"Beyond that, he knows nothing, nor does anyone else except myself.",
"Every man and woman would walk out and get his money back.",
"I might learn something.",
"But even to their eyes, it was clear that this child was very special.",
"Of course, some people never learn.",
"The reasons for this are now known to us.",
"Now, go home little girl.",
"Nor do I especially care to.",
"Him might relative to me I.",
"It was really very simple.",
"The world knows how easy most things appear when they have once been done.",
"He has seen it, and we see it with his eyes.",
"But it will only appear what it is.",
"The means are simple, as the effect is simple.",
"But trade was good.",
"Send them away!",
"Send me in against him first.",
"It was simple enough.",
"I am on fire inside!",
"And, for certain reasons, it is good that it should not end here.",
"And such a study I have found in that of natural history.",
"Or were her own eyes new?",
"But the eyes of the picture followed her, and she liked it.",
"He was completely like his picture.",
"Any one could direct him, she should hope.",
"He was sure to like the place, already liked it.",
"We never met again.",
"Then he asked me if I did not want to take a little walk with him.",
"It was the beginning of the year.",
"He seems like a good boy, in the main.",
"The boy thought for a moment.",
"This was certainly something more serious than common.",
"All send love.",
"Liked her!",
"Something like order now began to appear among the men.",
"Nor was he a moment too soon.",
"I have been to the door.",
"Nor do I care more.",
"Do think of the dear little boy!",
"The boy will not return.",
"I eat at home.",
"I liked that.",
"It was the eyes, perhaps.",
"But it was not so simple as that.",
"The door began to close.",
"Poor little girl!",
"She will not eat.",
"She says she is quite well and indeed no one would think that anything serious was wrong unless they lived in the house.",
"Her measure will do quite as well.",
"A black feeling!",
"And now we have got to be serious.",
"It was of the girl wife she thought.",
"He felt eyes watching.",
"She had no sense of the evil of the world.",
"That very fact seemed to make the world less evil.",
"I had quite made up my mind that it was to be red.",
"But the time for speech had gone.",
"We have not yet told any one of the proposed change.",
"After all, he was no longer a boy.",
"But some one will have to pick them out.",
"He found the morning long, but that was natural.",
"The father shot himself.",
"We knew each other as boy and girl.",
"It may not be serious.",
"I cannot tell yet how serious the case may be.",
"She would fight her fight outside.",
"What she wanted was something simple and effective.",
"The thing was so simple!",
"Was that some one at the door?",
"They liked it.",
"She was such a dear little girl!",
"That was the beginning.",
"Her eyes turned from his.",
"The door was open.",
"Why, he looked the picture of health last night.",
"Nothing that they could tell suggested anything out of the common.",
"He was certainly not in practice here either under that or any other name.",
"This was for him a critical moment.",
"But they were equal to it.",
"And yet it was a critical time.",
"Economic pressure.",
"International court.",
"My only chance was to take this long shot.",
"I did not see it, nor did I learn where it came from.",
"It was the first direct question which had been asked him.",
"It will give us a base to start from.",
"But the cut, perhaps, was a more serious matter.",
"But there was a price to be paid for the feeling.",
"Dear things!",
"That we knew would be the road for us.",
"Our walk was only just beginning.",
"What if the boy were really in life?",
"This boy was his son.",
"I saw him only yesterday.",
"Where does the boy live?",
"It would be such a fine thing for the boy, he thought.",
"For a moment it seemed as though there was to be a scene.",
"These things I can only imagine.",
"He never knew before how dear the old place was to him.",
"She was still looking into his eyes.",
"He knew that his own situation was a critical one.",
"He went down and brought up the pick.",
"It was a pick.",
"They met no one.",
"The boy had gone this way, then.",
"She felt and knew that her boy was living and that very soon he would be with her.",
"Practice of the law.",
"I had not done this since I was a boy.",
"In the first place, he has very good parts.",
"The ground seems to be good.",
"The middle space was always open.",
"What chance would the boy have against a man?",
"A boy, indeed!",
"It is natural he should feel so.",
"I thought it would open her eyes.",
"With increased weight there is an increased amount of work to be done.",
"Ask the person to close his eyes.",
"Remember that none may do evil that good may come!",
"And the boy!",
"Simple children!",
"Perhaps he had just taken a little walk around the town!",
"He went out to meet it on the road, but he must have been told the words.",
"And he told him to come along with him, for he wanted him to fight another man.",
"Our little boy!",
"What do I want my boy to be?",
"Her reasons.",
"Has too much feeling.",
"I send this by a particular hand.",
"I can but try, my dear.",
"But indeed, my dear, this, or something like it, would I do.",
"What would the girl say?",
"Not one comment will I make upon it.",
"And so I have often and often told my daughter.",
"Upon my word, my dear, I do.",
"This evil then had not happened!",
"Well, then, we will imagine them on board.",
"He looked at the fire.",
"But he did not open his eyes.",
"The fire had died in the night.",
"But she did not come that morning, nor that day, nor for many days.",
"But he could not find the door out.",
"She would do nothing to help him find the door.",
"It was a long way to the ground!",
"This was a boy.",
"She held them off and looked into their eyes.",
"Of course, though, it was hard to eat.",
"It was her eyes.",
"The music is beginning to go on.",
"It is make or break with me now!",
"And that was a nice place to eat.",
"Come on back to the road!",
"They could just see a house down the road on the other side.",
"Her dear people!",
"She could not eat.",
"Certainly there was nothing left of her in the fire.",
"Same date.",
"And why, good daughter?",
"Come, daughter, come.",
"No, nor much good, I think, to great nor small.",
"Who is that at the door?",
"Therefore if he went to the girl now he was likely to lead others to her.",
"I want the girl home!",
"She made no comment.",
"She did not move, nor did she answer him.",
"But his wife would not eat them.",
"What a contrast between him and his friend!",
"The natural result followed.",
"It took me some months to learn their language.",
"I did not fire.",
"How base I am!",
"But though many a time he had speech with me, ever he kept himself close.",
"He saw his dead upon the ground.",
"The girl was watching his face.",
"She held the door open for him to leave the room.",
"Right through the door.",
"But he made no comment.",
"But that other girl now.",
"He looked at the door.",
"Or perhaps it was not such an effort, after all.",
"Open the door.",
"Even break and all that.",
"She did not turn her head when he came to the door.",
"The door into the other front room was open.",
"I got the ground in front of me.",
"For a long moment he made no comment.",
"My dear child, who can tell?",
"After the modern method.",
"He has a little girl like me.",
"That again was simple.",
"He was good enough to say that he would never have thought of this had I not suggested it to him.",
"The news came yesterday.",
"Yet when called upon he made a last effort.",
"The workers must fight.",
"It is a dear old house.",
"But there were other reasons.",
"Now, he did not go in at the front door.",
"Everybody liked to hear him talk.",
"But let us start at the beginning.",
"They will never give up this for the next, nor the next for this.",
"How produced.",
"I believe, however, that they may sometimes be made, but not for these reasons.",
"It is not simple enough.",
"She must love what she would have her daughter love, and even what she would have her understand.",
"They should never come much higher than the middle of the body.",
"It was the very thing he liked.",
"No, nor did he believe it even now.",
"The boy was off like a shot.",
"Nice girl!",
"He is not a bad man, nor is she a bad woman.",
"Keep looking at me between the eyes, please.",
"And it is this which gives it its value.",
"I hope my return to health will not cost me dear.",
"Before we give up the notes for lost, we must make sure, if we can, that he knows nothing about them.",
"At a church door!",
"It gives me none.",
"The moment she set eyes on me, she sent for her husband.",
"Will they fight?",
"I was beginning to make my way up.",
"The weight is nothing.",
"He would not learn what he did not like, and what he felt would be of no use to him.",
"He was, however, equal to his situation.",
"Look at that model of one over my door.",
"But this boy was not the kind that gives up.",
"I was a boy, however.",
"Nor would there have been any special need for a change, perhaps, if there had been no changes in the character of the work to be done.",
"Then a hand went over toward the other boy.",
"But she did not open the door there at the party.",
"Then he kept his eyes upon the ground.",
"But let us be serious.",
"In these last years he liked to go to church.",
"But government is necessary, and just because it is necessary therefore it cannot be an evil.",
"She had not set her eyes on him for a whole week.",
"It produced no effect whatever.",
"Where can the boy be?",
"Then he would set eyes on her no more.",
"Her room is on fire.",
"The blood shot up like fire over his face.",
"He said he read it in my eyes.",
"Now she must learn it!",
"I have my reasons.",
"She said she had his picture which she would show us some day.",
"My face become so red and white?",
"Dear me, of course!",
"But now let me go on with the story, for it has a sort of end as well as beginning.",
"It was hard work to give in, and he made a last effort.",
"And many and many a dear old day gone with him!",
"Nothing serious in life!",
"I imagine so.",
"It was not old and it was not modern.",
"How did he learn?",
"These events are treated so as to form a single picture.",
"A man can know no more about the end of his life than he did about the beginning.",
"Well, it was very simple.",
"Again she kept her kind eyes on him.",
"It was what he would have liked indeed to call it.",
"I tried to call the name of my dear husband.",
"That was direct enough, certainly.",
"Shot after shot now came from the front.",
"I did not know, nor do I now know, what might have come of it.",
"I saw, but was apparently not seen nor heard.",
"In what way, my dear?",
"What might not be done with such a girl as that!",
"The very same reasons.",
"She had not gone far before she met him.",
"He had changed much, and she knew it, but she did not know exactly how, nor did she know the reason.",
"It is very natural.",
"There were men and women from every walk in life.",
"And now, in simple language.",
"Nor was there anything else.",
"In the present it is a serious matter.",
"Nor was I alone in this.",
"It was the trade at last.",
"At any rate he lives the simple life.",
"Nor is this nice.",
"What a life she led the animals!",
"They will be where they are now, and they will eat out of our hand.",
"And he suggested I needed a change.",
"Our eyes met.",
"Her walk!",
"It was not the walk of a girl, but a woman.",
"People could and did live on such an income.",
"Please, please, dear, keep away.",
"He had suggested this before, when my husband died.",
"And I remember no more of that fight.",
"Poor little boy!",
"I liked him very much.",
"Is there a boy or a girl?",
"Where does he learn that?",
"What a picture is this of a nation!",
"And that was one reason, too, why I made my speech to them.",
"We are well past the middle now.",
"The actual is not the true.",
"I remember as a boy that there was some good reading there.",
"We had but a few days of him, and liked him well.",
"To send.",
"Child, girl, daughter.",
"To fight.",
"He gives.",
"To eat.",
"To break.",
"Bad, evil.",
"First of all, something about trade names.",
"I often met such people.",
"She had been brought up to live not by work, but by this life which was considered the natural one for her by those about her.",
"Sometimes she has nothing to eat.",
"He will see how I work, and he will learn.",
"But my whole life is evil.",
"This is so clear and simple!",
"A big well is near the fire.",
"The style of building has quite changed.",
"He is not a good boy.",
"There is a great deal to see and learn there."],

"They gave her the land to do this.",
"Although his eyes had looked longer on the world than mine, we seemed of an equal age.",
"It is wonderful that the party ever got there.",
"I could stand anything if I only knew.",
"I could stand it, maybe, if I only knew.",
"Not, baby?",
"Any day I expect he says is my last.",
"Why, the more, baby, I think of such a thing, the more I see it for myself!",
"Stand back!",
"Go ahead.",
"I wish he was going to leave.",
"Every one knew what this meant.",
"The question was, by whom and for whom it had been written.",
"It is a wonder that neither of them saw me.",
"I could neither see nor hear any sign of her.",
"I made a note of each day, so as to know the time when I might expect him back.",
"Learned as few are learned.",
"Whom have we here?",
"My beautiful one!",
"Always have a theory.",
"Who can explain these things?",
"The sign is down.",
"His road has not been a very easy one to travel.",
"Here, sometimes, it seems as if we had neither the one nor the other.",
"But land!",
"I hate him!",
"Was that what it meant?",
"Could she sell those!",
"There was nothing left her but to sell.",
"He had meant to make all right in a few years.",
"He had meant well.",
"For some time it seemed a serious question as to who would come out ahead.",
"We know where that would land us.",
"Never before was a fire made so quickly.",
"Fish, old man!",
"The woman turned quickly.",
"He started, and raised his eyes.",
"By whom?",
"On whom?",
"To whom?",
"But what will be the event of this?",
"And in good hands!",
"To be married!",
"As I could wish.",
"Neither of us have seen him.",
"Yes, wish a little more.",
"And I wish I was dead!",
"She was very beautiful, he thought.",
"That is why her hands are so cold now.",
"She took his meaning.",
"I wish I could do things like that.",
"I had meant to be kind.",
"Her eyes saw nothing physical.",
"But the world was not ready.",
"It is wonderful, but we have never thought about it.",
"I am old, so old, I can write a letter.",
"There is another side to nature work.",
"There is nothing that a man could eat or wear that he cannot get a good price for.",
"This was the signal for attack.",
"This time he did not require as much attention.",
"Otherwise not.",
"This was more than I could stand.",
"I was never at rest by land or water.",
"It was enough that I was going into a new land and new company.",
"To whom was I to turn?",
"At that we were all on our feet.",
"I was on my feet in a second.",
"That night I spent making ready.",
"He got to his feet and looked me in the face.",
"But now another meaning came into everything.",
"She neither saw anything nor heard anything, and yet she felt that some one was there.",
"She went quickly from the house, out into the night.",
"It was a great event in that place to see one come back who did not come by the common way.",
"She had meant when she saw his face to ask him to save.",
"She did not understand its meaning, and she had not any word to say to him.",
"I had no wish nor any power in me to go away.",
"He neither saw nor heard me.",
"Yet if it meant anything at all, what it meant was worth thinking of.",
"What had it meant?",
"Had it meant anything?",
"He was interested in it too, and wanted to know the view I took.",
"I have not even known what she meant.",
"Well, I have not seen any one whose energy was not equal to it.",
"It might be nothing, but, on the other hand, it might have a meaning.",
"I could make him do what I liked, say what I liked, sign what I liked.",
"He would neither get an answer from him nor find him, of course.",
"Knowledge of the work that is to be done.",
"Must the person know the meaning of the words read?",
"There are negative means and positive means.",
"But this is not my meaning.",
"It cost me just twice that.",
"But what is the sound at his very feet?",
"He started to his feet.",
"But she gave no sign.",
"Neither knew what it was.",
"But now the second signal must be near!",
"No sign.",
"There is no sign of a break!",
"How beautiful it was!",
"What had he learned?",
"She must act with energy.",
"Whom was she about to see?",
"This is a man who has been on my hands a good many years.",
"Whom could she send in her place?",
"I heard a charge that is not true.",
"No use to talk to men as a class, about anything but politics.",
"I have seen him lead a charge.",
"Otherwise, he would have used it before.",
"They were small hands.",
"Yet there was not a light, neither above nor below.",
"Still no sign of life.",
"What could she expect to find in him?",
"He went on, from table to table, from group to group.",
"The money is now mine.",
"Tell him to step right out here and get ready to talk.",
"At this she raised her eyes for the first time.",
"A light seemed to stand in his face.",
"What did they expect?",
"But now, think quickly.",
"I meant it.",
"Perhaps that was why he had never married.",
"I knew what he meant.",
"But the contrast interested me.",
"It was then that I learned his plan.",
"But it must be in her own hands that I place them.",
"No man can stand against him.",
"Would they understand how hard she meant to try?",
"It was a good theory.",
"Perhaps one may say that it remains a good theory.",
"There are a lot of them here for her to make selection from.",
"She got to her feet.",
"But if she said this, how account for the knowledge?",
"The girl in front heard neither of them.",
"I expect to live here the rest of my days.",
"All is now ready.",
"Then came some fish.",
"He paid them for all the land his people wanted to live on.",
"In that letter he told a story.",
"They began to get ready to go home.",
"He had learned their ways while he was among them.",
"There was not room for him to stand up.",
"They had to be carried out.",
"Sometimes they had nothing but fish to eat.",
"He thought he would like to travel.",
"The back of this letter had no writing on it.",
"When he was a baby, his head was too big for his body.",
"It was very cold.",
"She was ahead of him.",
"That night it was cold.",
"He raised his head.",
"He learned to read almost as soon as he could talk.",
"Let us consider the negative side first.",
"We might therefore consider either the individuals first or the groups first.",
"What is the central meaning of the word today?",
"What is their true meaning?",
"Would the man in the street be more likely to use one than the other?",
"Is the meaning exactly the same?",
"Nature has said it.",
"One felt this was a man whose word carried weight.",
"They must make the point and land.",
"Then, seeing there was no more to be said, she looked about.",
"He meant to hold out.",
"Half an hour more, and he would save them!",
"He thought he saw blood on his hands.",
"I wish I had done that.",
"I wish I had given him his life.",
"He raised himself at last.",
"There is blood on his hands.",
"What if his blood be on his hands?",
"I saw a letter.",
"She did not ask for the letter.",
"Where are the workers who will win the war?",
"Women are finding themselves.",
"Seeing neither, he knew what had happened.",
"Quickly he took in the situation.",
"Up went their hands.",
"There was no response to the signal.",
"The position in which the body was found did not support that theory.",
"I wish we knew which is the right one.",
"How I wish now that I had killed him when I had such a good chance.",
"They established nothing of the kind.",
"But beautiful!",
"Indeed, I did not wish to be so left.",
"I was seeing.",
"He wanted to show it to her, but it was too cold a day for her to stop outside.",
"I have not told any one, not even my husband, about seeing it on the road that night.",
"How many feet away?",
"Did I wish it?",
"Time meant nothing to me.",
"This brought her to her feet.",
"I had no wish for company.",
"This was the event of the morning.",
"It did not move, any more than mine did.",
"But its meaning came to me later.",
"With both hands she turned up his head.",
"Even the woman could not save him.",
"It seemed to her that she had never known it to be so cold in all her life.",
"It was the baby.",
"It was raised again.",
"It had but one meaning.",
"Nature had told him the one thing to do to save himself.",
"Nature had come into her own.",
"It had not interested him then.",
"They raised it.",
"I will not give it, save against my will.",
"It was an old woman, to whom he told his story.",
"When it got there, it saw money under its feet.",
"A poor man married his wife.",
"Here is the letter I have just received.",
"They were a long time without seeing each other.",
"He had a son whom he brought up well.",
"Wonderful indeed!",
"They do not wish to part company with us, nor do we with them.",
"I could stand it no longer.",
"We want a good many, for they wear out.",
"How could any of them be mine before I know the names of them!",
"I must go back a little to explain how he came to think of a plan.",
"Then we turned again to the group about the table.",
"When I think of them now, I think of them only as they were during that time, and wonder how many of the married people about me could say as much.",
"He took my hands in his.",
"And it was then that the great event happened which changed my whole life by giving me something to live for.",
"We were all upon our feet.",
"Well, as it was written, so let it stand, for my heart is in it.",
"We may yet win out.",
"All save one.",
"Well, a right hand is a little price to pay for the love of a wife like mine, and if I have made no name in the world, I at least live happy in it, which is perhaps a greater thing.",
"I was ready for death, but not at their hands.",
"How should this be, seeing that there is no such person?",
"And he meant what he said.",
"They did not wait to be told twice.",
"He had neither wife nor child, nor any one to think of except himself.",
"Our lots are near the trying.",
"Give it to mine hand!",
"It would almost seem that things could not well have been otherwise.",
"A friend of mine, who was in that war, told me the following story.",
"Because we had to wish it and could wish it.",
"It was a world event.",
"Where, in fact, do we stand?",
"But this letter is already too long!",
"Otherwise all is the same.",
"I wish she thought a little more of what is due to others.",
"One fact, however, we established.",
"I only wish I were.",
"But whom?",
"That letter was, she said, the last she should write to her friend.",
"Mine was therefore a fight for life.",
"Tell me quickly.",
"I have seen her once or twice.",
"I knew what that meant.",
"He did not know what that look meant.",
"They were of equal length, or very nearly so.",
"Thus it is certain that practice is of more value than theory.",
"But by whom?",
"At last human nature can stand it no longer.",
"One never quite knew what he would do, if left alone in charge of anything.",
"They had nearly all gone north.",
"But there was no sign of them.",
"He had almost given up hope of seeing us again.",
"He really meant it.",
"I turned toward him quickly.",
"I looked up quickly.",
"Why did he not sell it there?",
"The game was in my hands.",
"Stand up!",
"We have only one thing to add to it.",
"My father started and looked at him quickly.",
"For a moment her eyes met mine.",
"Her eyes had met mine again.",
"Then she told me she was married already.",
"Of course, it could not be otherwise.",
"He meant, and would live up to, every word of it!",
"Search would be made.",
"It cannot be otherwise.",
"No member of the public happened to be present.",
"I hate this place, and want to leave it.",
"She knew that those to whom he was going would do all in their power to make him happy.",
"The thing had been quickly done.",
"And human nature is the same in every age.",
"Of course there is more, far more, in this wonderful saying than we can understand, or ever will understand.",
"But from whom do they come?",
"Well would it be for married people, if they would but remember this.",
"I know that some think otherwise.",
"What is our knowledge of the world?",
"Look not too far ahead.",
"Where did it stand?",
"This was not an easy thing to do, nor could it be done at all quickly.",
"Upon the south almost nothing is left.",
"It is a most beautiful and interesting building.",
"And how little all this meant to him!",
"I have but to wish, and that is enough.",
"Stand to!",
"The money is mine, and the boy is nothing to me.",
"I have just learned that nothing will be decided this week.",
"I wish I could have written those lines.",
"I am much interested in him.",
"I wish it had so happened.",
"I read the letter to him.",
"See next letter.",
"I would not, that I know of, have it otherwise.",
"The letter is wanted, and I am wanted.",
"They were neither going in nor going away.",
"We called at another house in this street.",
"See how beautiful I look?",
"This was a particularly beautiful day.",
"He thought she had to be the most beautiful person in the world.",
"It was a beautiful thing he said to me.",
"If he could, there might be something in his theory.",
"Nature had done much for him.",
"His party was then ready to move on.",
"At last we gave the final charge.",
"What an event in life is this!",
"My father very soon married again.",
"She had never been married.",
"Such things sell.",
"How natural, how novel is all this!",
"They wanted to get along too quickly.",
"But she was then a married woman.",
"Please do not stand.",
"A learned woman is not of much account in the world.",
"The girl raised her face.",
"They had been married a month.",
"I am going south.",
"He came back to the table.",
"I am interested in my work.",
"She did not know whom.",
"It is much too cold to stand about.",
"And they hate us.",
"I hate her.",
"They did not hate each other.",
"I know that beautiful face!",
"We pay for that with our taxes.",
"He lives on the taxes.",
"There will be no taxes.",
"His face was set and cold now.",
"It was not now a very cold night.",
"I wish I was a man.",
"I wish I knew what it is.",
"Before long he found too that he was seeing a new people.",
"As soon as he came home again they would be married.",
"The event was now out of his hands.",
"But we must make them ready.",
"The room had its table, and on the table books.",
"Her place was next to his at the table.",
"Those organizations did me a world of good.",
"It is well for poor human nature that it is so.",
"To me they are only fine large words meaning nothing.",
"Never put the same water twice to them.",
"If the fish is very large, longer time must be allowed.",
"The act was simple and natural, but the result was wonderful.",
"This should not be made long before it is wanted for table.",
"The head should be kept cool and raised.",
"Many lives are lost by giving it up too quickly.",
"The cut part should be kept raised and cool.",
"I wish I could have such a chance!",
"Here is one theory.",
"We must keep our head in the one, and our hands in the other.",
"And how could it be otherwise?",
"He told them now that he was ready to take them all on a walk.",
"The mother was ready to go, too, now.",
"Everybody began to explain.",
"Nature will have its way!",
"Everything has to be learned.",
"She knows how his mother would wish everything to be for her son.",
"Therefore everything had to be made ready for the little patient.",
"That would seem a real crime in her eyes.",
"But he had quickly been lost from view.",
"She quickly took her hand.",
"They had both meant no wrong whatever.",
"All they had wanted was to quickly say a word to the mother through the open door.",
"She quickly went out.",
"So he asked me to take charge of things, as they were in my special field.",
"He raised his hands.",
"That I cannot explain.",
"Fire ahead.",
"Let me explain.",
"As soon as I learned what had happened I did not do either.",
"The fire department worked hard and did good service.",
"There was no sign of life.",
"When they were ready they came on.",
"I should never have thought that men could stand it.",
"Men appear, raised from their feet, and raised high in the air.",
"Can that kind of a man win a war?",
"Really, one would not wish to get behind so great a nation, nor yet go much before it.",
"What a happy lot is mine!",
"He gave information, and search was made.",
"So, throughout the day, they kept seeing each other out.",
"He might make and sell as much as he would.",
"Travel began again.",
"She has wonderful friends.",
"What do we stand for in this war?",
"But we never stand quite alone.",
"But I am interested to know what the children are thinking.",
"Knowledge, love.",
"What do we expect?",
"The money he gave them at once and the land not much later.",
"This is the nature of their function.",
"I knew what she meant.",
"The effect was beautiful.",
"He went into the house in search of something to eat.",
"Men do these things, of course, and women expect them.",
"There is but one, however, that I need now explain.",
"But I learned too much there.",
"Otherwise I could take over the land.",
"She felt something she could not explain.",
"She had to drive the cold thought away.",
"But she wanted to cover her face with her hands.",
"She had learned something new in these few days, and that was to hate.",
"But she gave no sign and moved away.",
"She had meant what was beyond him to understand.",
"He did not mind the cold.",
"His big red hands worked.",
"He had meant to do it.",
"It must be, then, something that he did not wish her to know.",
"He held up his hands.",
"He took her hands and held them close.",
"It is beautiful.",
"I will be neither.",
"I wish that would come true.",
"I lost some hours finding him.",
"It was beautiful.",
"Feeling like mine then only comes once to a man in his life.",
"That was their meaning in life.",
"It meant a charge.",
"Look for a charge!",
"That meant death.",
"But it seemed only a physical state.",
"He had found out all of physical life.",
"His hate had gone with his blood.",
"It seemed so simple and natural that it could not be otherwise.",
"It might save him.",
"Could that land mean as much to him as it did before he went to war?",
"What would be beyond seeing them in life?",
"We found her at home, though apparently just ready for a walk.",
"The view from it is, of course, beautiful.",
"A beautiful place.",
"That was what he must signal.",
"It was my plan to get him into my own hands.",
"In fact this could make little difference, for it was not likely he would leave me alone for any great length of time.",
"I had no time in which to explain, or make clear the situation.",
"I could not do otherwise.",
"We expect that in our trade.",
"Send me word the moment all is ready.",
"Everything was soon ready.",
"Of course after that it was up to the other to tell them whom he was.",
"An answer quickly came.",
"And from whom?",
"I am ready to go at any time now.",
"On the way to the street he looked again at his watch.",
"She was more and more interested.",
"She was cold.",
"He came quickly to meet her.",
"I hate him.",
"Yet there was that in their expression that made him understand that she was not looking at him, the physical man, so much as through him.",
"And I meant it.",
"But he was far ahead and did not turn.",
"Certainly he gave no sign.",
"For the first time he saw what it was that she held in her hands.",
"For again he but said simply the thing which he meant to do.",
"His hands were almost on her.",
"For neither is it this alone.",
"This is the nature of that country.",
"They are nearly all night workers, finding the days too hot and white.",
"The land had called him.",
"At some future time I will explain the cause.",
"He did want so much to win!",
"My mother was a big woman, and I always thought her very beautiful.",
"In fact he does not know just how things stand.",
"She read the letter over and tried to picture what it would mean.",
"His wife can sell it over his head, or will it away, as had sometimes been done.",
"They knew it well, and the people had learned it from them.",
"How could it be otherwise?",
"He learned to eat the food and to like it very much.",
"His father came and went, finding the boy so happy and well that he left him with an easy mind.",
"We wish that everyone could study them in full.",
"I thought then that I never had seen such a beautiful girl, and I think so still.",
"Try to feel interested in them.",
"He was never allowed to be too hot or too cold.",
"After a time he would take it to some city and sell it.",
"I thought it was a beautiful place.",
"This was the boy whom we saw on the way there.",
"The next time father brought her in, he got ready for her.",
"We saw that as soon as we got on to the main street.",
"I could not stand it.",
"I never wish to look upon the like again.",
"They were beautiful!",
"To whose charge then?",
"She is so beautiful.",
"It is mine.",
"So that theory will not do.",
"This is our first theory.",
"I believe the former theory to be the true one.",
"That is human nature.",
"Poor human nature!",
"But that is neither here nor there.",
"Which will win means which will will.",
"The physical changes followed.",
"In that case I might as well stand for it.",
"Land, child!",
"The international situation at the present time is beyond question the most wonderful that the world has ever seen.",
"Our leaders say so, and we believe them.",
"Now save me.",
"Beautiful watch!",
"Many hands make light work.",
"Most wonderful!",
"Twice was enough.",
"I knew well enough what he meant.",
"That was just how quickly it happened.",
"Neither is anyone else.",
"Seeing them was one thing and getting to them was another.",
"But I was ready.",
"Anyway, I was ready.",
"She had not meant to go so far.",
"He was now ready to fight with all the force that there was in him.",
"Page, put to the vote and carried at once.",
"How much they learned from their books that night may have been a different matter.",
"To stand up, so they can be married over again.",
"But it runs in my head all the time.",
"Let it come quickly.",
"The boy had learned her eyes by heart.",
"I lost so many of mine by growing up too soon.",
"My father gave her to me when I was married.",
"I wish I had!",
"Are mine too long?",
"How could he stay his feet?",
"I wish I had a home of my own.",
"And she was a member of the church?",
"What had her mother meant?",
"I wish I could live as he wants me to.",
"He had learned to write as she had learned to talk.",
"The notes were not on the table.",
"It is most wonderful.",
"Natural, indeed, to wish that we were back again in the old times.",
"More learned we may become.",
"True, to whom little is given, of them is little required.",
"Because it is a law of nature?",
"But upon whom?",
"This is very wonderful.",
"And yet again it is not so very wonderful.",
"It was the second great event to him, all in one day.",
"He wanted to land me there.",
"He was seeing everything for the first time.",
"He let out some of my life, but he let in a lot of knowledge.",
"By seeing one it was possible to imagine the other.",
"We might expect as much.",
"It is the only way, this plan of mine.",
"It was, at all events, strong enough to save her from being shot during the war.",
"The next time I feel the call to crime, believe me!",
"What did she wish him to believe?",
"For he had learned this much at least of life, that everything is always possible.",
"Well, he gave no sign.",
"I had to take them for use in event of need.",
"Now they were ready to start.",
"Perhaps he himself might be able to help in getting the child ready.",
"The baby would not live a week in such a place.",
"He made his wife a sign that it was indeed time to take leave.",
"She has her business, and I have mine.",
"She must have had a letter about it.",
"But what can one expect?",
"By love alone can one create.",
"I wish to question that woman myself.",
"And what could they set upon the table?",
"Was it still possible to save him?",
"Yet this is human nature.",
"When, and by what art learned?",
"The fact does not seem to be clearly established.",
"And that of course could have only one meaning.",
"It was at this point that the question became one of international politics.",
"We do not definitely know.",
"It is not even, and it is not beautiful.",
"No more than may with right of reason stand.",
"That lived mine.",
"Whom see mine eyes?",
"Well, boy, then I will add one more to many.",
"To whom is it?",
"With whom?",
"Neither saw we him.",
"Mother, make full my wish, and be it so.",
"And he asked her, were they not married?",
"Neither too large nor too small.",
"Neither did she say a word about how long a time he had given her to pay him his price for it.",
"The fish was done to a turn.",
"He seemed particularly interested in that game.",
"Come and see these fish.",
"Let their crime be brought home to them and to the world.",
"These features were not of recent date.",
"Yesterday, and ever since history began, men were related to one another as individuals.",
"He might have meant much or nothing.",
"He went out into the cold air.",
"Perhaps she never meant to.",
"It is a question of politics.",
"And I hate school.",
"But I expect he hit him back again.",
"He could stand between her and the world.",
"It is the point to which all men travel.",
"They were going to make a stand here, as would seem natural.",
"Indeed I should expect it of him.",
"Was it ever otherwise?",
"She was by nature a good child.",
"How I found my feet, I know not.",
"I wish we could get at the private history of all this.",
"I wish every book I have were so noted.",
"This is the only reference given for it.",
"There is enough of it, yet I must add a few more lines.",
"He told me which fish had died.",
"It is not always that there is a strong reason for a great event.",
"Another letter.",
"I am otherwise pretty well.",
"It is rather wonderful that so much has been done for me.",
"The letter was then produced.",
"I have raised many of them in one night.",
"She had no word of mine for it then, nor had she now, and I believe she felt rather certain there never would be any.",
"So has mine.",
"She found her picture in his dead hands.",
"I went down again, for the room was cold.",
"Her mother had told me this definitely.",
"I thought it must be mine.",
"He had never married.",
"This room interested the girl very much.",
"She carried a book, but did not open it.",
"I wanted it to add to my collection.",
"Here my father and mother were finally married.",
"The boy looked at his hands.",
"There was neither answer nor human form.",
"But I cannot explain myself.",
"Down charge, I say!",
"To whom little is given, of him is little required.",
"It looked well enough in theory, on paper.",
"I should have thought that that was a sign of a lower state and not a higher.",
"I need not say from whom it came.",
"I must go to her feet.",
"But so it is throughout the world.",
"Save me from them!",
"And he is just about to be married, too.",
"What I expect is that nothing of that kind will happen.",
"In order to save one being, he may not kill another.",
"I have not given the letter in full.",
"But we must try to win the majority.",
"I wish to go for the time being into the why.",
"How could I do otherwise?",
"Of this there is no sign.",
"In any case, I do not wish to live much longer as I have been living.",
"She has often said to me that I do not look a day older than when I married her.",
"He must have married soon after I left him.",
"The man to whom I gave it had no right to keep it.",
"The girl could not be made to stand still for a moment.",
"The business was of a most important nature, and sometimes very trying.",
"They went away and left him alone with the dead and the baby.",
"It could have been the most wonderful thing in life.",
"She is by way of being under my charge.",
"They neither of them moved.",
"Think instead of all the wonderful things we are going to do.",
"He seemed very little interested.",
"Twice I have taken her.",
"There are some things of mine up there.",
"There was a man once who wrote a letter to a certain woman, which I found.",
"She lives her life, I live mine.",
"It was a new world growing up around him and within him, too beautiful a world to leave.",
"I had every reason to hate him.",
"At once she put her left hand into mine.",
"Is she married or single?",
"But, good land!",
"What followed took place quickly.",
"But, always, I meant to turn, if I got the chance.",
"We neither of us asked a question.",
"Next day we both went north.",
"The men present held up their hands.",
"Whom could he do?",
"But seeing who he was with.",
"She had learned.",
"How beautiful the world!",
"She did neither.",
"It was the first time they had met at the table.",
"He was able to travel and he did travel.",
"I know where I stand!",
"Others will think otherwise.",
"Mine eyes could tell me?",
"His feet were like his hands.",
"Even nature seemed to have no place for me.",
"The light of the new day was cold.",
"He could not go there with his letter.",
"His speech was in answer to one of mine.",
"Anyway, mine did not!",
"She raised her eyes again, and let them rest on his.",
"And how I stand!",
"Here is the letter.",
"I wonder they stand it.",
"Wish it was me!",
"I think they are working very quickly.",
"We have well seen the country, and it is good to win.",
"But he was not a man whom people would leave alone.",
"How beautiful they were!",
"And by whom?",
"Not finding it, he went away.",
"And whom?",
"The situation is without resources.",
"This street is of great length.",
"On the right there was a small street.",
"It was carried.",
"That is mine.",
"They did not know either with whom they were or where they were going.",
"It is a crime.",
"It is very cold.",
"What was the meaning of it all?",
"He felt them search him.",
"A letter to a woman.",
"They search him.",
"I do not wish it.",
"To save him from a crime is to save him.",
"At length it came.",
"It was a simple sign.",
"One fine morning it saw them come out of a crime.",
"Nature has her own methods.",
"I have had no thought for any one save myself.",
"She is beautiful, too.",
"Then he began to search the lower part.",
"He met many old friends to whom he was kind.",
"Art ready?",
"They hate me cause I would but live.",
"And what to read mine?",
"Let this our last will stand.",
"Be mine eyes lost for ever.",
"Whom then?",
"Of whom?",
"In every walk in life, book knowledge is only a means to an end.",
"They were people, he now said, of whom he should not have thought at all.",
"Well, so there is to mine.",
"There came no letter, and after a while he sent nothing at all.",
"How I hate the day!",
"And she married in course of time, and so did he.",
"I learned that later.",
"Nature does not make such lines.",
"And there are many other things as wonderful.",
"And so they were married.",
"All was ready.",
"Who said that the water was cold?",
"She was as beautiful as ever, but she seemed more human.",
"She had only good in her heart in all she was planning to do.",
"The man could not have been killed more quickly.",
"It was wonderful.",
"He thought this having charge of things all by himself was by no means bad.",
"He put the baby down on its feet and started to run with it.",
"But there came a change, for which he was not responsible.",
"I cannot even now explain how it was done.",
"I leave others to work out this problem of human nature.",
"Then there was an insurance policy to keep up.",
"All I had to sell was what I could write.",
"All I did have was the wish to own a home of my own.",
"It had been built to sell.",
"He felt as though some wonderful thing was about to happen to them.",
"Her person, how beautiful!",
"No amount of energy will take the place of thought.",
"Stand in the ways, and see.",
"I have lots of good friends here.",
"There was one letter the boy kept.",
"He tried not to see what I carried.",
"And how we worked getting ready for them!",
"Some of the children whom I have in mind as I write go to private schools and some of them go to public schools.",
"Neither did I say anything.",
"He heard words but they had no meaning for him.",
"But why did she wish to?",
"And they were, quickly.",
"To whom would he be taken?",
"Were they, perhaps, married even now?",
"He brought together his hands.",
"Again that ready response from her!",
"She raised her eyes.",
"On the back of that wonderful man.",
"This road cannot be called beautiful!",
"So far as she knew her mother had never been married.",
"The evidence was in his hands.",
"Instead of giving him the key, she put it down on the table near his hand.",
"It has actually become physical with her.",
"Indeed, she knew that he would go through fire to save her.",
"He meant to take her.",
"No table.",
"Far and near were words which had no meaning.",
"He would not take a human life to save his own.",
"There was no question of travel.",
"They went ahead and did it or died trying to do it.",
"At least, whatever might be about to happen, she had it in her own hands now.",
"I knew of what she was thinking, and of whom.",
"I meant not to come.",
"I thought quickly.",
"But it was too late to wish.",
"She did not mean me to find out until she was ready for me to know.",
"I meant to get there.",
"I had a plan, and knew how I meant to play the last hand in the game.",
"But I was ready to fight now.",
"Things get out of focus, and the sense of values is lost.",
"Art is the beautiful way of doing things.",
"To win all we must give all.",
"However, that is neither here nor there.",
"Still, it was a matter that would require a bit of research.",
"Me not like hate.",
"It really is about a friend of mine.",
"We have a wonderful time together.",
"Twice a week in the summer.",
"Otherwise it cannot come.",
"Could he have done otherwise, he would not.",
"Not many could take what I gave him and be on their feet again within the week!",
"It will save my friends.",
"What a night for travel!",
"Of that war they see neither the end nor even the plan.",
"Let me explain it step by step.",
"But how was it raised?",
"In politics the case is the same.",
"They were alone at table.",
"They left the table.",
"She married him just before he went.",
"In her hand was a letter.",
"And I guess living so is one reason why I want to get married.",
"This rule was carried out to the letter.",
"It was a great event.",
"I raised her husband and I would not separate them.",
"In other words, action must do the talking and explain everything.",
"He read it twice.",
"If she once got interested in a person, she could make everybody else interested.",
"One day he came across a beautiful little story that he read to them.",
"Neither said anything, however, at the time.",
"I never knew that he was married.",
"At the moment, however, he did not wish further to press the point.",
"At present, I can think only of the risk he runs.",
"Thinking twice about it!",
"This has neither.",
"And do I wish it?",
"What was now to come of her beautiful plans?",
"A letter left for me told me that she was going away with that man and would become his wife.",
"That we could not understand it might be rather to the credit of the book than otherwise.",
"Neither did he go away.",
"Twice only had he seen her.",
"The other raised his hand.",
"Except that she would like to wear it.",
"And she was in his charge.",
"He began to feel interested.",
"And I got everything ready made.",
"I know what she meant.",
"It meant decision, and decision meant action.",
"It might be well if she were married.",
"Mine is very large.",
"It is an old letter, I think.",
"But it is a real love letter.",
"I mean, from whom?",
"But it is a beautiful letter.",
"I have no letter.",
"She was not really interested in the letter, now that she had got it.",
"If life still held something beautiful for him, why should he wait?",
"We were married.",
"There was lots of room.",
"And I do not expect ever to love him.",
"I wish it were only that.",
"I think she is getting to hate me, too.",
"The old life would be definitely over and done with.",
"She was to be married then.",
"So she could not get married.",
"Neither found anything to say.",
"They looked neither to the right nor to the left.",
"How many feet?",
"Leave it in my hands and think no more about it.",
"Exactly what I wish.",
"I wish I could get a word with some of our men who really know something!",
"However, there this knowledge was.",
"One of them interested me particularly.",
"There was a wonderful lot of them.",
"Should the fight run to its full length, it will, of course, be decided upon points.",
"He had learned something.",
"If I were to fall into his hands?",
"But at least he would search the house and make sure.",
"It was a difficult house to search.",
"He knew what I meant.",
"I think it is clear what he meant.",
"It was a very beautiful night.",
"And a beautiful home!",
"Yes, the boy would have a beautiful home.",
"The features of the old man he could not remember.",
"Neither of the men heard it.",
"But the thought of what would happen if he should keep his knowledge to himself came back again into his mind.",
"But whom would it wrong?",
"There had not been much travel on this road during the last year.",
"That, he thought, would have been beautiful, very beautiful indeed.",
"He found it hard to make himself believe that he was still in the mine, alone.",
"It was cold and black.",
"I was sorry for him, as he had otherwise a good character.",
"He could neither read nor write.",
"Would learn the old hands.",
"I wish it well.",
"I believe it has only one street.",
"To her the face was something more than beautiful.",
"He raised his face and looked at her.",
"They can be married in a month.",
"Some need less, but few require more.",
"What are some of the physical results observed?",
"I wish I could.",
"Thus came the knowledge to us in those early days.",
"But there was no other friend to whom she told it.",
"Again the sign.",
"He looked again at the letter.",
"That which he really is no one knows save himself.",
"How beautiful!",
"And thus throughout.",
"I think I never saw her but twice.",
"Has it a meaning, after all?",
"Could a person, in case of need, return by land?",
"The letter told nothing more.",
"It was almost night and very cold.",
"Often, too, she would have no fire on a cold night.",
"A few years ago a friend of mine told me of something that happened to him when he was a.",
"There are points beyond which neither will go.",
"For in the land he came from that is what he never had.",
"His view in this letter.",
"Well do I know mine own sex.",
"Quality too I create.",
"She is of baby age.",
"He had like to have got a letter.",
"She had never been in the hands of this man, but for them.",
"I wish this were done.",
"I called it so upon knowledge.",
"I send this letter away directly.",
"This is a long letter.",
"So would explain my sense and meaning at one time.",
"May I be allowed to read his letter?",
"The first letter!",
"I should wish for her but for one month, I think.",
"And I looked with meaning.",
"But I see, I see, she does not hate me!",
"Happy I never expect to be.",
"It is not come to that neither.",
"But how he did hate!",
"They held out their hands.",
"There was no need to explain things to her, for she had heard everything.",
"She turned quickly.",
"Whether it was land or money no one can tell.",
"This letter!",
"Neither could I.",
"She felt quite cold.",
"But she did not know to whom she must give first.",
"I wish to help them.",
"Every night throughout the whole summer the same thing happened.",
"Baby showed very little interest in the next room she took them to.",
"I wish I might take that.",
"The next place they went into was the most wonderful of all.",
"No more of this, I hate it to the death.",
"Not without search.",
"What would he sell?",
"What, stand they still on terms?",
"Not of the land, but of a public life.",
"What can I wish more?",
"Stand there a while, and wait.",
"Come away quickly.",
"Under whom?",
"Win her, and wear her, man, with all my heart!",
"No, mine.",
"But I must stand close yet, and see the rest.",
"They are no friends of mine, nor come they here.",
"I have this chance to win him.",
"It meant so much to me.",
"But perhaps his love has turned to hate.",
"Then she asked if he were married.",
"He raised his head at our approach.",
"Then he left me in their hands.",
"Come quickly!",
"I was quickly determined.",
"It had all happened so quickly!",
"Look on the table, and take it all.",
"To my knowledge there is no such office at court.",
"I hate them.",
"But do not show him this letter.",
"I do not wish to hear it.",
"And as with the men, so, and no otherwise, was it with the women.",
"Let him keep the land who can, by the right of the most strong.",
"She took mine, they tell me.",
"All right in lots of ways, too.",
"He was ready for action.",
"He was ready.",
"He raised his head and looked across the room.",
"They can stand it.",
"His hands were on the table top, and had been from the beginning.",
"Neither of them saw it go.",
"Such a fish!",
"To a very beautiful place, she said.",
"But what was the beautiful place like, and where was it?",
"He was still too far down south.",
"And when they looked she was neither of them, and yet all of them at once.",
"Before me I saw him whom I had expected to see.",
"He is a wonderful man.",
"Not much, I expect.",
"I meant to take him or to kill him.",
"What he was I could not guess, but I was dead set on finding out before the night was over.",
"He did not wish to be seen again himself just at present.",
"He suggested that for a married man I was much too free in my ways.",
"Who is responsible?",
"They are in his department.",
"Neither do I.",
"And what did he expect to learn from it when he found it?",
"But we have no actual knowledge.",
"I wish he would go away.",
"How I wish he could have known!",
"What a wonderful episode it had been!",
"What was the meaning of that?",
"The reason of this is not difficult to explain.",
"But it is a beautiful church for all that.",
"Picture of a modern table.",
"Who require most food.",
"Cold water to the eyes.",
"After it is once cold, very few will eat it.",
"And if they do require any thing, it is only simple water.",
"But people generally think otherwise.",
"But I have not so learned human nature.",
"If they came home very cold, they were not allowed to approach the fire too soon.",
"Education of both hands.",
"Expect the second on the next night at the same hour.",
"I am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer.",
"I have not come to sell, but to buy.",
"He died out there in the cold.",
"Look at the way they stand up.",
"Many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him.",
"And the first question ever asked of a man is in reference to his income, rather than his character.",
"Human nature does not change very much.",
"Otherwise no rule would be needed.",
"I must add one word more.",
"Neither need I!",
"I took her hands, and looked her full in the face.",
"I can now move my feet.",
"How it happened that this letter did not go I cannot imagine.",
"A word will explain enough.",
"He is a married man, but has no family.",
"When I had done, I went back to mine.",
"Nature wants him still, it is likely.",
"Of whom, then?",
"I wish now that I had done so.",
"I did not understand what he meant by the term, and said so.",
"Write quickly and tell me.",
"It was such a beautiful place!",
"I wish I could stay here always.",
"He is mine no more!",
"In music it was otherwise.",
"My father wanted us to go on and try to get other sounds, but we were so interested in what we had done we wanted to try it out.",
"Many other similar tests were made and the effect was always noted.",
"But even more wonderful things were to come.",
"The story of its wonderful development is a story of our own country.",
"And how, to men, could they be otherwise?",
"If so, I wish to state my position.",
"But they were ready.",
"He was now on his second year in his present charge.",
"In this last named charge, he is at this writing doing effective work.",
"None of the older children had looked at the baby.",
"They do not know what to charge, and therefore charge nothing.",
"What to wear is something of a problem.",
"It is not bad, neither is it good.",
"It is difficult to think otherwise.",
"The people have the right to expect that in their interest he will take good care of himself.",
"That road is neither interesting nor good.",
"Any little business of the house interested him.",
"I hate her!",
"Every separate piece has its history.",
"He was neither.",
"No one could explain why this was so.",
"What he meant, however, she could not even guess.",
"Should she see him in the street?",
"She must stand to her own words.",
"I must save her!",
"Yet she should like to know who had taken his letter.",
"He was not himself when he wrote that letter.",
"This letter is private.",
"In his hand he carried a white staff of office.",
"She alone is responsible.",
"Good land!",
"But good land!",
"I wish our country would do as well.",
"Under the table!",
"In good hands?",
"They were very beautiful to look upon.",
"She raised her head, and, looking at him, told him she was ready.",
"Others, whom I asked, had heard nothing of this.",
"Neither party has been quite consistent.",
"We said that they too were very beautiful.",
"The approach to the church is beautiful, and the church itself full of interest.",
"Stand, who comes here?",
"The air is very beautiful.",
"No, I have no knowledge of what it was.",
"He raised his head and looked me full in the face.",
"All this had to be learned by heart.",
"This, then, was the meaning of the world as nearly as it could be said to have a single meaning.",
"I wish I had seen more of her.",
"She is wonderful.",
"Did she not once save his life?",
"She would not let that stand in her way, I am sure.",
"It is all theory in my head.",
"We are going to do the thing with our own hands.",
"We could stay on land if we wanted to do those things.",
"Explain it?",
"She had been so long in the building that she was beginning to break down and wear out.",
"They were all out of town for the weekend.",
"The little old man was still in charge, and he said no.",
"But I am at the end of my resources.",
"We had learned.",
"The land was all right.",
"I soon learned a bit.",
"And he will win out.",
"And this happened not once, nor twice, but time after time.",
"Everything had to be carried up on his back.",
"But it is only a theory of mine, this living on air.",
"But our table!",
"There was no sign of them.",
"It is lots of fun.",
"In fact, there had been no fish to drive.",
"Since it did not matter which one of the family was killed, they selected this old man who lived by himself.",
"I wish I had done the same.",
"I have become all things to all men, so that I might by all means save some.",
"She has done a beautiful thing to me.",
"For she has done a beautiful thing to me.",
"For I do not do what I want to do, but I do what I hate.",
"And how can they believe in him of whom they have not heard?",
"Then a wonderful thing happened.",
"Not even mine.",
"He was a cold man.",
"He never raised hand to me.",
"All women married.",
"Political power and the land always go together.",
"For know, that she had never decided between us, and it was because of him that she was not already and long since mine.",
"The place was wonderful.",
"Explain me that.",
"I learned much from both.",
"She was not beautiful.",
"I meant to do it.",
"I give up mine to pay for it.",
"I have done the crime.",
"For how can it be otherwise?",
"My feet are so cold.",
"There is none on the table?",
"They seem to think that it is not necessary that a general should have the least knowledge of the art of war.",
"The many men, so beautiful!",
"I have many friends, but I have always needed a human being to whom I was everything.",
"She could have expected no love but mine.",
"Her death makes me hate them.",
"In short, they have a great deal of nature.",
"It is true, they were almost always married to some one else.",
"May senior did not return.",
"Now I am thinking of getting married.",
"It could not be otherwise.",
"This life is sort of less responsible than that other.",
"Let them see as much of life as they can stand.",
"I do not feel well, and I wish to get home.",
"I get up to add one thing more.",
"Go south!",
"I have been reading such lots of law, and it seems to take away the power of writing from me.",
"It should sell the thing.",
"Nor why I have written a real letter.",
"That, at least, was how I meant it.",
"Even my knowledge of him leads me thus far.",
"Stand by!",
"Is not this wonderful?",
"By my way of thinking, neither of us need be wrong.",
"I had such an interesting letter from him.",
"I still keep wonderful.",
"Never having found a chance to send this off, I may add more of my news.",
"I have no book of reference to put me right.",
"As for my health, I got over my cold in a fine style, but have not been very well of late.",
"But these things are too much to expect.",
"I wish I was.",
"He was beautiful as the day, but his day is done!",
"It was the only sign of character he ever showed.",
"To sell.",
"A fish.",
"A table.",
"My, mine.",
"Married, husband.",
"Another country, foreign land.",
"I have a great cold.",
"He had been married, but his wife had long been dead.",
"When we saw this woman with the baby, we thought that it was her child.",
"What was its nature?",
"I have learned very little that is new.",
"I wish to do good to others.",
"It was not necessary for her to add this, however.",
"We read these words, and it seems to us that this has no reference to us.",
"One should either be a work of art, or wear a work of art.",
"The men may be said to wear nothing.",
"The country was really very beautiful.",
"I saw this done twice."],

"Next morning we reached home.",
"It will be useful.",
"He was sorry, but it could not be helped.",
"Sit down.",
"As it would be our tax, it could not be a very minute tax, although it is only the second tax which we have suggested.",
"If so, all the worse for society.",
"Is war the only alternative?",
"They have been growing worse and worse.",
"I fear!",
"I did not do so yesterday because I had not an opportunity.",
"And now they gave details.",
"Perhaps society is more often taken in the other way.",
"But it was very much worse than that.",
"How he looked forward to it!",
"She made a step forward.",
"He was worse.",
"The more he saw of her the worse he would be.",
"He loved her.",
"She loved the little black children.",
"How they loved that!",
"They loved him very much.",
"She loved the people there, but she knew if she wanted to get well she would have to go home.",
"The people say I do not follow the old ways.",
"It is bad to follow new ways.",
"In great fear they came.",
"The look of fear was gone from their eyes.",
"She showed them the things she had and how useful they were.",
"This means bad trouble.",
"Day by day he became worse.",
"I have tested it.",
"The worse the people are, the more they need help.",
"They are treated worse than animals.",
"Not one dog, but many, come running out.",
"But he knew that trouble was at hand.",
"At first this practice seemed to bring him trouble.",
"The game was continued.",
"That might result in playing all of the games in one city.",
"Some of them were not exactly new to the job but were in new jobs.",
"So at last the opportunity had come.",
"Then took a step forward.",
"We met with equal success all over the country.",
"I add another thing which had its influence, I am sure.",
"Be of heart, and fear nothing.",
"When they charge by the column.",
"How wonderful that career has been, does not the world know?",
"We reached the scene of war.",
"How could it be if they loved him?",
"He started forward.",
"The trouble is, we, want to do the talking.",
"Even the dog was still.",
"It was all over in a minute.",
"Still, as they went forward, they looked back.",

"So much the worse?",
"Come, sit down by me.",
"I never loved anyone else.",
"Well, it was because it helped him a little.",
"It has been said that her children only learn to write, not to read, but it is to be supposed that they can read what they write, and therefore can read other material.",
"The other differences would be in degree only.",
"It is therefore difficult to understand that he did not see it as an island.",

"But people were worse.",
"Sit down and say no more.",
"I thought hard for a minute.",
"But let it pass.",

"How, having tested it, could she look forward to a life like that?",
"Here was her opportunity.",
"There is no possibility of any such thing as that.",
"And after the old man went up and married mother, it was worse.",
"Together they helped him up.",
"They sit on the ground.",
"He would sit up a great part of the night sometimes to read one of these books.",
"He helped them to get work, and did them good in many other ways.",
"It brought trouble to many people.",
"Her face showed that she was in trouble.",
"This trouble brought on a war.",
"It would take a great deal of work and trouble.",
"He put it into her hands for a minute.",
"She made a little song about it.",
"She became famous.",
"Serve this up hot.",
"Serve it up hot.",
"So serve it up.",
"There was the trouble.",
"All the same, there was no use in meeting trouble.",
"The trouble was, he might not get much support.",
"The old man held his hand a minute, then turned to the road.",
"Another came forward.",
"Is not this the true solution of the great problem?",
"No others have so loved one another.",
"Who were they who so loved as no others had loved?",
"Why will not some one take the trouble to learn what we have?",
"But she had other things in store for him.",
"The dog did not appear again.",
"In not a single instance did I hear of a man being turned off to make a place for a woman.",
"I have seen him box often.",
"But they need have had no fear.",
"Follow me!",
"There is more chance of success now.",
"No, wait a minute!",
"He made as if to step forward.",
"He saw that, and made the opportunity, and made love to me.",
"I have all but reached the end.",
"I had no opportunity for more.",
"This gave him the opportunity he wanted.",
"Fear for him or fear for themselves?",
"It could not be helped.",
"Give me details.",
"I must be the one to stay home now, and look after things, and learn to be useful.",
"But not so much as if he had loved me more.",
"At least, I fear so.",
"Never had I loved her as I did at that moment.",
"She would have loved him.",
"He was a dog.",
"He had never before known a dog that he could not make love him.",
"I take up now my song.",
"The dog took it and went away.",
"One of them got married, and the other continued his trade.",
"Back to active life among men!",
"The other man helped him clear the table.",
"They found not a man, but a dog.",
"He would never leave his son a minute.",
"Is there not cause for fear, on the other hand, that the method he suggests will have that very result?",
"No opportunity was given for discussion, nor was there any.",
"Now, in fact, they would not serve for anything else.",
"Also just now it happens to be mine.",
"The end was, that without nearly spending his little store, he had, before the time came for his return to the college, built another room.",
"What is there that I fear to say?",
"They would not trouble about it.",
"There is a good deal of that variety in the present war.",
"Details will come.",
"The trouble is that I know so little about it.",
"Did he fear me?",
"Until that moment I had never really loved.",
"I was as far off the solution of the problem as ever.",
"Her only thought was of the man she loved.",
"Death is the least we have to fear.",
"What are the elements of success in politics?",
"Were we prepared for that?",
"But at last he had to pass us and go on.",
"It was an important and useful success.",
"It was outside his official work and I give him all credit and respect for the help he gave us.",
"But we did not remain there long.",
"But in any case we did not remain there long.",
"And so the days pass, one very like another.",
"To fear nothing, say nothing.",
"I fear she had but little choice.",
"Take myself, for instance.",
"It seemed to me I saw another opportunity.",
"I thought that the look he gave was almost one of respect, but it was hard to tell.",
"I fear he will find he is wrong.",
"So she loved him.",
"In a minute we should see.",
"He was a different man when he continued.",
"They will never have the opportunity.",
"But that cannot be helped.",
"He liked variety, he said.",
"But it cannot be helped.",
"The knowledge should be useful, to say the least.",
"A minute would say.",
"I have not got my degree.",
"The solution was well worth the effort it cost.",
"No great state can remain at rest long together.",
"He was now strong enough to take his place as the leader of the popular party.",
"The education, however, which he received had a great influence upon him.",
"The will was immediately made public.",
"Such a leader was at hand.",
"At last, when he found that not even thus could he make many come forward, he put some of them to death.",
"And if the man will do that, there is little fear but that the woman will do it also.",
"For him himself I have no fear.",
"But only, I fear, for a time.",
"Why take so much trouble?",
"I asked him if he knew the plant.",
"Which of these ways was I to follow?",
"They remain.",
"It is now a store room.",
"So much for the western front.",
"But he seemed to avoid her as much as he did the others.",
"I expect him here any minute.",
"He has been very good, but I fear for his mind.",
"I had no idea it was so forward.",
"I look forward to the worse half being past, and keep up as well as I can.",
"The old man had had a great deal of trouble with his family.",
"And how could it be moving toward him?",
"She will remain in that form until such time as she has a change of heart.",
"Wait a minute.",
"After all, they all loved to hear stories.",
"Then she turned and continued on her way.",
"Thus the real trouble was kept from the public until new plans could be determined upon.",
"This was the last of the active operations.",
"But she knew that her time for active service was over.",
"Here it is that her great influence is still felt.",
"The result of this testing process showed itself in various ways.",
"She was once again among friends, and had the society of her daughter.",
"Has a dog money?",
"But through the thought he loved the woman.",
"None of the details really interested him.",
"I am not very sure that it will be a success.",
"For a man needs to be loved as much as a woman needs it.",
"She has no fear.",
"They are worse than children.",
"It comes to pass.",
"Yes, I have details.",
"He was not a society man.",
"It was too cold to stand still even for a minute.",
"But he did not sit down.",
"It is that particular point which gives me trouble at the present moment.",
"They both loved the same man.",
"It is worse than that.",
"In some part her thought reached him.",
"His own life had been no great success.",
"I helped him.",
"But the first weeks in the store showed him that he knew only a few.",
"She was living in town and working in some store or other he knew, but that was all.",
"Then he looked across the store.",
"He made no answer for a minute.",
"This always happens when it is above their own, and very usually when it is below.",
"Season and serve.",
"Serve quickly.",
"Send it to table immediately.",
"If they are not a fine green, change the water again, cover them as before, and make them hot.",
"To man they are immediately useful in various ways.",
"If kept in a cool place, it will remain good some days.",
"It will remain good for many months.",
"When much is taken, these come on immediately.",
"One thing helped me much.",
"Of course, it had, and has, a certain success.",
"Come sit down a moment with me.",
"Might not his mother ask him further details about his walk?",
"Who knows how her stay in the hospital might have turned out?",
"I loved her very much and we meant a great deal to each other.",
"Just think what is to follow.",
"But the child was to have no opportunity for that day.",
"How could he know that song?",
"And I added that there was no help when the trouble came.",
"They are prepared now to do so.",
"But still we tell the story which once we loved to tell.",
"But success did not stop here.",
"Although a man of character might write one article in a work of this nature, it does not follow that a man of no character does not write the next.",
"I could pass on neither side, and the end was near.",
"I was on an island of some kind.",
"No need to mention any names.",
"The war continued.",
"Here is another instance.",
"So is life in many parts of this island.",
"The power of the newspapers is that most people read them, and that many people read nothing else.",
"There is no need for fear.",
"Our names may be heard in song.",
"Give us the song of other years.",
"Here I must sit alone!",
"In what instance?",
"But I will leave these to one side and bring forward the rest.",
"Evidence of their feeling is found in the fact that numbers daily come over to our side.",
"Such was the status of things in that respect.",
"The world is bad and will become worse and worse.",
"Only one solution presented itself to his mind.",
"They might be greater in degree.",
"I was not quite prepared for the result.",
"But to what I could call love they had never looked forward.",
"I do not fear.",
"Alternative, war.",
"Then came the most difficult part of the operations.",
"He asked nothing but to serve.",
"To serve her, his country, his future!",
"She loved him.",
"He had no fear and he knew his car.",
"Fine society to fall into!",
"The past active and important hours had left little room for thought of her.",
"She knew he had come with news or trouble or need of help.",
"She had to keep her hands active that day, so in some measure to control her mind.",
"Never had she loved him quite so well as then.",
"I am like a dog.",
"What did that day hold in store for her?",
"They reached the house and went in.",
"She was prepared.",
"It seemed to her that she loved him all the more, every moment, even though he made it so hard for her.",
"My cold came back, got worse and worse.",
"His opportunity had now come.",
"It would pass over him.",
"They loved a fight.",
"They might hate it, too, but they loved it most.",
"They fight even at their games.",
"They say if she gets over this, there is no worse place for her to meet.",
"The note had reached him too late, and he said we must go on the outside.",
"Put these forward, under cover.",
"There was no one else to fear.",
"No worse than many another.",
"The more I tried the worse it got.",
"It came at length, however, and I immediately went on board.",
"And in very much the same way her day continued.",
"Sit down over there, across the room.",
"And he loved her.",
"He loved her, did he?",
"Twice then she had been sure that she loved him.",
"Where he went now she must follow!",
"But there was no room for fear.",
"She thought that he was going to pass without seeing her.",
"Which of these therefore is by nature prior?",
"The one therefore is in every respect prior to being.",
"Or is it in a certain respect these, and in a certain respect not?",
"Come we will go look at that store house now.",
"But the dog would not mind.",
"She could put up with almost anything in her friends, but success!",
"This would give him an opportunity.",
"I only knew I loved him.",
"Every woman is a student of political economy.",
"We remain here one week, then we go to the island.",
"Try and not make any trouble.",
"The work is all done by hand, which is one reason that they are so expensive.",
"I am an old dog now, and am writing, or rather getting a friend to write, the story of my life.",
"She loved her husband and children, and did everything she could to make them happy.",
"I have never had any trouble with her.",
"Then he got to be a very good dog.",
"Poor old dog.",
"Then she began to tell him about the dog fight.",
"I thought it was a great deal of trouble to take care of them.",
"This made me worse than ever.",
"She was worse than I was.",
"Perhaps when we get our dog he will.",
"The man put out his hand and helped her.",
"He was put in a box car.",
"They were always good to him, and he said he loved all animals while he liked very few people.",
"Too much trouble.",
"After all, he was not such a bad dog.",
"Neither one nor another was leader.",
"He loved our little daughter very much.",
"But we wrote to each other all the time, and she loved me.",
"That was the trouble, sure enough.",
"Pass it by!",
"Each is built for a particular career.",
"Research here has its opportunity.",
"Will immediately did as he was told.",
"It happens that ways sometimes.",
"One thing helped him.",
"With that he started operations.",
"They started a search immediately.",
"Well, well, sit down again.",
"What is the alternative to that?",
"Every dog has its day.",
"There is therefore much room left for critical comparison and selection.",
"That was the beginning of all the trouble.",
"I guess I never felt worse than I did then.",
"True, I fear no man.",
"Do not mention him.",
"The investigation was being carried on daily.",
"Yes, somebody had helped her.",
"And how could she ever pass the next house?",
"It has notes of my daily reading.",
"Well, that gave me something to reason about, and something new to look forward to.",
"But I do not stop, I pass the small things by.",
"I am worse than I was last night.",
"He is famous in this city!",
"But had it helped her?",
"He is in great trouble.",
"Was it her trouble?",
"They were older, and they loved each other, and left him to me.",
"Would not her life be a success, then?",
"But we have got to pay him for his trouble.",
"It is such a song as we should expect from him.",
"The old man continued his work.",
"But it pretty often happens that way!",
"They set a certain value upon him for his use in this respect.",
"I thought my last minute had come.",
"Then he continued.",
"What love can pass that?",
"My trouble is, I want somebody else to take care of.",
"But that was not necessary, I had already made up my mind, I left almost immediately.",
"He was prepared, he lost no time.",
"Fear not!",
"The dog alone?",
"He did not pass by as the other animals had done.",
"And it always happens when we are going out!",
"I should not have gone out if I had felt the least fear for her.",
"He could no longer remember exactly how they had reached him.",
"But recent years have seen, in this respect, a great change.",
"The dead fear not the force of men.",
"I will leave word with his dog.",
"Then the worse for me.",
"Forward, man.",
"I fear I am too near.",
"Out, dog, dog.",
"But this did not trouble him so much as it might have done.",
"There was no alternative.",
"Please sit down a moment.",
"I saw him over on the island.",
"They were all as far forward as they could get.",
"Yet how many people save those in the business, or who have bought cars, know this interesting fact?",
"This could not be helped.",
"The next person to come there will take the letter with him and see to its delivery.",
"What will follow its success?",
"We are in the presence of a new organization of society.",
"It will pass.",
"They pass through that way.",
"He came forward into the light now.",
"Sit down, my child.",
"Later he came for the material which we kept ready for him.",
"The books were quite expensive but well worth the cost.",
"Continued writing my report.",
"None are considered useful.",
"Here is an instance.",
"We continued going through street after street.",
"They are little green things.",
"What I have seen, and what I have felt, gives me reason to fear every thing.",
"Sit down!",
"The woman seemed to view me with an increased respect from that very moment.",
"Let that problem rest until the time comes for solution.",
"We will sit about the fire and tell stories.",
"And such cases as these would all pass through my hands.",
"A few minutes later and all was prepared.",
"I know it too well not to hate and fear it.",
"She must be led, not leader.",
"They found that they were worse off than before.",
"And it will remain.",
"And it was a great opportunity, indeed!",
"The morning meeting continued to be held at.",
"I am not a water dog.",
"The island was reached.",
"The others had no alternative.",
"Now for the first time he felt that there was something worse.",
"He had come and gone, and she knew what fear was!",
"They were moving!",
"It was time, indeed, that he helped himself.",
"There is the possibility of other money.",
"All the time I loved beautiful things, and beautiful women, and the thought of them.",
"I never loved her.",
"The play was a great success.",
"Quite a social success, according to the papers!",
"I loved it.",
"Her whole body seemed to be moving to the music.",
"Sit down, please.",
"And so it came to pass.",
"Next morning, early, we had a meeting in the store.",
"Later, he gave us some interesting details.",
"I married a poor man because I loved him.",
"The rest of the story was in the newspapers next day, although there was no mention of our names.",
"Nothing ever happens here.",
"He must have had a career of some sort in this country.",
"We follow the road a little.",
"It was not the first time that I had helped him and been well paid for my help.",
"For song is the speech of feeling.",
"Love as he loved!",
"I do not fear death.",
"Finally came the day of his release.",
"The society of his son he no longer seemed to enjoy.",
"It was about this time that I began to write in newspapers.",
"She looked down at the dog.",
"He loved her!",
"And yet they met daily.",
"Should she never see him again, never again hear him tell her that he loved her, would always love her?",
"I have made man after mine image.",
"I will yet go forward.",
"I thought that it might be useful at a moment like this.",
"The example is great, the opportunity is still greater.",
"We decided to remain.",
"These details complete those which I have already given.",
"I had had an opportunity of being useful to him.",
"This man, they said, loved that woman.",
"I continued to go on.",
"Should we follow it, or should we stop?",
"He did not avoid the light.",
"They had just reached it when they heard themselves called by name.",
"I can now mention his name.",
"No possible chance of success.",
"That sometimes happens.",
"Is he a dog?",
"But it will be asked, by what method is this cause to be detected?",
"Why should we fear death?",
"His personal character is seen on the face of his public career.",
"He had reached the end of things.",
"I thought she loved me and knew me.",
"She did not know me any more than she loved me.",
"Well, now come in the dog and the man.",
"There is no need for going into details of the story, how I learned, or when.",
"I thought of the dog.",
"There was talking in that box.",
"It is not fear.",
"How I hate men and fear them!",
"Will they remain so?",
"Just think what would follow!",
"He could not help her, and prepared to return again to a season at his mine.",
"He helped the baby to get on board.",
"It was a great success.",
"I was a leader.",
"So completely was she under his influence that she did so.",
"There was one additional fact at this part of the view which I must mention.",
"He was prepared for a long run.",
"He seems to have been loved by everybody.",
"I will give an instance of what I mean.",
"Thus presented, the case looked serious.",
"The little home could serve us no longer.",
"He also took out a small box.",
"His face had no trouble in it now.",
"He is usually a very good dog.",
"It must be very useful.",
"Need we fear this?",
"Sometimes I would sit down, sometimes I would stand up, sometimes I would walk about.",
"The music continued.",
"Something worse than anything that had gone before!",
"He reached the book section.",
"He was being tested.",
"It increased their respect for her.",
"That helped to explain her.",
"He took one step forward.",
"But he held her entire respect.",
"All that night the house was a hospital.",
"She would not mention the subject again probably.",
"Thinking of her as a white girl, he looked at her with respect.",
"Within half an hour land was reached.",
"In some ways he was less trouble than if he had been able to see.",
"Or forward?",
"I was going to have him all to myself, the only person in the world I ever loved.",
"I loved to hear him call me by it.",
"He never loved her.",
"Then indeed all hope for me with the girl I loved would be over.",
"There must be a solution.",
"That happens with women sometimes.",
"But I would fear for myself.",
"At all events he should know that I was for him, not against him, in this time of trouble.",
"Success is in the blood.",
"Respect all men and try to find the good in all.",
"I place these elements according to their value.",
"And often the trouble is he has given her too much for nothing.",
"He knows where his men are every minute of the day or night.",
"I kept getting smaller and smaller.",
"But there simply is no alternative.",
"Sometimes that happens to me when I get too worked up.",
"And I loved every single minute of it!",
"He loved his players and his players loved him.",
"This was perhaps in some degree necessary, and it was natural in the state of his mind.",
"They knew that this must eventually drive me out of the country.",
"There was no other means of access to the box.",
"I must sit as he did and look on.",
"And I take trouble to save myself.",
"He will be in here in a minute!",
"But what success had they?",
"His eyes continued to meet her own.",
"It was really a small drug store.",
"I was in great fear and thought my end had come.",
"How can one get to the island?",
"Then he asked if there was any defense.",
"But I will not stay up a minute longer.",
"For quite a month, it had an influence on the whole party.",
"Has he no claims?",
"All this is matter of daily experience with us.",
"The officials of the island led an easy life, therefore.",
"But his eyes could follow her.",
"It might have been an hour, or a minute, or a day.",
"There was at least something like society in that, and something to do.",
"He will see the box and remember it.",
"Seems but little the worse for wear.",
"The author knew children and loved them, and wrote to them and not for them.",
"She claims that no human reason has been equal to the question.",
"While it has done this, it may, on the other hand, have brought a benefit.",
"Still, it gives them some time to be prepared.",
"They were now in the cool green light of the living room.",
"They were moving.",
"The dog must have heard something.",
"We need not follow the history.",
"He seemed to do everything save mention names.",
"He loved her all the more for the knowledge that he had not loved her enough.",
"And I have never had quite the right opportunity of finding out.",
"It seems to me that all my life I have lived in fear.",
"What was her own trouble compared to this?",
"She put the box behind her.",
"The school helped.",
"Probably he will be much worse.",
"A sorry defense!",
"Indeed, no defense at all.",
"There had been no defense.",
"He, in his turn, began to produce papers.",
"She showed me this box.",
"They were not in that box when she came here.",
"Follow him!",
"Good, useful work.",
"A great deal got into the newspapers.",
"That gave me my opportunity.",
"At all events, for some reason, this one showed no fear.",
"Look at the size of the box.",
"It seemed to be moving well.",
"I must be prepared.",
"In another minute it would have been too late.",
"Why, then, should he fear?",
"In a minute he had reached them.",
"But, let that pass.",
"Then a new fear came to him.",
"It all took place in a minute.",
"The very thought of such a possibility decided the question for him.",
"It would not do to sit there all night.",
"Then fear came back to him.",
"But the money got him into trouble.",
"He got it worse nor I did.",
"He had still to pass through it.",
"Our great fear is from want of power in government.",
"I observed he might serve a campaign.",
"There is no church upon the island.",
"That does not make his book the worse.",
"If it is just, they will follow it, be his practice what it will.",
"The addition of another story would make an useful house, but it cannot be great.",
"It is a love song.",
"No more games.",
"All parts of the body, however, do not have this sense in an equal degree.",
"The main thing is to lower the temperature.",
"It is from his statement that this history is taken.",
"Nature had made him good, but society could make him very bad.",
"We received him as a child into our fold, and we are responsible for his development.",
"I had not thought him great, nor a leader of men.",
"But not alone in books does one meet his own image at every turn.",
"What had I to fear or care?",
"It is very well to be prepared when company is expected, but friends may come at any time.",
"The people are like a great family moving into a new house.",
"They save a deal of trouble.",
"It did not leave her until she reached her own house.",
"They could not be worse than they are.",
"He once loved me.",
"She may fear.",
"I found her ready prepared to go out.",
"But I know I designed to mention that they were.",
"Not that I stand in fear of my daughter neither.",
"I will not fear death, or any thing else.",
"Success indeed!",
"But how he loved them!",
"She loved them.",
"So the children did not wait a minute more.",
"It was one of his favorite games.",
"He thought a minute.",
"As soon as she was done, he wanted to go right away that minute.",
"Then came a rest period before they went forward again.",
"The boy and the little lost girl had reached a turn in the road.",
"I was made for society.",
"I am not so green as I was.",
"Fear not.",
"Sit down, old father, sit, and call me daughter.",
"I hate him worse for that than all the rest.",
"Store, store.",
"In what degree?",
"I fear him?",
"He has been useful to me, and may be again.",
"She had heard my song!",
"She began to fear.",
"Things went from bad to worse.",
"The same thing often happens to me.",
"At home, things got worse.",
"Have to be moving along if he wanted to get there some time that day.",
"They always follow.",
"He made no move to follow.",
"He reached it rather late.",
"There was cold fear.",
"But there was no fear in his heart.",
"Might be expensive.",
"Save trouble!",
"Save trouble, indeed.",
"And yet he loved her more than ever.",
"But if the dog said so, it must be true.",
"And the poor little dog?",
"But I am not going to trouble myself to make things, my little dear.",
"And that was the only song which they knew.",
"He will give no more trouble.",
"My funds are running low.",
"Years before it had been thought out and prepared.",
"But it happened that I had an alternative.",
"I am testing an idea, that is all.",
"No, it was the only possible course to give him leave and follow him up close.",
"I have tested what he told me in every way that I could, and the test has held.",
"She, I am very sure, will never trouble to read this book.",
"Then did he remain in it dead?",
"It was the author!",
"The work has to be done immediately.",
"He is the party immediately interested.",
"It would not be the first instance of the kind.",
"That no such evidence has been brought forward.",
"But I think he may make a statement.",
"There was no real opportunity.",
"The people loved to see their great men brought down to their own level.",
"But this great department has already been presented.",
"Temperature of the water.",
"How prepared.",
"It was done in a minute.",
"This dog also followed me.",
"So with all games.",
"We only wish we had the opportunity now.",
"Every nation must create its own song.",
"In this work he met with no little success.",
"In process of time, however, a strong society was established.",
"The opportunity was too good to be lost.",
"The whole city was a hospital.",
"But out of one trouble, we were soon into another.",
"A little later the games began.",
"They pass, and are gone.",
"We have been a famous family in our time.",
"Until he had done so in his own way, and at his own time, he would continue to sit where he was.",
"Have no fear of that.",
"From the first moment I saw him I loved him.",
"Fear him!",
"They fear her.",
"The fire had but just reached the door when he came.",
"Yes, she loved him.",
"It must take place immediately.",
"And this evil daily increased.",
"Or there would be nice games for them to play at.",
"But, of course, when I was helped I called out.",
"What, again, do the smaller of them live upon?",
"The song has always been popular.",
"He continued to look at her.",
"He was to live to believe this, I say, though he was not to live, I may not less definitely mention, to do much else.",
"As I did so I saw a man moving across the room directly toward me!",
"The figure more and more clearly defined itself.",
"Take the watch for instance.",
"She loved the child in her own way, but she also wanted to go for many other reasons.",
"We will sit here a little longer.",
"I have never loved any girl before.",
"The opportunity, however, very soon came.",
"It is success.",
"And the time continued to go by.",
"Immediately he set to work.",
"But he makes no mention of his college.",
"He will come when he has opportunity.",
"Avoid such people.",
"And great fear came upon all who heard of it.",
"He loved but the once.",
"Few of his type remain.",
"That was the trouble.",
"He loved his father.",
"He would have liked to avoid it.",
"If we do this we need not fear.",
"She could not avoid him, and he came up to her.",
"However, on the whole, I was very happy in his society, and there was more than a chance that I should become his wife.",
"Without it we pass over so much.",
"The trouble is that over here we have all been brought up together.",
"They have a dog, too!",
"Poor dog!",
"Now I, for one, do not fear a woman.",
"Then we saw what the trouble was.",
"Follow, follow, follow me.",
"The letter to myself has not yet reached me.",
"I hope they may produce some of the ready.",
"In this case, however, it was not the dog that died.",
"I have done with big prices from now out.",
"I wonder, and fear not.",
"These seem all elements of success.",
"I fear not at all.",
"Look, image.",
"A song.",
"It will be long, yet, before that comes to pass.",
"Something was being presented to the public there.",
"If I want to help the poor, that is, to make the poor no longer poor, I must not produce poor people.",
"But it is clear and simple when the requirements are simple.",
"Something was moving about in one place.",
"I cannot say as much for the present hospital, which I went over."],

["It was become dark.",
"Why, says he, I want to know why, his own sister?",
"On we went, my sister leading.",
"And so a few minutes passed.",
"It appeared to come from the floor below.",
"Leaving the room, I made my way down to the study.",
"It was as firm as a rock.",
"And so the day passed.",
"It was far too dark for my eyes to be of much use.",
"I still held my gun.",
"And so another great while passed.",
"It appeared just as I had first seen it.",
"Last night, I was sitting here in my study, writing.",
"After dinner, I went to see him, again.",
"It is still dark.",
"Some of his friends came in after dinner and the talk was most interesting.",
"However, this one seems to have been successful.",
"The days passed quickly enough until we started.",
"What is environment?",
"The next rule is commercial.",
"Who sets price?",
"He then asked whether she knew where a letter would reach her at present.",
"Next night I passed as well.",
"She could not have passed it.",
"She had but one story to tell, and seemed the least able of all the party to suggest any way of accounting for what had happened.",
"Nobody had an answer.",
"Everything in perfect order.",
"Put him to sleep.",
"We came to an agreement.",
"Everything was perfect.",
"Nobody said anything for some time.",
"I did not sleep at all.",
"It caught.",
"To sleep there was out of the question.",
"Nobody seemed to know of them.",
"My wife was with me, and she, being according to law nobody, of course I was alone.",
"And yet he had never found any other person who agreed with him in it.",
"How has each one passed the day?",
"I was willing he should.",
"That, as was well known, was his regular business.",
"He would lose his dinner.",
"Let me sleep.",
"He would die first!",
"One year passed, then another.",
"Quite easily.",
"He looked at everything on its dark side.",
"A nice voice, too.",
"He was so easily carried away.",
"Never again after tonight.",
"He looked at her with a look of pain.",
"For a few days after what had passed there was a happy reaction in the house.",
"Be firm.",
"I know a good voice when I hear it.",
"Now begin.",
"He says he would rather die than remain with her.",
"I am willing.",
"And if her mother agreed, would her church send her out to that field?",
"Waiting is hard sometimes.",
"The months passed quickly.",
"She was willing to do this as long as she had no children.",
"We have made new laws.",
"New laws could not really change them.",
"Often she would not be able to get home at night and would have to sleep in the open.",
"At last it began to get dark.",
"They were always putting off doing the building.",
"At last they agreed to go.",
"He took them to his house and had a big dinner for them.",
"They must die!",
"Please make peace.",
"But one dark night he died.",
"She wanted to be where she could reach the most people.",
"It did not take long with many willing hands to build a church and school.",
"It could be reached so easily.",
"The chief went to a tree and got ready to cut it down.",
"In the first years she sent most of it back home to take care of her mother and sister.",
"As soon as she was strong enough, she began to go about telling about her work.",
"A fine dinner is lost within me.",
"To influence this larger public, therefore, men who could write came little by little into a larger demand.",
"I have rather a voice myself.",
"Not that he was by any means a perfect man.",
"He had, of course, to begin work at an early age.",
"When necessary he could be firm.",
"The message went home.",
"From the beginning to the end I found the same presence of mind as if I had been sitting in my own study.",
"Nobody to do for.",
"Been putting it off all these months.",
"He asked him if he felt any pain in his side?",
"How did he die?",
"For a moment his sister did not answer.",
"Why was he waiting there?",
"That ended our first interview.",
"I looked around for my gun, and found that I had left it behind.",
"A year passed.",
"Thus ended all.",
"Had she a sister?",
"What is already perfect cannot be made more perfect.",
"Nobody ever goes there now.",
"Nobody would have taken them if he had.",
"Her father caught her close.",
"By trying to be perfect in it.",
"Even his wife does not begin to understand him.",
"It was a perfect day.",
"She looked across the room at her sister who was paying her a visit.",
"He must have a long rest, with a complete change of environment.",
"So it was dark.",
"I begin to see it is so.",
"Something very telling.",
"Tonight no sound out of either.",
"For the first time he seemed to lose heart.",
"The day that followed was pretty dark to both men.",
"They had been sold.",
"It was some minutes before they caught up.",
"She had passed one of those men who had got the long start of her.",
"They passed.",
"Several of the men who had been behind caught up.",
"That was a month ago, and the great moment could not possibly be far now.",
"Or I must die.",
"I die, I die.",
"Possibly I may.",
"I die.",
"What, by dark?",
"Thus it was with the first floor of the house.",
"They certainly enjoy it, and no one is ever kept waiting.",
"Probably he knows some figures.",
"Soon I had quite a number at work and was getting my stuff down quite fast.",
"On one point, however, everybody was agreed.",
"From that time on peace was in the air.",
"He lived to become a wonderful link with the past.",
"This was interesting work, but hot and fast.",
"Thus the time passed on.",
"I could do it by day, when I could see what was on the ground, but in the dark the thing was beyond me.",
"To sit still would mean to wait upon death, and the waiting would not be long.",
"I could not believe my own voice.",
"There was nothing behind the tree.",
"Then from behind the fire the voice began again.",
"Sit up in the dark, waiting for something to happen!",
"She was very old, and therefore it was very hard for her to make up her mind to die.",
"For why should she die?",
"How long she had been there, or what passed there, is not for any one to say.",
"Such things have been done, though they have not often been successful.",
"It might even be that she should sleep again.",
"I remember that she had a message.",
"But whether this passed with words or without words, she could not tell.",
"I think now I would almost rather die and be done with it.",
"Pain was written in his face.",
"And if he did die in the street, what then?",
"I am in no pain.",
"Will nobody help me?",
"I put out my hand again and caught him.",
"It gets into my head in my sleep.",
"The boy had got back something like his own color.",
"This was the only female influence in the house.",
"Maybe we have no claim.",
"This is her message.",
"The time is passed, and still he is not here!",
"The tree and the rock are there at the present day.",
"Nobody knows.",
"But she did not find it easy to begin.",
"Her waiting in the room above had seemed long to her.",
"If the car passed by, well and good.",
"In this statement nearly everyone agreed with her.",
"Reach the place where we saw those men a moment since.",
"Days passed.",
"Our visit here has been perfect.",
"They might be miles from the spot!",
"The mother and sister are enough in the business.",
"The girl had turned above and was waiting in wonder.",
"He was leaving the city.",
"He could neither eat nor sleep.",
"The which was so agreed.",
"Then, as now, a world war had ended.",
"What pain is there greater than the pain that comes to the poor man in such a time?",
"I have long since passed over that.",
"He had raised his voice.",
"And he went for his gun.",
"He can see in the dark!",
"The one was, of course, dark.",
"I am not rich.",
"And only the color of his eyes and his hair made her make the comparison at all.",
"He started out to file his claim.",
"It was a clear, high music, and though the voice was light it carried the sound far.",
"She did not answer, but half of her color left her face.",
"And as she passed them.",
"Then I heard his voice.",
"I passed it to him.",
"Then I heard him calling me.",
"He looked up quickly, but caught himself, and turned his eyes away.",
"I have no time to lose.",
"Certainly he was not going to lose it now.",
"Get some sleep.",
"The room was dark.",
"The talk ended.",
"Dinner was over.",
"The house was dark.",
"She decided on a conservative course.",
"There would be time if she went fast.",
"The time for the fast day came.",
"But he let the people make their own laws.",
"Her plants all died.",
"Many people got rich by it.",
"But as he wanted more books, and had not money to buy them, he sold all of these books.",
"There was no way to get down to the floor.",
"It was far away from any houses.",
"When one of the men came down, they caught him.",
"He was never rich.",
"He now got his gun.",
"Nobody knew what it meant.",
"These set the houses on fire.",
"Then there was peace after the long war.",
"Nobody knows what killed them.",
"They could travel more easily in it.",
"He raised his gun and shot it.",
"They had never heard a gun.",
"He tried to make a small air gun for himself.",
"And sometimes he would sleep all night on the floor.",
"Then he would begin over again.",
"The father thought that putting his head into cold water would keep it from growing.",
"But he had large, dark eyes.",
"It was late, and there was nobody to be seen.",
"They cost a great deal when they were sold in this country.",
"He had already sold almost everything that he had.",
"At last the summer passed away.",
"It was dark for months and months.",
"The men might die before that time.",
"It seemed that they must die for want of food.",
"Then they might all die for want of food.",
"He wanted to find a tree.",
"The first thing he did was to get his gun.",
"It was growing dark.",
"This is not the dark side of the picture.",
"Are the figures appropriate to the subject matter?",
"Are these figures effective?",
"What, then, is the net result of our investigation?",
"When the light came back color and line were as beautiful but not the same.",
"But no one, it seemed was willing.",
"One tried to read the number and see the color.",
"To begin with, he would not have her think he made a claim.",
"She did not want to lose her power, but she wanted money.",
"She gave him her hand again and he went to sleep.",
"The whole tree is much like a heart in form, as well as color.",
"Was not this worth waiting for?",
"Hours passed.",
"One would think she was talking in her sleep.",
"She knew how to keep the pain down until he was gone.",
"Would he lose them?",
"To live in them, it would be necessary to build a house inside.",
"No, I could not sleep.",
"I passed by the last house.",
"What if she should die here?",
"With its absence came the wish for action.",
"It had gone on before, and was waiting my coming.",
"I made an effort to reach it.",
"These pass back to the general community, where they finally die.",
"In peace.",
"She had certainly got on very fast in my absence.",
"She was white with pain.",
"Here his voice failed him.",
"He said little, in a low voice, and always to one person at a time.",
"How far men go for the material of their houses!",
"So much I do claim.",
"They demand more, and get more.",
"Women are often passed over because they are not prepared.",
"What the rich do, other women will follow, is the idea.",
"He was not to be caught so easily again.",
"He knew he would not be caught that way again.",
"It was the sound for which they had been waiting.",
"It was very dark.",
"And in this he was successful.",
"They failed.",
"No head appeared above the surface of the water.",
"It was dark.",
"To this the others agreed.",
"A man appeared down the street.",
"He left her a note telling her she must get along without him.",
"The room was very dark.",
"The day for that was passed.",
"But I caught myself back in time.",
"I should like to sleep on the matter.",
"If he did, he failed to show it.",
"Ask what was said and done at their last dinner here.",
"What happened after the dinner?",
"Could he reach it?",
"Would she die?",
"We never agreed.",
"I am the least loved and so I should be the one to die.",
"And he is no longer rich, no longer independent.",
"At that signal there came a voice from out of the night.",
"By morning it would cover everything, even the fire, if he allowed it to die down.",
"A long time passed, and then she moved.",
"Food came more easily than voice.",
"They died too easily.",
"He could hear her voice.",
"He wanted to reach it.",
"And then he heard the voice!",
"He felt no very great pain.",
"And then, all at once, she saw that they were leaving her.",
"But the pain was mostly gone.",
"Across this not one of them passed.",
"Not until he was in new country did he begin his search.",
"Even under the tree there was no sign of him left.",
"I thought to lose my reason.",
"For them I die.",
"Some days passed thus.",
"They built houses until there was a great city.",
"They found an old woman who had some money, upon which she was sitting.",
"A man died, leaving a son.",
"They went toward the houses, each his own way.",
"The city appeared at the very spot.",
"How that long night passed I cannot well say.",
"He had his peace to make with his wife and he would make it.",
"Words failed him.",
"That was why he could not go to sleep!",
"How much he needed sleep!",
"He who has lost all has nothing to lose.",
"This time, however, she was successful, and did call to mind one that she had not thought of before.",
"Her voice, did I say?",
"Had she sent me no message?",
"Well, he produced his message too late.",
"He appeared in a moment.",
"What claim had I upon her?",
"I looked at him for a moment without understanding.",
"What passed?",
"But the more he had to build with, the less he wanted to build.",
"Lose her not!",
"We tried again and failed.",
"I begin to see my way.",
"For the next few hours they are good for nothing but rest, though sleep is generally hard to get.",
"Where to begin?",
"Nobody has any idea to this day why those men were shot.",
"As fast as we sent them off, others came in.",
"My sister!",
"Peace be with him.",
"Here it was in the dark.",
"Had she used these to keep watch upon that spot?",
"But I am leaving.",
"Already, too, she can begin to hear.",
"The move was so far successful.",
"But time passed away and they never appeared again.",
"Several hours passed away.",
"This will floor him.",
"I went to sleep.",
"Both correct.",
"They are rich, are they not?",
"Then for a few days nothing happened, except that everyone seemed to have caught a cold.",
"I think that one may be enough for tonight.",
"Now we begin to understand each other.",
"Had she been about to thank me?",
"And yet, here they were calling on my father.",
"He was willing to risk nothing.",
"And it is growing dark.",
"Can it be that I have failed in everything?",
"Only one of us will die.",
"At any rate, we are on firm ground now.",
"This message was brought to her in a letter one day.",
"What passed there we know not for certain.",
"But if we begin to try, that, we find, is just what we cannot do.",
"Let us begin with a very simple example.",
"It may possibly have been written much later.",
"His laws will be like his character.",
"If he be good, he will make good laws.",
"If he be bad, he will make bad laws.",
"Through the wife, he must reach the husband.",
"Through the mother, he must reach the children.",
"Somebody must always be rich, why should not I?",
"Peace, peace!",
"Another hour passed.",
"After dinner they took a walk through the pretty town and were caught in the dark before they could get back.",
"Indeed, they soon became fast friends.",
"I have no gun, for I do not like gun.",
"So after a time I die here.",
"It takes so much from them, as there was a common link.",
"There they were, and seemed to have been sitting all the week.",
"Perhaps it is too much to expect that such things should die out all at once.",
"He found the door fast.",
"Allow me a few words on each of these subjects.",
"In any event, this is the medium we work with.",
"But he agreed to live there.",
"They never knew the pain it caused him.",
"Today I am going to die.",
"It was nearly time to begin to look for it.",
"In these efforts it was highly successful.",
"It was from the first highly successful.",
"It is all perfect peace.",
"Day after day passed on, and she still lived.",
"Since it is so, let him not die!",
"She was very useful in telling me what every thing was.",
"This figure is his sister.",
"It was almost dark.",
"If the voice may win love, why not the hair?",
"That man will die.",
"It is no use living here unless one is rich and beautiful and popular.",
"It was quite dark.",
"Of late music had failed her a little.",
"With her title and position to hold to, she could face the world.",
"There was not much understanding there.",
"Without it was dark and still.",
"The day passed as such days do.",
"And there the question ended.",
"It was now dinner time.",
"And there was something like fear in her voice.",
"But he knew he had been less than successful.",
"Nobody else can do that.",
"But what is it willing to do and able to do, and what will the town let it do?",
"We have the figures.",
"It was agreed that the list should be started.",
"Some are very children in their love of color.",
"We have no rich, and no really poor.",
"But to go back to the trip itself.",
"Nobody knew, exactly.",
"But on the spot nobody could talk that way.",
"At length, in taking leave, he takes also from the table the letter to which he had no claim.",
"Always take care that the fire is very regular.",
"When they are quite firm, take them out and put them into very cold water.",
"So small, so perfect!",
"But she held it out of my reach.",
"Nothing has changed except to improve.",
"He never for a moment questions his perfect understanding of it, and of all it has got to say for itself.",
"A great many never knew whom they had to thank for this.",
"All children hold out their feet sometimes to trip each other.",
"He was quite certain that it went there, but nobody seems to know who was in it.",
"Soon they were to become more perfect still for us.",
"They thought that even one day together would be perfect for everyone.",
"Nobody is allowed to go in.",
"If his sister is well again, she has to go away, too.",
"He was sitting all alone under a big tree.",
"So good a business man to lose the chance that comes once only in a life!",
"Nobody could.",
"He and I could never had got at a basis peace.",
"There was no possible way to reach them.",
"In the day of test it failed.",
"I started for them and soon caught up with them.",
"It seems years ago that we lived in a time of peace.",
"The figures are approximately correct.",
"Only one appeared.",
"People were telling each other the war was over.",
"This at last is peace.",
"I myself know this, having passed them but now.",
"In the way of houses, it is still some miles short of them.",
"Then he went home to dinner.",
"I caught hold of her and asked her to tell me more.",
"At least, I would die hard.",
"Apparently they were agreed, for they asked me if I were ready now to come with them.",
"He then prepared himself to die.",
"I have observed that they are all conservative.",
"We are still waiting to see what will become of him.",
"Peace to all such!",
"He sets in blood no more.",
"I hear not the voice of my love!",
"Here is the rock, and here the tree!",
"Here is the tree and the rock.",
"I die!",
"Let us do or die!",
"Big, build.",
"Sets, patterns.",
"People were still at peace and yet already at war.",
"After all, I thought, it might easily be worse.",
"I had to reach this line, and having reached it, to remain for some time above it.",
"The attack failed.",
"The night was dark and cool.",
"That trying moment passed.",
"And why that should be so interested her intelligence.",
"He had been sitting down, talking to the men.",
"When he got beyond the light he turned and went back to a position where in the dark he could watch without being seen.",
"They passed him.",
"She wanted to thank him.",
"All was well that ended well.",
"Not one could find a voice.",
"He carried a gun.",
"It appeared, indeed, that they had all gone.",
"Indeed, when the moment came he found that speech was difficult and his voice not natural.",
"It was just about dark when her father called.",
"There was color in his face.",
"I saw the gun.",
"When the papers had been passed back to the leader he read them.",
"But he failed.",
"Day after day passed.",
"It was dark just now when I came below.",
"Some will lose sleep at night.",
"I lose sleep at night from thinking so hard.",
"It was coming fast.",
"It must be intelligence seeing the higher.",
"The moment seemed one beyond her understanding.",
"At last a car appeared, coming fast.",
"The light of day failed.",
"They expected him to die long ago.",
"Now he might die any minute.",
"I took good care not to lose it a second time.",
"It is said that she changes color.",
"His few words were, however, very telling.",
"She is the most conservative person I ever met.",
"There was no dark at all!",
"That was all her message to me, yet quite enough.",
"Now make fast.",
"It was a moment before she could control her voice.",
"I must reach these and learn who they are.",
"Leave me to die in peace.",
"So the night passed.",
"Each article had its regular place where it would take up the least possible space.",
"Some little time passed thus.",
"Would he take the message?",
"If she could only sleep!",
"Perhaps the end of it would be that she would die.",
"She was sitting up, watching him.",
"He was calling to her!",
"So the hours passed.",
"Would he begin to see, that she was at least, and at last, trying?",
"A pattern, or that with reference to which a thing is made.",
"One happy thought has passed across my mind.",
"Alone, I cannot fear to die.",
"To keep what we have, we must improve it from year to year.",
"Even if she could not control her face, she could control her voice.",
"She has no claim on her home, nor on her children.",
"The reason these laws have been left the way they are, is that no one knows about them.",
"Everything could begin life over again.",
"What had she done, or failed to do?",
"I was willing to see.",
"Could he but reach it!",
"We could not tell the color of his eyes, as they were not open.",
"They were rich people and had a great deal of company.",
"There were some people sitting about the room, and, from their talk, I found out what had taken place.",
"We passed the school on our way.",
"Months passed away, and nothing was heard of him.",
"Her voice failed.",
"The rich and poor met together.",
"Then the voice was heard.",
"I know not the new laws.",
"Was it the voice of a human?",
"But of what kind of plants?",
"In addition they find it necessary to sleep during the day.",
"The other that it is higher in the female sex than in the male.",
"She was not to die as she had lived.",
"We have learned how to control and change our environment.",
"I was just sitting here when I heard a step.",
"If they have the will for peace, it is peace.",
"What will happen to it when peace comes no man can tell.",
"There is our common agreement.",
"Nice little net!",
"By and by is easily said.",
"All is fish that comes to the net.",
"Who saw him die?",
"Who caught his blood?",
"Thus I do not die.",
"Hear my voice!",
"I felt that way after I passed my second class tests.",
"Just then I heard a voice.",
"Then something told her to feel about again on the floor.",
"A few minutes passed.",
"She is my sister.",
"They make it for the rest of us, so easily!",
"He failed, at once and for all.",
"It was my turn, but he was willing enough.",
"But father is calling me.",
"I had nothing to do and I was in the dark.",
"I failed as many a woman has failed.",
"She was too happy to sleep that night.",
"Had she ever known anything that was not peace?",
"She must be waiting for something.",
"For all that is worth anything in me I have to thank him.",
"The hour was ended at last, and she was free.",
"If he might only know that she was waiting for him to come back to bring it to her.",
"She had gone home, as she always wanted to go, in her sleep.",
"Everybody wanted to know what was the matter, but nobody could answer the question.",
"I had the firm make them to order, so there is nothing else like them on the market.",
"There are very few who can easily think of these things of themselves.",
"And that change and that growth are as easy for the poor as for the rich, and as necessary for the rich as for the poor.",
"He had made his first trial, and failed.",
"How did it get into that black spot?",
"They are books of history and of laws.",
"His work is perfect.",
"They were willing enough to go together to do this difficult thing.",
"Talk was his commercial medium and staff of life.",
"He found one critical spot.",
"The gun was no longer a gun.",
"He goes for his gun.",
"Sitting talking like they was one age.",
"That weight on his back failed to leave him.",
"He was never caught.",
"Can the heart reach it before it die?",
"They all went out as fast as they could.",
"There is no telling what the poor dog would have done if a little girl had not come along just then.",
"If she was to lose that son she would have no child left.",
"Perhaps she will then leave me in peace.",
"Nobody has been to see me.",
"Nobody could tell.",
"All the papers pass through my hands, and nobody could know more than I know myself.",
"He had passed.",
"It was the other half of himself that was about to die.",
"They agreed very well together.",
"She called nobody since she knew that nobody would come.",
"They failed to get these terms, why has not been made public.",
"They were successful.",
"Why die I not therefore?",
"For him we live, for him we mean to die.",
"What, must I die?",
"Fight for me or die?",
"With all my heart I willing am to learn.",
"Nobody yet.",
"Peace, peace.",
"I reach it him?",
"So they passed the night, with his hand upon her head.",
"My sister got away none too soon.",
"He would have gotten over that by this time.",
"There was apparently no demand.",
"Few of the cars would run long or fast.",
"He was making others rich.",
"Indeed, for the moment it so appeared.",
"Our laws still deal with us on the basis of the old system.",
"What this country needs, above everything else, is a body of laws which will look after the men who are on the make rather than the men who are already made.",
"General peace followed.",
"They are never waiting for something to turn up.",
"It will be almost dark.",
"I thought it was the voice of a friend.",
"Was he rich?",
"We do not know the laws of that country.",
"We thank them for nothing.",
"We are older than we were, and age is easily put out of its way.",
"Possibly he did not.",
"They agreed.",
"I agreed.",
"It ended in nothing.",
"Debate on the address.",
"A future day was agreed to.",
"It passed in the negative.",
"A voice was heard from within.",
"There appeared a great want of water.",
"It was said that he is very rich, and could well find the money.",
"I had no pain.",
"Time passed in talk after dinner.",
"Every day will improve another.",
"Many of those present appeared to enjoy this song.",
"It seemed to be a common understanding.",
"This was not much, but it was enough to sleep on.",
"She knew his voice, as she did that of nearly everyone with whom she had ever been brought in contact.",
"The woman was waiting for her money, and I asked her.",
"I passed a season between them.",
"But a single individual appeared.",
"Not so with her sister.",
"But these means sometimes failed.",
"And that very wish gave her a peace she had never felt before.",
"They have been known to die for it.",
"He not only knew what he wanted for his country but also how to live for his country and how to die for his country.",
"I have no written records of my past life.",
"What became of him I know not, nor how long he lived, but he was a great deal older than I was, and must have passed away many years ago.",
"Sister had come over with her husband and the baby.",
"On the left, however, he was more successful.",
"My car is waiting at the door now.",
"The man took down the message.",
"He passed on almost at once, in search of some one else.",
"It was a wonderful thing, this message.",
"Once more it had not failed him.",
"He felt the sleep already upon his eyes.",
"I can live or I can die, just by myself.",
"His voice was firm.",
"I am going to take her out and give her a little dinner directly.",
"I was beginning to lose heart.",
"The light had failed.",
"She seemed to be waiting to hear what else he had to say.",
"The old days are passed.",
"He passed out.",
"It was an hour before they thought of leaving the table.",
"A minute may have passed, not more.",
"Nobody else was near us.",
"A month passed.",
"I meant to do more, more than was agreed on.",
"The day passed.",
"We must die to live.",
"One day the dog got caught.",
"The week that followed passed quickly.",
"Nature contains him not.",
"Up above in perfect light.",
"This appears to me perfect.",
"These were the laws of human nature, by which, as it seemed to me, I had been brought to my present state.",
"Was he waiting there still?",
"Was he going to lose her?",
"I saw that if I had not been rich, the daughter of a rich man, I should have been of no account in their eyes.",
"The title will come.",
"Something in his voice told her that she had made a wrong step, that she had failed.",
"Dark hair, light eyes.",
"He caught at the hope, small though it was.",
"They had been sitting talking for nearly an hour.",
"As to the body he made male and female.",
"He said that his wife was his sister.",
"I am very sure about her voice and expression, because I know her character.",
"There was not a minute to lose.",
"There was not a moment to lose.",
"What were they waiting for?",
"These words put an end to the debate.",
"What passed within me at that moment?",
"The night was dark.",
"Not being able to sleep, I got up.",
"Was all that was being done quite correct?",
"Oil upon fire.",
"But they always begin at some particular point.",
"He passed by.",
"The fire had caught.",
"We passed through it.",
"We were in a room on the ground floor.",
"The street was no longer completely dark.",
"We passed by the dead old man.",
"They left them to die there.",
"It is a dark spot.",
"Where should I sleep?",
"She was waiting for me.",
"The night was very dark.",
"In the name of what laws?",
"And he went to sleep.",
"Where will he begin?",
"The subjects under its discussion became popular.",
"Night sports?",
"To that we all are willing.",
"His friends, how easily they had given him up!",
"But the years passed, and the children went away.",
"He looked upon her with the full intelligence of a great relationship for the first time in his life.",
"Neither knew how near the other was, and the years passed by.",
"Months passed.",
"The episode was ended.",
"There had been no pain until he moved.",
"Her health was not perfect.",
"He had reached the remains of the dinner.",
"Time passed and no one appeared.",
"So there it ended.",
"The details are not worth telling, and I therefore pass them by.",
"It was by working easily that I got through so much.",
"It was then we began to plan the home we should build.",
"The title to the house was clear.",
"There was nobody to be there, he said, but his wife and daughter.",
"This will account for some things in the form of each message.",
"Great would be the peace of her children.",
"After what rule and pattern?",
"He tried to right himself, but failed.",
"He could not possibly imagine its use or value.",
"Nobody wants me.",
"He was putting ahead for dear life.",
"He was sure now that there was nobody at home.",
"He thought fast.",
"But, since we do it all that the children may learn to do, and, through doing, to be, can we ever possibly do too much?",
"I lost no time in putting it into practice.",
"But whatever the children lose when they are small, they find again when they come to a larger growth.",
"The little girl was quite correct.",
"I did not find it so easily.",
"Add to that the other fact of his leaving at night.",
"Thus ended the first legal campaign.",
"Why did they keep him waiting so long?",
"We passed at that time in the car.",
"A message was being received.",
"Since that moment he had caught no sound from her.",
"She must have caught something of what had been going on.",
"The hours that seemed days passed.",
"Several days passed.",
"But nobody could have looked at him and called him old.",
"In that time a message was given and received.",
"Not anymore.",
"Between them passed speech without words.",
"If she did, nobody would hear her.",
"I caught her.",
"He would travel fast.",
"Outside it was dark.",
"She might sleep without fear.",
"He was moving fast.",
"None appeared.",
"He would never reach them.",
"He could not travel fast.",
"Nobody does.",
"The human voice sure sounds good up here.",
"Nobody in his right mind went to the great water at this time of year.",
"Nobody had ever called him a patient man.",
"Nobody like him had ever come into her life.",
"Nor did she keep me waiting.",
"Nobody was there.",
"I meant to die.",
"I could see it in his eyes, hear it in his voice.",
"Drive fast, please.",
"It is perfect.",
"I was leaving nothing to chance.",
"But the room was dark.",
"The first point is that there is not so very much difference in the intelligence of people after all.",
"But now I begin to understand why their lives are so difficult.",
"She can change the color of her hair, for example.",
"I have to be kind and understanding toward their needs.",
"He appeared already dead.",
"I can easily say no to all those things.",
"It is dark.",
"He will go to the tree, and watch for him to come out.",
"If she will leave them in peace, they will leave her in peace.",
"He was in pain all over.",
"Dinner and a show.",
"Leaving her own mother.",
"I was sitting the same as there.",
"Nobody paid any attention to her.",
"They passed into the street.",
"How little else was in there, nobody knew.",
"None of this family were sold to the same person except my wife and one sister.",
"It seems that those who bought the other members of the family were not so particular, and were willing to run the risk.",
"In a short time I heard her calling me to come to her.",
"I had gotten further away than any of them.",
"But sleep would not come to her.",
"Well, possibly.",
"It is very difficult to live with people who act like that, and nobody can love them.",
"The dinner was over.",
"We must take some day when everybody is at home, and everybody willing to work.",
"He may wish, too, to send some message to his father.",
"This was telling but half the story.",
"She had then thought that the spot might one day be wanted.",
"An hour passed, and he did not come.",
"She gave a little start, as she heard his voice.",
"Her story was ended.",
"Of course, this is not the tree my relative means.",
"Its message, of course, is heard as well as read.",
"During this long talk a good deal of time had passed.",
"He wanted to go to sleep.",
"The house had been sold.",
"I can sleep here.",
"And even if I could, there is another reason for the trip.",
"Why was he waiting around for anyway?",
"She was leaving him!",
"Our waiting is over.",
"And he seemed so kind and was going to be rich.",
"Nobody will go behind that.",
"If he failed now he was lost indeed.",
"Something which did not come easily.",
"His voice, lower still.",
"But the waiting was not quite the same.",
"Only a mother and sister.",
"She saw nobody because she looked for only one.",
"She was probably in great pain.",
"She will sleep for a long time yet.",
"Where could she possibly get the stuff?",
"Going to lose her soon.",
"Looking back, she could see that it had been a happy life, and the future looked so dark.",
"Well, where was he sitting, then?",
"He was caught!",
"Certainly nobody could see her here.",
"It is too perfect, too beautiful!",
"Nobody in this country, at any rate.",
"He met him coming down, and gave him the message.",
"The chief agreed with his man.",
"That was done easily.",
"There was no common basis on which to build.",
"Whether they ever did reach him I do not know.",
"Unless something is done we will be here for many weeks, possibly for months.",
"The whole world wants peace.",
"He has failed to do so.",
"From his point of view a statement, such as I was willing to make, would in no way help the situation.",
"They demand both.",
"The conditions of environment were different from what they were before or what they are now.",
"The message was a very long one.",
"But minute passed after minute and there was no sign of them.",
"There is a certain system to it, but it is one which a lost man, if he were in the dark, could not possibly find out.",
"Coming in, as he did, from the street, the room was quite dark to his eyes, and he could not well make out, at first, who were in it.",
"He had never before heard of a dinner being worth so much money.",
"But there was no time to lose.",
"For some reason they were late in getting away, but, once started, they seemed to be going fast enough to make up for lost time.",
"He was willing and more than willing to do so.",
"He had been willing to do what was right.",
"But he met and passed them all.",
"Yes, it was dark, very dark.",
"We gave him as good a dinner as we could.",
"There were several here waiting for him as patients.",
"Company at dinner.",
"There was, however, no stay on any other terms, than of sitting up all night.",
"If there are who do not read him, it is full time they should begin.",
"There is no room in them just now for the home he is leaving.",
"She looked from one sister to the other.",
"He is a nobody!",
"Its form is not easily described.",
"It is this that gives the great variety in color.",
"A year passed away.",
"But am I not rich enough for him?",
"Green, and so the matter ended.",
"How fast the year is going by!",
"Never do we sleep!",
"Must I die, now?",
"Die, then!",
"One night he thought that some one was calling to him in his sleep.",
"I am about to die!",
"Many years passed.",
"So when it was passed he turned and came away home.",
"He looks like a regular man to me.",
"Has a strong debate with him on this subject.",
"Some people improve upon us.",
"It might cost me the peace of my whole life, at this time, to move for her.",
"If I do, nobody else will.",
"I think I will begin my operations the moment she comes in.",
"At last, I will begin, thought I.",
"She could not possibly see me yet, was her answer.",
"I came in to dinner.",
"But the patterns she would not open.",
"How could he ever sleep?",
"They had only let him sleep as long as he would.",
"Up and up they went, until they came to a little room high in the tree.",
"But he did not sleep for a long while.",
"I do not see that color makes much difference with animals, why should it make so much difference among men?",
"It was quite on the top of the tree.",
"She felt that it must be so when she heard him talk at dinner.",
"It is right that the rich should help those who want.",
"It must be very fine to be rich.",
"I am rich!",
"He should not sleep.",
"With them I will begin.",
"If so they be not gotten up already.",
"Peace, stay!",
"But peace!",
"He is sure to die.",
"A man can do anything with a woman if he sets about it the right way.",
"I tried to, but failed.",
"The war is ended.",
"He would lose his eyes for it, no matter how rich he were.",
"I must sleep.",
"I do not know this title.",
"The moment passed.",
"And so the weeks passed, and the months, and the years.",
"So indeed it appeared.",
"Am I to die like a dog?",
"One thing gave her peace.",
"She told him how he had sold everything.",
"Had his reason failed him?",
"In a low voice he read the intelligence to his wife.",
"But she did not look as if she were willing to help him.",
"But he could not sleep.",
"He could have brought his wife and sister together, but he had not tried to do it.",
"Her face was dark red.",
"Not this trip.",
"But he did not go to sleep.",
"Had he known what the future held in store he might have gone after his gun.",
"He was not fast enough, and he knew it.",
"The house was of course dark.",
"But he would have to work fast.",
"There was no telling where it was.",
"His face was a dark red.",
"Why, what a huge tree this is!",
"For nobody would play with him, and he knew full well why.",
"Money, of course, passed, but not very much.",
"We loved them in peace and we loved them in war.",
"Nobody can do more than that.",
"Our countries were at peace.",
"Make peace?",
"So the day passed.",
"It would seem that he read nothing in the message.",
"Possibly, too, there was some special need to be met.",
"But he can only have been last seen at one of the places, whereas the remains have been found at both places.",
"They were all dark.",
"What is it that the police are waiting for?",
"With him the end of life was reason and intelligence.",
"More important things demand our attention.",
"Very possibly.",
"So far it has been very successful.",
"Begin right, in early life.",
"How it is caused.",
"Number of hours required for sleep.",
"Begin right.",
"And yet he is said to enjoy the most perfect health.",
"But it is more or less perfect, in different individuals, according to the early education they have received.",
"Still nothing appeared.",
"The color?",
"I have come to dinner.",
"To begin with me.",
"I wonder, whom they take for a pattern!",
"How much more than is necessary do we spend in sleep?",
"The intelligence reached my father.",
"There was little sleep among them all that night.",
"The room in question is the back room on the first floor.",
"No part of this work has yet appeared.",
"To come back to my sister.",
"It was not until his age brought him in contact with others, that there seemed to be any difference between his nature and the common race of children.",
"Up to this time not a paid message had been sent.",
"Its message could be received only by those in the direct line of the light.",
"Thus it is in every calling of life.",
"It did good service for several years, and was then sold.",
"His sister and the other children looked in and saw him.",
"I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.",
"Something of this sort was, I think, agreed on.",
"Things that could only show themselves and die.",
"No sleep.",
"I know their pain.",
"They are waiting to see the company pass out.",
"Much may happen before I die!",
"He died on the spot.",
"Then we must soon begin.",
"Why should not I sleep?",
"A look of pain comes into his face.",
"Ask her what has passed?",
"What had passed?",
"I would rather die!",
"It is very dark.",
"My mother waiting.",
"Many hours had passed.",
"Nothing passed between them, nothing.",
"The money agreed upon has been paid over to me.",
"The public voice is with us to a man.",
"Is there no peace in this house?",
"Nothing is perfect in this world.",
"Nobody at first.",
"Nobody there.",
"He has taken on with his sister since then, and goes to see her very often.",
"The rest are all of them from studies taken upon the spot.",
"After long waiting he will certainly find one door open, and go through it.",
"Let me not die before my peace be made!",
"They appeared at last.",
"The end, none the less, was that what he had expected failed to come to him.",
"To each and all, the peace that was not mine.",
"And then I passed into this life.",
"He appeared to be a man of few words, if any.",
"Then I went my way, leaving my heart behind.",
"He may therefore pass for nobody.",
"Why did she not go to sleep?",
"Every one of her efforts to find the door had failed.",
"She had no peace.",
"Nobody ever knew while he lived.",
"But the perfect wife may know them.",
"It will be no trouble at all to reach the surface.",
"Nobody else ever comes there.",
"Nobody else knows anything about it.",
"Why should they sleep?",
"So the days passed.",
"And he did not want to die.",
"His health is perfect.",
"He cannot build a new road, for there is no ground on which he can build it.",
"Yet it must be correct.",
"No one was ever known to die a natural death.",
"At night they sleep there.",
"All white men caught them.",
"Nobody knows what it is.",
"Stand fast in it.",
"Live in peace with one another.",
"He never raised his voice to me.",
"I did not want to die.",
"It is a big telling, but I am telling everything.",
"Die and be done with it.",
"And we did it in the dark!",
"And we had done this thing in the dark!",
"Everything he had said was correct.",
"She had passed without pain.",
"In this respect they have always, and in all countries, failed.",
"What claim had they to be there?",
"Now I ask nobody.",
"After some years had passed he married out there, and she married.",
"Nobody was asked to meet her.",
"It was fast.",
"I felt it hard that I had yet to die.",
"It failed once.",
"Peace be with him!",
"The world passed on.",
"Now the only people who will come for nothing are those we used to think of paying to stay away.",
"Nobody knows what island that is?",
"In fact, last night I went to sleep immediately after dinner, or very nearly so.",
"I have so perfect an idea out of that song!",
"Now that the cold has gone again, I continue to keep well in body, and already I begin to walk a little more.",
"She has just been here to thank me, and has left me very happy.",
"The laws of nature are in open war with me.",
"But I begin to have more hope in the story line, and that should improve my income anyway.",
"This to be read with a big voice.",
"That is our dinner party.",
"I begin to fear it.",
"When I come to think of it, I do not know what I said to his sister, and I fear to try again.",
"That is how stories should begin.",
"As for not giving a reduction, what are we?",
"Why did I hold my peace?",
"He will begin to return to us in the course of time, as he was and as we loved him.",
"To die.",
"To sleep.",
"Peace, peace, old heart!",
"And I expected that both sets of people would turn to me for an answer to this.",
"And all these people work hard all day long and every day, so that I may be able to talk and eat and sleep.",
"How do the rich order their lives there?",
"There were no houses and no people.",
"How very few points of contact it is possible to have!",
"And more than peace."],

["The last words he was heard to speak in this world were these.",
"But why should I speak of all those men, and such men?",
"Now, as I looked, I began to realize upon what sort of a place I had come.",
"For the moment, I did not realize.",
"Here, I found that it was possible to see under it, for a distance of nearly a couple of feet.",
"Through the trees, I saw it, and then it was above the trees.",
"Her voice seemed to come to me from a distance.",
"In my heart, I have no doubt.",
"He talked a great deal at dinner.",
"He came to dinner one night, and we talked the thing over.",
"One day he writes a book.",
"But that it is real, who can doubt?",
"Can a man receive an education outside of himself?",
"No one absolutely sets price.",
"Just enough education to learn to read and write and count.",
"But for some forms of work, men and women receive an income, and nothing more.",
"I know absolutely nothing.",
"We did not speak to him.",
"But the men were affected, too.",
"I examined the lot with interest.",
"That was my opinion.",
"No one expressed an opinion.",
"He examined the staff.",
"Seen from a distance, it would never be taken for a tree of any kind.",
"And did each one of them expect to enjoy that advantage for which I came here?",
"I am just ready to speak of it.",
"Subjects like these might be worked out to advantage.",
"He must make a stand somewhere, and he makes it here.",
"I could not speak.",
"How well she would carry it off!",
"Perhaps, sometimes, she really missed him a little.",
"She has gone to bed.",
"She speak to me.",
"She had no wish to create an effect, but she found it difficult to speak.",
"She talked with many people about it.",
"He talked so that everyone could understand him.",
"They had a brother.",
"He was going to carry it away!",
"A tree fell the wrong way and hit him.",
"She had talked back to their chief who had the power to kill her.",
"The chief talked with some of his men.",
"Because of what she had done then, he was now at her feet asking her to make peace.",
"She could not go around speaking any more.",
"She could walk only a few steps.",
"She wanted to carry on her work there.",
"But she was not strong enough to carry out her idea.",
"When it came time for her to speak, she found it hard to talk.",
"At last he turns.",
"His second attempt he was determined must be successful.",
"But there was one man who determined to do it, or die in the attempt.",
"A door is open wide.",
"I wanna stay home and think.",
"Cut me to pieces to give him what he needs to make him live.",
"He examined into every thing.",
"Every one had a religious training.",
"No doubt.",
"About the girl there could be no doubt.",
"There was no doubt now as to who he was.",
"Had she a brother?",
"However, this is not a newspaper report, is it?",
"She was absolutely still.",
"She was absolutely alone.",
"We must raise money in some way.",
"As to the trouble, of course we do not count that.",
"Real education goes very deep.",
"It is wonderful what a saving of time it is.",
"He was the first to speak.",
"She thinks no one else knows anything.",
"Every day we missed her about the same time, and they always found her in the same place, down by the green road.",
"There was just one left in camp.",
"And they all took turns.",
"His heart fell down.",
"Would anybody here sell fish?",
"They talked for some time.",
"Me kid.",
"She had seemed at least that at a distance.",
"The next day the news was all over camp.",
"From now on he fell more and more behind.",
"Everybody talked at once.",
"People talked.",
"They carry him off!",
"Why, speak to her first.",
"And that I long to be in bed?",
"Brother, come back.",
"Not speak with me!",
"Let me then speak first.",
"Why, what do I speak like?",
"So he set about his labor of love.",
"I am not fit to be his mother.",
"They did not speak.",
"Animals speak, well why not, we can!",
"I suggested that they should see how many kinds they could find.",
"All getting of experience is active, but some kinds more obviously than others.",
"This was the first time I ever had my head examined.",
"But I saw it was time for me to be speaking up.",
"Here I saw him more clearly, and I began to doubt.",
"I did not attempt to sleep.",
"One thing I noted, that there were no women in the camp.",
"At the last minute she had asked the other girls to go with her.",
"The girls loved it, for it was a pretty place.",
"Nor was she with anybody, for that matter.",
"As far as the girls knew, she had not one friend in the whole school.",
"The girls looked at each other.",
"The girls had not.",
"And as she had predicted, they did have the time of their lives.",
"Night, girls.",
"And it was the middle of the night with everybody in bed!",
"Time did not count with her as with common men.",
"She would not allow me to speak.",
"I have no doubt at all on that subject.",
"We count only by what happens to us.",
"I am not fit to die.",
"I could get up out of bed and walk about.",
"I could walk any distance.",
"I am not fit for it.",
"Is he the judge between good and evil?",
"The night is black like hell, and there comes no morning.",
"Say nothing to the men or to anybody.",
"This the girls could not understand.",
"He went on speaking all the time.",
"There must be wrong somewhere, but where?",
"We had to carry him to his bed.",
"He applied for more.",
"Above, no saving hand!",
"I went to bed.",
"He thinks that they come to take him away.",
"There was no doubt.",
"He had no doubt at all of my coming back!",
"To whom we speak.",
"That would, speaking generally, be my plan.",
"He tried to speak.",
"The shot must have been a random one.",
"That is as much as a man can speak for.",
"He must carry out the final measures alone.",
"She tried to speak.",
"She must speak with him.",
"Is the other man his brother?",
"He is a man with ideas of his own.",
"I am not speaking of knowledge, but rather of the current thought of the living generation.",
"Missed him.",
"But it might rise again.",
"Who mentioned money?",
"Not once did he speak until he saw that all was well.",
"Bad characters.",
"And the prices for labor!",
"She did not speak.",
"She was quite content.",
"But in the end he gave his brother up to death.",
"But the girl could not speak.",
"I thought it was a cat at first.",
"Always like a cat.",
"She could not speak.",
"I saw what he was driving at.",
"No doubt I had been working too hard.",
"After that, there could be no further doubt.",
"They were coming under the trees now.",
"There must be a law somewhere.",
"I cannot live again behind the screen, for too long have I been independent.",
"The first thing the people had to do was to cut down the trees.",
"She showed the people how to raise another plant.",
"The boy offered to board himself if his brother would give him half what it cost to pay for his board.",
"They lived in a camp.",
"But the man that was with his brother was killed.",
"His brother got away.",
"That was because he was so hard to catch.",
"His brother did not get back at the time he had set for coming.",
"He looked through the trees.",
"After a long time they got her into deep water.",
"He wanted to get used to a hard bed.",
"He never seemed to know when anybody came or went.",
"He would tell his brother what he had been reading.",
"Many girls were sent to her school.",
"She told the judge about it.",
"How does it affect the meaning of the word?",
"A person who does not take the trouble to speak clearly has not taken the trouble to think clearly.",
"Through long study of them and what they indicate.",
"In each instance how is the meaning affected?",
"Most men are willing to receive what is due them.",
"Name the different kinds of schools.",
"Many of the words are absolutely new so far as this book is concerned.",
"Life was not all labor.",
"The house was old and had been at one time rich and powerful.",
"The loss cut too deep.",
"Her brother was with her.",
"It seemed that I should never catch it.",
"I went a little of the distance across the street.",
"These do not come without thought and labor.",
"The day of civil war was over.",
"If they could not speak with him, they could at least speak of him.",
"And yet labor we must have.",
"Of course they are content.",
"Mention food and the average man thinks of mother.",
"Food is short and expensive because labor is short.",
"He was speaking to an audience of working women.",
"But conditions now are absolutely different.",
"They fell to it again.",
"The man fell to the ground without a sound.",
"While still some distance from the water, there was a shot from below.",
"They might be deep in the water and they might be close to the surface.",
"When they came home we all went to bed.",
"Exposure of what?",
"He followed me and talked to me against my will.",
"If I asked myself this question, I did not answer it, but I doubt if I asked it then.",
"Then doubt came.",
"One fact was mentioned which set me thinking.",
"I was the first to speak.",
"He was ready to speak before I was.",
"I have seen the fact mentioned, but without comment.",
"Neither meant to lose the advantage of the moment.",
"Then her eyes fell on me.",
"This we know, absolutely.",
"But I do not ask that person to speak.",
"Remember the man I mentioned.",
"I did not stop to wonder, or ask why she was there, or to whom she was speaking.",
"I heard him getting ready to go out, and I wanted to speak to him before he went.",
"But I could not speak, I could not answer her.",
"I could speak now.",
"I thought I had heard my sister speak!",
"But something had come to take the place of that which he missed.",
"They were in camp.",
"She did not speak to him.",
"They met breast to breast.",
"One of them missed.",
"He turns away no one who comes to him.",
"Going out of the house he met the bad one, who wanted to carry the letter himself.",
"Then he began to count in another way.",
"Government caused the effects of this man, who had no family, to be examined, and a list of them to be made out.",
"But I believe I also mentioned that in the house in which she lived there were other poor people.",
"What could he do to content her?",
"As for the rest, it is yet too soon to judge.",
"And I realize too late that it was for me, and not for him, to speak that word.",
"Well, we talked and talked.",
"Hell could hold no worse.",
"But hope fell as I read on.",
"I must play my last card.",
"Raise her again!",
"Why raise me any more?",
"That may have been an advantage in one way.",
"Who would look at offers of money then?",
"There is absolutely nothing to be got here.",
"And so, indeed, it fell out.",
"The result might have been predicted.",
"When in doubt, try it on the dog!",
"I think they have been wrong almost as often as they had predicted.",
"It was the first time he had mentioned her.",
"In all the years I had known them, not one had looked at me, or given me a civil word, and indeed, they had little reason to give one.",
"It turns into a simple matter, after all.",
"She seemed about to speak again, but she did not.",
"Even now I do not know what made me speak, save that she was going.",
"There was some advantage, too, in this species of stage wait.",
"He went to bed rather early, but could not sleep until the small hours.",
"The street was wide.",
"In later years they often talked of that first meeting.",
"When in bed he could not sleep there.",
"This meant civil war.",
"It is to them I speak.",
"If only we be fit for it.",
"But for that very reason it may be the more fit to be asked, once and for all.",
"We are not here to judge these people, or any people.",
"Let us be content with it.",
"They are willing enough to go there, because they know that they must go somewhere.",
"But with what are they not content?",
"That is a question worth asking.",
"No doubt it is so written, my friends.",
"But only for a time may they thus think and speak.",
"Of them I do not speak here.",
"Of this we were not left long in doubt.",
"Though he alone knew where to find it, he could only receive it from the hand of another.",
"The letter asking me to visit her was the first I have ever received from her.",
"Write as religious a letter as possible, but no mention of what is gone and done with.",
"I did not let this carry me, though, too far.",
"But I did not sleep well, and I must come back to my own bed.",
"She talked of the law.",
"The committee had many cases of this kind.",
"A brother and sister lived together here.",
"He could not speak.",
"The rock fell to the ground, out of reach.",
"Wait until I tell my little brother about all of this!",
"However, he knew that he could not hope to carry it out all by himself.",
"I think we need some extra color in this place.",
"She had heard that he knew how to speak, but that he was very difficult to understand.",
"As it was, he missed it.",
"The only fight of any moment had taken place within the camp.",
"It was the latest sign of life there.",
"He very soon found a new field in which to labor.",
"The election came.",
"It is no doubt the chief work of my life.",
"I never before was, so to speak, face to face with death.",
"At table I would not let him eat for speaking of it.",
"I will speak all.",
"Quite a new turn of ideas was given to me.",
"I very much doubt it, my friend.",
"She did not speak at once.",
"To raise him up and make a man of him.",
"He saw his advantage.",
"I do not know now who else was concerned in it.",
"They will not speak to me.",
"They are getting worse day by day, and I cannot catch him.",
"It was not easy for him to speak.",
"And she could think of nothing to say simply because those things that she would have said to others would carry no weight with this man.",
"I have not had time yet to realize what I am doing, all that is going to happen.",
"I allowed him to stay on here and carry out his plan.",
"It is behind the trees.",
"They all talked the way he did just now.",
"And never before had he been so ready to receive it.",
"So they talked of anything and everything.",
"As might be expected, he had come home from college with new ideas and new standards.",
"She had been waiting for a chance to speak.",
"And, as always, they talked.",
"We had every advantage, and what we wanted we took.",
"And here was the very chance they had all talked about.",
"That was a short generation ago.",
"I got her away to bed.",
"There could be no doubt it must kill her, and soon.",
"We put her to bed.",
"Yet that affected it little.",
"The time is come when I may as well speak.",
"He wants to be talked to, but he has got to be talked to right.",
"In a few days it is fit for use.",
"It will be fit for use the day it is made.",
"The breast.",
"They will be fit for use in a week.",
"Such is all the treatment that this disease in general requires.",
"The same kind of treatment is to be used as for the first class, only it must be more powerful.",
"Give, therefore, only just as much as is absolutely necessary to keep life in the body.",
"In almost all cases, when a fit is coming on, pain is felt on the left side.",
"When he bought a house, the first thing he did was to plant trees.",
"This, so far, it has absolutely failed to do.",
"He saw an advantage now.",
"Brother and sister had not talked so far into the night for a long time.",
"This thing is only fit for children.",
"At least that is my opinion.",
"What left the judge?",
"It was then quite dark, so the shot missed.",
"He was below me, at first, far in the distance.",
"I could see so much in the distance.",
"Get to bed!",
"Now who is it who writes thus?",
"At any rate, our experience has done much for us, and has helped us to avoid failure.",
"It is a war of ideas.",
"I can speak to this point, for I have lived there and seen it at work.",
"Around, how wide!",
"Are they my love and my brother?",
"And will I hear him speak?",
"This is true for different individuals as well as for one religious community as compared to another.",
"There seemed to be no doubt about this.",
"He turned away without speaking.",
"Then his voice fell again.",
"What was this simple child of nature driving at?",
"The question most likely to be asked concerned my character and the place from which I had come.",
"I never saw much of girls or children.",
"War with a powerful country!",
"Could it be only the power of a new labor organization?",
"Never had the distance between them seemed so great.",
"The hell was done with.",
"Her only brother had left his home to fight, and there was no telling if he would ever come back.",
"And like her brother he was going to kill and to be killed.",
"He knew, but he did not speak.",
"They would never catch him in the dark.",
"The advantage was all his.",
"He missed.",
"He had no doubt of his intelligence, his reason, his choice.",
"But the words would not flow.",
"They have taken advantage of the war situation.",
"Up again, like a cat, he began to fight.",
"For they, and the labor of them, had made him what he was.",
"But she could not speak a word just then, and it appeared that her father was in the same state.",
"Her heart seemed too big for her breast just then.",
"Then she looked directly at him and tried to speak.",
"Give my love to mother and the girls.",
"So it has not to do with distance.",
"Some one else can carry it on now.",
"After the war there may come trouble between labor an capital.",
"Yesterday we count as a day of events.",
"He talked for a full hour.",
"After dinner we made our first attempt.",
"She was of a very serious and religious turn of mind.",
"He is my brother, and I am the next in line.",
"I doubt if I would know him if we met face to face.",
"I could not even attempt their solution.",
"She will not speak or eat.",
"Indeed he gave me little time for doubt.",
"I thought she was going to speak again, but the words failed to come.",
"With that he demonstrated his idea.",
"The audience thought the animals would kill everybody.",
"From a distance they looked like one man now.",
"All girls do.",
"Tell the judge not to go.",
"But he did not speak.",
"She knew from his look, without asking.",
"But they were there, at no very great distance.",
"Seeing that he made no attempt to move, she started to come to him.",
"Sent me for the judge.",
"The company filed out of the front door and around to the back.",
"No doubt she was often put to it in the beginning to find food for them both.",
"Weather does not happen.",
"I am of opinion that very little, if any of it, was his.",
"Speak to that.",
"Go to bed, and it will soon be morning.",
"I catch myself at it quite often.",
"But the general effect was powerful.",
"The audience did not believe him.",
"His name was not even mentioned.",
"We want to get this election over without trouble.",
"The women are beginning to raise hell all over the country.",
"This year the advantage comes to us.",
"I talked too much just now.",
"Was it her part to speak for other women?",
"Absolutely none.",
"This house was built for some woman, no doubt.",
"Well, every man has that right, absolutely.",
"I am on my way home from driving the children to school.",
"He could not speak to them or see them.",
"Was he then taken for ever from his parents, and his brother, and sister?",
"What a happy cat she was!",
"It was weeks and weeks before I made friends with that cat.",
"As we went along, houses began to appear here and there, set back from the road among the trees.",
"Several children put up their hands, and he asked each one to speak in turn.",
"He always thinks it is behind him.",
"I took it into my head, for some reason or other, to count them.",
"We used to kill a cat nearly every night.",
"Which leads us to speak of another person.",
"He offered his hand.",
"That is all anybody could want!",
"Is a man in a fit?",
"He had not yet gone to bed.",
"I must go back a few steps, and make sure.",
"Of that I have no doubt.",
"The next steps were easy.",
"And I did want to camp just there above all places!",
"The camp must be on fire!",
"The other then examined it from one end to the other.",
"I only hope he has, though I doubt it.",
"Now walk this way only a short distance.",
"After I found the gun I brought it to camp and put it in the box again.",
"I doubt if, to begin with, it will be possible to provide for these cases.",
"Let me speak a word, too!",
"Care will kill a cat.",
"In summer, quite the other way, I have to go to bed by day.",
"When the cat is away, the mice will play.",
"If my name should be mentioned, keep still.",
"Poor kid, little he knew what he was going to go through.",
"Just as I did that, a key fell out.",
"All I know is what everyone in camp thinks.",
"Talk about good turns!",
"He was no longer able to contain himself.",
"Tough as ever?",
"Might he not stop there and be somewhere on the watch for her?",
"It is so long that it makes me feel old to speak of it.",
"I think his brother has not heard from him for some years.",
"Sometimes we do not speak for an hour.",
"How many could I count?",
"As fast as he could speak.",
"The girls think so much of it.",
"It makes girls think of their hands and their figures.",
"But girls do have sometimes.",
"It was in the newspaper.",
"I realize it more every day I live.",
"And they added a number of other things for the girls, too.",
"They simply said they knew the girls had gone home.",
"They must be somewhere about.",
"That is a deep question.",
"It is true, no doubt, in many other cases.",
"When they called to him he did not speak.",
"There was only one way to make even the attempt.",
"But he took advantage of it.",
"There was no doubt about it.",
"How could so rich and powerful a man be like others?",
"No doubt he does.",
"Did she imagine that he was one of those who can see only that which is in the distance?",
"Would it matter to her what success or failure meant to him?",
"Still, not everyone had gone to bed.",
"Does anybody know?",
"He offered to take me with him and help me on in my turn.",
"But the husband, no doubt, has ideas of his own.",
"It is enough to kill anybody.",
"I did wrong to speak as I did just now.",
"Neither the mother nor the father was willing to go to bed that night.",
"There is a bed in the next room.",
"She is a pretty little girl, no doubt.",
"No doubt, however, he knows very little.",
"How could he speak, how could he act?",
"There are plays and plays!",
"Is this the place where civil people be?",
"Why, can his dog speak?",
"Yet give me leave to speak.",
"I am content.",
"What means our brother?",
"Has no man heart to speak?",
"Whether she did or not is more than I or anybody else can say.",
"That night I had a long talk with my brother.",
"Not a doubt of it.",
"But the weather!",
"Every boy cut his name somewhere before we left last term.",
"The old thing may come to pieces.",
"I am beginning to think that a good many of them are more concerned with the success of their method than with the success of their cause.",
"Why is it that we have a labor question at all?",
"Well, how are they going to raise it?",
"They are going to raise it from the public in general, some of whom will buy their stock.",
"Can anybody bring them to account?",
"She knows without asking.",
"If anybody could make me hate it, she would.",
"I will carry it through now.",
"And perhaps she never knew all that she had missed.",
"He was not in bed all last night.",
"The night would be dark after its setting.",
"I saw it as we fell.",
"It is probably the opinion of others, however, as well.",
"He tried to cut steps before he died.",
"He never missed it.",
"It is that from which all date their time, and count upon what is left.",
"The steps went up.",
"But a stop must be put somewhere.",
"See how distance seems to set off respect!",
"No one ever thought of asking her to sit for her picture.",
"I cannot catch a feature of him.",
"Whether they would avoid the hell he had made them see?",
"This, though very different from the newspaper stories, is quite enough to direct attention to the subject.",
"After a lot of asking around I found the place.",
"I am sure, they are not great, and, I hope, they are not powerful.",
"In that sense, almost every man may, in his own opinion, be poor.",
"Fell, however, did not leave.",
"Men judge of what they do not see by that which they see.",
"There are many different kinds.",
"This he did not attempt to answer.",
"I talked of living in the country.",
"I mentioned one who was a very learned man.",
"That is a good basis of content.",
"These were the last words I ever heard him speak.",
"In this opinion I am not alone.",
"Anyway, he was of a later generation.",
"But I did not speak.",
"But never mind, girls.",
"To him I speak.",
"He died, apparently without pain, in peace and religious hope.",
"How a man could speak out then!",
"He, and not hell at all, is what I fear.",
"It is therefore a matter of feeling and opinion.",
"I count many as my friends.",
"Is not the attempt worth making?",
"It was still no doubt a bad choice.",
"If they do, they are not fit to be considered a nation.",
"I can but attempt.",
"But that does not affect my situation.",
"That is the only way in which public work can be done, and public opinion can be built.",
"I became very much interested in one of the girls of my class.",
"I should have thought that some one had come from the dead to speak to me.",
"It was to us both a season of deep feeling.",
"He soon began to speak on these points.",
"How wide is the field of labor!",
"At length one of the company asked my opinion.",
"He gave me some information of the religious state of things here.",
"His eyes were deep blue, his hair light.",
"He had been shot through the breast.",
"I know a bit about plays.",
"I offered her at once everything I could offer.",
"And what an audience!",
"He looked at her, and her eyes fell before his.",
"Go to bed and sleep well now.",
"My brother will go.",
"He offered good pay, and I got a few dollars on account.",
"He knows that he is not fit.",
"Short for brother.",
"Black and blue?",
"I think he was asking his way.",
"To whom did he speak?",
"I know every family mentioned.",
"Then we turn up the fell side there.",
"How great a distance parts us!",
"These were some of the set forms.",
"Then, a short distance from it, only a little lower than the first, was another light.",
"Now, as I look back upon the recent past, I see it from a distance, as a whole.",
"Then she, too, began speaking of what I should do.",
"Speak out.",
"As to my private reading, I can only speak of what I remember.",
"As to the fact, there could be no doubt.",
"To think that he should be the first man to speak of love to her!",
"I will be content to wait.",
"Most girls go to their mother.",
"I have seen them, at a distance, once or twice.",
"No doubt it was to tell her why he had not been able to meet her that morning, to ask her to meet him later in the day.",
"Look at me, speak to me.",
"They then told them that they were content to stay.",
"Rather carry it away!",
"She receive such a man?",
"They talked.",
"We should not carry the people with us in the first moment.",
"Some of them fell down.",
"They talked of what they were going to do.",
"But the bed!",
"There was no bed.",
"I began to speak.",
"I looked at the trees as I passed.",
"There must be a government somewhere, and it must be known.",
"This, however, was not their opinion.",
"I could read all their looks, however, although they did not raise their eyes.",
"He fell.",
"He offered me his turn.",
"His crime is his brother.",
"They talked together.",
"Various pieces of information came in in addition to these.",
"I began to speak to this effect.",
"He had only been able to take a few steps down the street.",
"On the left there are trees.",
"And he mentioned a name.",
"I respect the name, but I judge it.",
"I did not go to bed until I had written it out.",
"It was several feet deep.",
"She had only to rise.",
"It seemed a great distance.",
"If it be wide enough.",
"I am content with this.",
"I could only judge from the papers.",
"How would his wife receive him, and what could he say to her?",
"But it was not so when the man who fell in love was a boy.",
"He fell in love with her.",
"It is just the place in which to realize how good the world is.",
"He felt that he could speak to her, make love to her, as he might to another girl.",
"Anybody could see that.",
"They do not doubt the issue, though they face it.",
"At all events, it affected me.",
"They went to the mother, who was in bed with her child.",
"That they have their uses no one can doubt.",
"The name called out applied to him.",
"Then he fell to serious thinking.",
"Just now he felt no doubt of the result.",
"This way, kid.",
"Her face fell a bit.",
"When he found that I had not, he offered to go with me to see it.",
"I have given the account of my religious experience exactly as it seemed to me at the time, and as I now remember it.",
"Others can form their own opinion about it.",
"After which all seemed well as far as he and they were concerned.",
"There was no need of speaking further for she had gone.",
"Most ideas are.",
"What might he not do, or attempt to do?",
"The girl started again to speak.",
"Days had, no doubt, gone by.",
"Then she went back to the bit of paper, took it and held it against her breast before she again read.",
"They would not carry far.",
"He could keep no count of time.",
"Her eyes fell from his.",
"Carry him my message.",
"But he would not go without saving his face.",
"The man was driving the girl before him.",
"No bed.",
"I know parts of several of the plays.",
"He offered a comment now, perhaps, to change the subject.",
"When they talked, it was because they had something to say.",
"He took back to camp with him all he could carry.",
"He fell down here.",
"Even then, I mentioned the street leading into the one where I was due, not the street itself.",
"But it never affected me like this.",
"No doubt he had some good reason, though.",
"If we talked of this together all night, it could make no difference.",
"What expression is right and what is not, is simply a matter of opinion.",
"That is right and well for every one concerned.",
"Carry her off, indeed!",
"And, ever as they went, they talked.",
"Just look how deep it is!",
"He was obviously deep in thought.",
"Everyone turned around to see who was speaking, but could see no one.",
"He has to use all of my ideas.",
"However, it is lost as far as the rest of the world is concerned.",
"As far as he was concerned, the only important thing was for me to get a good education.",
"I told them that I had received their card.",
"Let us, however, understand what is meant by failure.",
"There is no doubt about that whatever.",
"I doubt it.",
"I doubt them.",
"He is up off the bed!",
"And they contain the answer.",
"Right or wrong, she was put to bed by it.",
"They did speak.",
"A mean advantage.",
"She therefore talked with him about himself.",
"And she never has been, so he thinks she must be dead.",
"Where had she gone, with whom had she talked, what had she told?",
"This time he did rise and walk about.",
"Would she be adult if she were let alone?",
"So many made extra work for me.",
"The war had been talked of for some time, but at last it came.",
"This was too much of an exposure and it killed him.",
"I did not realize how important were the words of this man.",
"He told me that he had never heard anything of our mother or brother.",
"So far he has asked nothing from us, but offers everything.",
"They seemed in doubt.",
"It was never shown but once to an audience of one.",
"Of course not one of our friends agreed with the judge.",
"The next moment his face fell.",
"The mother was the first to speak.",
"She would not ask her any more, nor speak of it.",
"I long, and live, to see this love demonstrated.",
"He had to go somewhere.",
"I must spend that year somewhere.",
"Well, try asking first.",
"I must have heard it somewhere.",
"She had no doubt of her ability to help him.",
"There is absolutely nothing in it.",
"To doubt was no longer possible.",
"Not a doubt of that.",
"I was driving down the road.",
"The girl came forward and offered her hand.",
"What perfect weather we are having.",
"Both children felt that something was wrong somewhere.",
"I am quite fit now.",
"Found out what is the matter with my brother.",
"Her hand fell to her side.",
"Of the few changes made, however, one may be specifically mentioned.",
"To hell with them!",
"To do something, however, was absolutely necessary.",
"He was trying to speak now.",
"She had heard some such thing, somewhere.",
"Her name was not on the card.",
"Should he speak to her?",
"And he did not speak.",
"It has never missed yet!",
"That was why I talked with him.",
"He said he expected a friend, who might turn up at any hour of the night, and he wanted to leave a card for him.",
"If he did, why has he never mentioned it to me?",
"One day I missed it.",
"I will now speak of another form.",
"He offered a very easy chance had I wanted his head.",
"He would learn all about it, no doubt, if he were patient.",
"Then they fell into position.",
"But the count?",
"No doubt it will be some day, but the time is not yet.",
"I tried to catch him by the hands.",
"Am I not a man and brother?",
"Then she began to speak.",
"He fell to thinking of his visit to his mother.",
"He went back to bed, but not to sleep.",
"He was really much concerned about the boy.",
"The judge looked up from his writing.",
"Then he fell to thinking again.",
"He felt that friends were somewhere near him.",
"It was but a few steps.",
"Then he offers to buy.",
"Want of trees.",
"We talked of the practice of the law.",
"We talked of the stage.",
"It was rather worse weather than any that we had yet.",
"The weather was still so bad that we could not travel.",
"The weather was worse than yesterday.",
"There are very large trees.",
"I know not when I missed before.",
"She would have been content with one bed, but, for a time, none could be had.",
"I have a high opinion of him.",
"It gives no blue color.",
"This is, however, only one of its functions, and perhaps not the most important.",
"Carry it home with great care, and let it stand over night.",
"This extra work they can do for only a short time.",
"It has also many other and complex functions.",
"Press deep and hard for a few minutes.",
"Hold them at some distance.",
"If the flow of blood does not stop, change the pressure until the right spot is found.",
"He looked at her, looked at the water, and looked at the bed.",
"Must I die so far from my country and my brother!",
"But the current of public opinion was too strong for him.",
"Let this man speak, and this man only.",
"He did not speak, and his father took a step toward the door significantly.",
"Plays were therefore no longer wanted.",
"Men talked for a time of nothing else.",
"I speak from experience.",
"But what trees!",
"Books we talked about, and education.",
"It seemed to me that we talked of everything but love on that particular morning.",
"He had read the information in a newspaper.",
"They talked of many things, but for all their talk, I do not know why, and perhaps he did not know why, he never told her who he was.",
"I asked the girls for something to eat.",
"He is affected by it.",
"She may doubt.",
"Do not the sex carry all their points with their men by the same methods?",
"I wish I could say more to his advantage than I can.",
"Her parents will not receive her.",
"Then speak it now.",
"It is not fit I should.",
"At last night fell.",
"But no one mentioned it.",
"He could not find the catch.",
"But before he had gone many steps he turned to see her again.",
"The characters in them are all real, though their true names are not always given.",
"But let us see what led to this attempt.",
"He then went to find his brother, who, of course, did not remember so much about her.",
"He seemed to live whole years in those few days that he talked with his mother.",
"She took a deep interest in all his details, and he was never at a loss for something to tell.",
"She seemed more content now.",
"She heard him speak to his friend.",
"Before the woman could speak again she was gone.",
"I will make him speak.",
"No doubt he must.",
"It was, no doubt.",
"How to her son did she affected stand?",
"So me thinks.",
"Why, rise up then quickly, and let us be gone.",
"Content me!",
"And it is clear that the measure requires it.",
"They talked of many things, including business.",
"He was not content until he was by her side and was able to hear her voice.",
"So I will go to hell.",
"Neither person was missed.",
"Hell, to a father, is to be without his children.",
"I am content to know things.",
"She was in bed several days.",
"She was sitting on the steps of the house.",
"The men fell back before me.",
"Poor kid.",
"Just a kid.",
"What was the girl driving at?",
"Nor did she speak.",
"Give him hell.",
"How he must like them girls.",
"This thing must be absolutely legal in every way.",
"Saving his life was one thing, but giving up information with a money value would be quite another.",
"Ask anybody!",
"Hell, yes.",
"Need anybody else?",
"Otherwise I might always have had a doubt I did right.",
"Girls did not act this way in books.",
"But a saving second thought held him where he was.",
"Her face fell.",
"Nor did he speak.",
"Some people, no doubt, would do so.",
"What an advantage it is to be men of the world!",
"But he was of a different opinion.",
"The game of cat and mouse was over.",
"I have all the names and have examined all the men.",
"But I will speak not of that.",
"Be content?",
"She talked little.",
"That is a pretty tough beginning.",
"But how are we to judge which it is?",
"Of the fact itself there was no doubt.",
"I fell in love with it the first time I saw it.",
"We are in doubt about them.",

"We looked round the room.",
"It was all to no purpose.",
"The eyes grew wild.",

"I shall know in good time.",
"For what purpose?",
"Then he looked up and caught my eye.",
"I had to give it up, but the fact itself was obvious enough.",
"There was no time to pick and choose.",
"At times, it may be, I shall feel the lack of company.",
"For a moment he watched it.",
"Someone stopped him finally.",
"Perhaps that helped to lose me his confidence.",
"He had reached the goal.",
"What shall it be?",
"I shall never hear its like again.",
"Or kill, kill as no man had ever killed, did he choose.",
"But these larger views were at length lost.",
"At last they reached the bottom.",
"We want truth.",
"What shall he write about?",
"What shall he say about him?",
"And letters, too.",
"How was it possible for me to get at the truth?",
"However the child herself was a success.",
"We shall be late.",
"But as a matter of fact the truth on this subject, as on most others, is always known in time.",
"Of course I shall.",
"I shall look forward to it.",
"He turned round.",
"And, listen.",
"This last was the worst of all.",
"After a start she kept it to herself.",
"And anyone but herself would have lost him many years ago, would very likely have given him up.",
"It must be stopped.",
"I shall go and ask him now.",
"She turned round.",
"Conditions at home grew worse.",
"Her class grew larger all the time.",

"The men stopped.",

"All the same we shall fight.",
"After a while they stopped.",
"The band plays.",
"He read much in those last years in science.",
"Then, at length, she was free to think of herself.",
"Easier said than done.",
"I think I must be going crazy.",
"Set herself down well.",
"What shall we do?",
"Shall I send for it?",
"I called to them to stop, but they took no notice.",
"There is a new player at second base.",
"Of course if the ball was going on we should be prepared to keep open all night if necessary.",
"But we shall see.",
"And the worst of it was that I saw no way out of it.",
"I watched his every movement.",
"We were now even, and we stopped right there.",

"He stopped again.",
"He must get out of hearing.",
"Seems as if association did make value.",
"No hand held out, no eye for him.",
"There was a general movement.",
"Yes, rich, and fair.",

"Not at all, we have examples of both daily.",
"Shall not?",
"What shall we do to night, I cannot sleep.",
"Stay, shall I let her go?",
"This shall not put me off.",
"He was a little too familiar with me.",
"Well, I find we shall not agree then.",
"Most excellent!",
"She did it on purpose.",
"Nor was that the worst of it.",
"They want to protect him.",
"And I shall always do so.",
"First, then, we tell stories because we love to tell them and because the children love to listen.",
"It would have served me right.",
"A child with half an eye can see that.",
"Science was too much for it.",
"There we shall find death or love, I know not which, but it will be a great finding.",
"Then he did a wild thing.",
"I saw his purpose well enough.",
"It was short range, so I made my charges small.",
"And that, I think, is the truth.",
"The worst trouble, as I soon saw, was to be the matter of food.",
"That day is a memory which will never pass from me.",
"He caught my eye.",
"After a while I forced myself to rise.",
"I cannot tell, for I have no very clear memory.",
"Listen, brother.",
"Listen to me!",
"She took no notice.",
"She was one of the children of that land familiar with his presence.",
"She made another step, then stopped again.",
"While she watched, another came in by the same door as that at which the woman who was her charge had come in.",
"He took no notice.",
"I will not say that I believed even what I tried to think.",
"But I would not increase her trouble by taking any notice.",
"I went myself to the other side of the wall, keeping close to it.",
"I went round to make sure.",
"There is no argument with men of this kind.",
"It was not, perhaps, beautiful in the highest sense of the word.",
"I soon found there was truth in what he said.",
"She started and fell back when she heard what he said, but did not take her eyes off me, following every movement I made.",
"When shall we back from this service be led?",
"How shall our parents their requirements get?",
"How in our absence shall their wants be met?",
"Shall I begin?",
"But she held to her purpose.",
"Of course we must have a look round first.",
"But he believed that I could.",
"To those people I represent law and order.",
"Then I shall sit back and watch results.",

"What books shall I read?",
"The system is excellent, so far as it goes.",
"The argument is simple enough.",

"Dress on me.",
"Nothing easier.",
"I shall be able to travel in a few weeks.",
"The ball had ended.",

"I shall not.",
"What was she hearing?",
"I shall not be gone long.",
"She must have him now to herself.",
"I shall not be home for some days.",
"That would have revealed all she needed to know.",
"Wall, I think I can find him in another way.",
"It was the property of her father.",
"Now listen.",
"I may know the purpose and I may not.",
"I shall find them.",
"They seem to understand each other when they are at the worst.",
"Before she comes back, her brother will be in a place she can visit with safety.",
"But it shall all be made known.",
"Her responsibility is determined by her real power.",
"And, too, that is the way we shall all get close enough together to really see the truth about things.",
"I know well a couple who lived together long enough to have grown children.",
"After this, it was easier work.",
"The challenge was passed.",
"And then he forced out the words one by one.",
"I told them they were crazy.",
"A wild thought came to the other man.",
"My face will be covered.",
"What made the ball so fine?",
"But by whom and for what purpose?",
"Well, we shall have to find out what it was.",
"She stopped again.",
"Shall a woman not be loved?",
"She came for the letters!",
"What was he doing there against the wall?",
"Before that, he knew nothing about the letters.",
"Indeed, his position was unique.",
"There was no safety but to take the road early.",
"She would be giving up part of herself when she took these back.",
"Would her memory serve her?",
"She must know for herself and do the right thing.",
"She told herself that it was the only thing to do.",
"Nobody would know where to look but herself.",
"Watch them as they move round.",
"So long as I live, she never shall play a part in this work.",
"All the land was covered with trees.",
"This time the plants grew very well.",
"Then he went down the wall.",
"They wrote him letters.",
"He knew that wild animals do not like to face a fire.",
"The country was nearly all covered with water.",
"But the worst of the way was yet to pass.",
"And he was a great writer.",
"He knew so much about law, that I was sure he was a lawyer.",
"Much of our country was then covered with great trees.",
"It hit him in the eye.",
"On his way he went round to the college to see his brother.",
"Sometimes she stopped and looked around.",
"Then she would stand and listen.",
"But he watched her.",
"That was not the worst of it.",
"They show other people how to live in a wild country.",
"He knew all about the wild animals.",
"She tried to make herself look like a woman.",
"Then she went to see the place where the crazy people were kept.",
"Should one always tell the truth?",
"Listen to the talk of the average person.",
"These served us for food on the way.",
"In this round I continued during my stay there.",
"I think she meant he was wild.",
"He told her where to write, and added if she could find a way to get his letters he had much to say.",
"Where this led was obvious.",
"They saw the contract would not pay and let it go.",
"All the same, my risk is obvious.",
"The thing was obvious.",
"He stopped her.",
"I stopped.",
"It did not please me to feel that it was out of my keeping.",
"What followed this movement is a matter of general history.",
"If my friends love me, it is because I try to tell the truth.",
"The professional woman is going over the top, and with a good opinion of herself.",
"Is her hearing perfect?",
"Until that time we shall rest here, for we have done work enough for the present.",
"It went wild.",
"He watched the effect of this shot.",
"Now, my way it will be easier.",
"We had to come in on foot.",
"It was a small room, containing a double bed.",
"Some of the jury might think one thing and the rest of the jury might think another.",
"I thought of my letters that I wrote to him.",
"But were they her letters?",
"Of course he had received some letters.",
"The wall was free from end to end.",
"I shall never know.",
"I had but little time in which to choose.",
"He was trying to drive me into giving him my full confidence.",
"I can see it in her eye.",
"Yet who was there to notice him at this hour?",
"The truth?",
"The truth about what?",
"I may as well own the truth, and be done with it.",
"He was showing himself now at his very worst.",
"I believed so.",
"I had no purpose in what I did.",
"They have never liked him, and now they believe the very worst.",
"I stopped her.",
"Right or wrong, I stopped her.",
"It seemed to die a double death at these words.",
"For I believed him!",
"As he did this, my brother looked round.",
"I have every confidence in her.",
"I remember feeling all along the wall.",
"I wanted air, movement.",
"His answer revealed much of his mind.",
"He felt the eyes of the man upon him, and stopped.",
"The music stopped.",
"Each day he thought less and less of the wild places, and more of her.",
"Twice he heard movement.",
"It was not because of fear for herself.",
"Then the night grew still.",
"He watched his chance, and went out through the door.",
"Ahead of it came the wild things.",
"And it was in the law of the wild that they would have to fight to keep it.",
"This made work easier.",
"It was covered with blood and hair.",
"For if the life that now I lead continue, I shall die.",
"But no man goes there without his weapons.",
"They grew up.",
"He must be crazy!",
"The procedure was simple.",
"But this official figure must not be considered as being a long way from the truth.",
"I grew familiar.",
"Have my readers ever thought what is meant by growing?",
"What he thought about his trade and some other things we shall see by and by.",
"I shall soon explain what I mean.",
"What shall I put on it?",
"It was not until I grew older that I learned something of his history.",
"At last I looked up at him, big with purpose.",
"In truth, I had no reason to love the place, nor had any within it reason to love me.",
"I had nothing to say in answer, for in truth I believed he was looking too much on the dark side, and yet did not like to tell him so.",
"I shall die!",
"The truth had not been half told him.",
"It had stopped an hour ago.",
"From the bottom of a well, father.",
"How shall it be?",
"But it is far from the truth.",
"The way out is fairly clear and obvious.",
"The worst piece of road, however, was also the most important.",
"She is like a wild thing to be gone.",
"We shall soon have nothing more to eat.",
"They passed through the town, and then, just south of the town, they stopped.",
"But there was mind in his eye.",
"I shall go to her, but she shall not return to me.",
"Let this be so, they are still of interest on points of fact which it must have been easier to record than to imagine.",
"But all was to no purpose.",
"The theory was a weird one, but was it the truth?",
"It will be an interesting case when we get to the bottom of it all.",
"We shall not be heard upon the water.",
"She had changed her dress, and was all in black.",
"If she is there, we shall easily find her.",
"It is not always easy to judge them fairly.",
"I knew I was being watched, though I cannot tell how I knew it.",
"But I saw it all with only half an eye.",
"He knew too well that the answer was obvious.",
"The truth first, my son.",
"Someone shall pay me for it.",
"I have heard much of the good examples parents set their children.",
"And still my father watched him.",
"I fear I shall fall down in only one respect.",
"For, if they are, they shall not have it.",
"We never shall.",
"I shall, I think.",
"In a little time now we shall part, never, if I can help it, to meet again.",
"Shall we sit a while and talk, my son?",
"We shall either get across or we shall not.",
"My father watched without a word.",
"We shall find out which it is in a few minutes.",
"I am saying I have stopped.",
"I shall have everything.",
"My father stopped, and was looking at the table.",
"Soon I shall be going.",
"Look at the obvious questions that will be raised.",
"The action probably did not please the jury.",
"He was in excellent form, and the others played up to him.",
"He never used it for its primary purpose.",
"I have her letters.",
"But give me notice.",
"He stopped.",
"The car had stopped.",
"Everyone who passed stopped to read.",
"At any rate, it served, so what more need be said?",
"When shall I go?",
"I must write a few letters before this business comes on.",
"When he went out with her he had his new red dress on.",
"For we at least believe that we shall live again.",
"But in that future state, what we shall be like, we know not.",
"For that, and that alone, shall bring a man peace at the last.",
"In truth, he does not even love himself.",
"Let death do his worst.",
"And how does he try to bring them round to him?",
"So only shall we see what and where we are.",
"Remember this last truth.",
"I think that by seeing what it means there, we shall see more clearly what it means here.",
"Where shall I find friends?",
"So shall we have to do again and again before we die.",
"These are all points on which I shall here offer no personal opinion.",
"We do not know whether this number ever really served there.",
"We may ask, but we shall get no answer.",
"He, however, took no notice of her.",
"The lawyer wrote it down.",
"What do I care what becomes of my money, when I am gone?",
"He had covered his good eye with his hand.",
"I believed her.",
"Some day or other I shall be in a taking again.",
"The reason why I cannot write letters at home is that I am never alone.",
"But I shall not say anything to him about it.",
"He was in our eye.",
"But when we are fairly in, I hope she will come and try it.",
"Of this I shall have something to say in my next paper.",
"It would drive me crazy.",
"She stopped a minute, to look at my friend and me.",
"May not some of us take to doing more to prevent it?",
"But those are not the worst things.",
"At first he could not identify the sound, although it was a familiar sound.",
"But how shall we do it?",
"Again she stopped.",
"Yet she could not bring herself to walk down his street again.",
"The state of the country grew worse from day to day.",
"We are willing that they shall walk as far as they can go and come in a day.",
"The truth was soon told.",
"If only in a church or a field, they shall have it there.",
"What a new world it seems to open out to the writer!",
"This was all it was possible for her to do by herself.",
"And now that they could love her in person no longer, they love her memory.",
"Memory came.",
"I go on very well, and have no doubt but I shall always be able to hit upon some such kind of job to keep going on.",
"Of course, he had but little real respect for the truth.",
"Only I shall have to tell my wife.",
"She had grown up with it, and as it was beyond doubt, so was it outside discussion.",
"She stopped.",
"She turned round and looked into the fire.",
"She was now quite collected.",
"I took my degree on purpose.",
"But the news coming, thus too late, only served an evil purpose.",
"She told me so herself.",
"She took no notice of the question.",
"Listen to me.",
"Choose now.",
"I believed him then, but I do not now.",
"Whatever happens, we shall not leave the house.",
"If the worst comes, we make our last stand in this room.",
"At the door he stopped.",
"How shall I meet him?",
"And, in truth, they never had.",
"But he meant to be fair about it.",
"There were no letters on the back, and nobody could tell the title of the book.",
"In truth, they had.",
"When I was well grown, at last, I was sold and taken away, and I never saw her again.",
"We shall do very well.",
"Listen to me once more.",
"This may occur at once, or in the course of a little time.",
"Their confidence was gone.",
"Listen, then.",
"Just how much study it takes to make a lawyer I cannot say, but probably not more than this.",
"But our concern is not with what might have been, but with what was.",
"They had at last reached their goal.",
"But how could the mother have believed him when he told her that he had seen a figure which could not possibly be human.",
"Then I shall try to find a little house for us both, which will be our home.",
"Everything is growing wild.",
"I shall only put his room in order, and if he happens to get up, I can make his bed.",
"But shall I be let in?",
"At such and such an hour we shall begin.",
"After what has happened I certainly shall not again.",
"I grew up without the knowledge of any good thing.",
"A wonderful change met the eye.",
"Nothing stopped them.",
"The place was full of gas.",
"I then had to bring up support on foot.",
"I stopped his paper, and set up for myself.",
"Funny I did not notice it.",
"Then we all went again to the wall and looked over.",
"Every now and then we looked over the wall and each time saw the cat following us.",
"If she wants to choose this way, let her.",
"Still, these things did not give me much concern.",
"With a great effort I caught the top of the wall.",
"We shall break it if we can.",
"Before the war we took little notice of it.",
"But are they fair examples of the average treatment?",
"Then we should hear more of the truth.",
"Why am I asked what next shall see the light?",
"Nor time nor death shall part them ever more.",
"He shall fear, but love my voice!",
"The sound is forced, the notes are few!",
"Fit, foot.",
"The men themselves showed that I speak the truth in this.",
"Not even this, however, served their purpose.",
"She had tried to be true to herself and to him.",
"But there was one that was rather unique.",
"All went as I had calculated.",
"I was fairly at a loss.",
"I can say no more, and perhaps the less I say the less pain I shall give.",
"He had served her father.",
"He almost took it into his confidence as if it were human.",
"If she could only have been sure of herself!",
"She called before she showed herself.",
"They look wild, as if they had to go somewhere, but did not know where that was.",
"That is what I shall do.",
"And memory helped him.",
"How could his memory ever hold all that had come to him?",
"I had to listen and watch.",
"Them last sure got my eye.",
"He did not understand, though he was forced to believe.",
"If men want to work they shall have work at big pay.",
"The truth is that life is a fight.",
"I shall look over them again next week.",
"But is the region of truth limited?",
"It was much easier than I expected.",
"I never could get at anything of his religious views.",
"Her purpose, however, was fairly clear.",
"Nothing will change his purpose.",
"Indeed it might be with this purpose in view that he had gone outside.",
"What shall be done with the body?",
"All I ask is fair play.",
"He left no doubt as to his meaning, his purpose.",
"What shall I tell every one?",
"His whole argument was on the table.",
"And now shall we start?",
"She watched until he had gone.",
"Was the man crazy?",
"This time there was no door between them, nor even the memory of a door.",
"So he held back and watched.",
"She had found herself.",
"Or she was finding herself?",
"There was blood on her hands but she did not notice it now.",
"That was her first wild thought.",
"Many other letters of great interest have recently reached me.",
"We soon shall meet again.",
"I feel my body die away, I shall not see another day.",
"But listen.",
"That would not be fair.",
"Only we must do it fairly, and not be mean, or try to get in the way of anyone else.",
"The children never would have believed it had they read it in a book.",
"And now listen to her!",
"It was not fair!",
"But listen!",
"A man can sell or will away his property from his wife.",
"The women watched each other to see who would go to see her first.",
"The others stopped playing, too.",
"She was going to tell him that she would not need a place, for she was going away, but something stopped her.",
"It called to the world to listen.",
"The worst count against her was that she would not tell anything about herself.",
"All we can do is to take the first examples which come to hand.",
"Here are some examples.",
"He shall have his dog.",
"If she had said a word, I would have run in and helped the dog that was getting the worst of it.",
"He played ball by himself.",
"He was so crazy about ball play that he could never get enough of it.",
"I shall have to get a new one.",
"I thought I would go crazy.",
"If we had been going fast, great damage might have been done.",
"A human dog is the worst of all.",
"That makes a band.",
"Our wild animals around here are getting pretty well killed off, but there are lots in other places.",
"We have not seen him for some weeks, and to tell the truth, this trip is as much to see what has become of him, as to make a demand upon him for the money.",
"She lose herself in sleep now.",
"It has stopped now.",
"He stopped in the door right across the street.",
"It meant at first, no doubt, simply speech, argument, reason.",
"Yes, that is the truth.",
"And to that truth no man can add, and from it no man can take away.",
"But so it is always in science.",
"Think, then, or shall I think for my readers?",
"The future of science has become the future of the race.",
"Science has a future.",
"Shall he tell her?",
"We shall see how and why.",
"To him, we shall return later.",
"Then the story becomes different.",
"The other times they go to the wall.",
"But they do not concern us now.",
"He never appears to have asked himself what was behind the eye trouble.",
"The individual is unique.",
"And the worst of it is the game worked only too well.",
"A little wild, but with a good heart.",
"They stopped just in time.",
"Now, what shall we name it?",
"Although served about an hour late, the dinner was a great success.",
"Well, he made a fairly good job of it.",
"But is it the whole and complete truth?",
"A day after the fair.",
"He means that he has shown the world a more excellent way of love.",
"I shall now die with a mind at rest.",
"I think he would have gone crazy if I had told him no.",
"Either that or he was half crazy.",
"And then it stopped.",
"Shall I try it?",
"Some said he was crazy.",
"I shall see her no more.",
"We shall not attempt to follow the course of the game here.",
"We shall see.",
"There was one thing I believed when I was a very little girl, and it was not true.",
"That other day, I would not listen.",
"The case was forced on him.",
"The words did not concern him.",
"I believed in him.",
"Her letters were something of a trial to me.",
"And the letters I have in return!",
"Nobody helped her, she did it all herself.",
"I thought, perhaps, that was in confidence.",
"It is early in the morning, that is, early to be writing a letter, but I shall not have much dinner to get for myself and I want to write letters all day.",
"How can one person know how a truth may affect another?",
"Would he find her grown up when he came back next time?",
"She must go herself.",
"Some of the girls said that she did not care enough about dress.",
"What shall I say to his mother?",
"He believed that tonight.",
"Now listen to reason.",
"How could she help them to be what she was not herself?",
"As I shall never write a book, I must learn to talk, and talk myself all out.",
"In the other time she had always read his letters.",
"It was not like the letters of the other time.",
"For an hour they all believed her dead.",
"As a matter of fact he had not stopped in many times that distance.",
"Truth to tell, for the time being she was just as happy as he was.",
"I gave him all the letters.",
"The next morning was spent in writing letters.",
"They had been heard, but had not been believed.",
"It is not a book of natural science.",
"His purpose will stand.",
"He has made the round world so sure that it cannot be moved either by man or by worse than man.",
"His will and purpose, his care and rule over man, have not changed.",
"What then shall we think of these things?",
"And now, my friends, what shall we learn from this?",
"What shall we learn?",
"I should have believed of course in his place.",
"But do we listen to him?",
"But he will see fair play among his people themselves.",
"He is my father, and I his child, and he will protect me.",
"So much easier, my friends, is it to know what is right than to do what is right.",
"Their business increases.",
"Their credit increases.",
"His purpose has come to pass.",
"And so shall we.",
"He must make for that goal.",
"Once a thought stopped him completely.",
"He watched it in doubt.",
"He wrote the features down in his memory and kept them at hand for reference, as it were.",
"I just stopped in to see him.",
"But if we do say this, or anything like this, we say it on our own responsibility.",
"How can that be, we of these days shall say.",
"And we shall have a right so to speak.",
"I say, to choose.",
"What are men of science?",
"I know I was followed, watched.",
"Nobody took any notice of me.",
"Round and round and round they went.",
"All the animals were going to the fair.",
"It is simply necessary then for her to choose so no longer.",
"Like their mother, they were fair.",
"And note that this is a fair average place.",
"Having already been in service, however, she held herself fairly well.",
"I have brought the child here, and I certainly shall not take her back.",
"He who had watched over its work was dead, and it was dead like him.",
"But shall I ever have enough?",
"I shall have to go there.",
"There could be no understanding, because there was no confidence.",
"I am quite sure they have something of that effect on grown people.",
"And now as to the kind of story our professional is to tell.",
"And now, after the story is well selected, how long shall it be?",
"All that and more we forced him to do.",
"Why shall I doubt, did she not give it me?",
"But now what shall I do?",
"Shall nature win?",
"But shall I tell them so?",
"Shall I not?",
"What shall I do then?",
"What, shall we have a game?",
"What, shall we have it?",
"Shall I not have it?",
"Shall I agree first?",
"Shall this be done?",
"What shall I then do?",
"Nor now, nor then, nor where I shall be, know I.",
"He can and shall.",
"Shall he so?",
"But come, shall I begin?",
"Shall he indeed?",
"May she not have thought it easier to change him thus than ever to change herself back into being a woman?",
"Even then I could not realize that the worst had happened.",
"Too much room all round it.",
"There was really little for anybody else to do but to listen, and it was worth hearing.",
"That was the whole truth.",
"Those first letters home!",
"I must keep my eye on them.",
"The car turned over twice, but finally stopped right side up.",
"Nothing is further from the truth.",
"Shall we lose that also?",
"The distance calculated was covered.",
"Our goal had been reached.",
"We shall both be there.",
"She looked round.",
"And his eye fell on her left hand.",
"She kept this up for some days, but was at length forced to give way.",
"They stand round me and listen.",
"He had forced her hand and she did not know whether he had done it on purpose or not.",
"The truth will out.",
"Is the world all grown up?",
"He is not under the measure of property.",
"To say truth, it is time he were gone.",
"Such as I have, shall be given in their place.",
"They all appeared to be in full dress, and were really all beautiful.",
"They do not walk well, nor, in fact, do they ever appear to advantage when in movement.",
"We had a long list of homes to visit.",
"It will certainly be required, that notice should be taken of a book, however small, written on such a subject, by such an author.",
"His next argument is more clear.",
"Names are easily collected.",
"Truth may be in this well!",
"We shall now see what air will do.",
"How long I shall stay I have not determined.",
"I am but too certain they will now listen to no other.",
"I shall lose him, and he will take no leave of me.",
"Few readers have seen it, and it may please them.",
"The truth may not be told in a word.",
"As a matter of truth I did not expect to learn anything more.",
"But I could not listen.",
"I shall remain here.",
"Rather was it the daughter herself.",
"When something must be done, I seem never to know what it shall be.",
"That was the cold truth of it for one who knew women.",
"Here, read his letters.",
"Her plan was to win his confidence.",
"They could have found no more direct way to win his confidence.",
"All this set her thinking to some purpose.",
"Shall we go?",
"Crazy boy!",
"This is in effect what physical science has to tell us.",
"Even then the resulting knowledge is usually wrong.",
"What could I do but tell him the truth?",
"But how different the truth!",
"But, at the worst, the matter is not of life or death.",
"Speak them fair.",
"She herself had said that he would see her soon.",
"And I never shall have another!",
"He stopped and looked up, and tried to think.",
"But to what purpose?",
"If it will not work, of course there is no use keeping it a moment.",
"But there is yet another side to the movement.",
"They remain in it for the same purpose, and we help them to do so.",
"A common goal we have.",
"He has, we believe, bought property there.",
"There remains another argument to be examined.",
"I used to tell him that he did not stand for truth.",
"And the step is good for the individual lawyer who takes it and is good for the nation if all the lawyers take it.",
"They represent the right no less than I do.",
"He is quite right when he says that as a man of responsibility, a man having received a fair share of education, having had a fair share of experience of this world, I should know them.",
"He would not really have known my age, for he would not have believed me.",
"If the time should ever come when I shall know I should not believe, that will be another matter.",
"My age did not protect me at all.",
"This was in a wild part of the country, with not a house near.",
"He shall go for me, and I will send him.",
"But for what purpose are we here?",
"There was water at the bottom.",
"He grew older and learned his letters.",
"Father, listen!",
"Then he stopped short.",
"She, too, wanted something out of life, as I did, and there seemed nothing but that black wall always before us.",
"Every now and then he watched her.",
"I only want to see if there are any letters.",
"Well, he too was a writer.",
"He stopped at once.",
"That is the truth of it.",
"I watched his face change.",
"He made no movement.",
"She stopped him.",
"I shall be watched from now, day and night, if nothing worse happens.",
"Then they both turned to listen.",
"I shall ask him to help us.",
"Now listen to me.",
"I shall let him tell the story in his own words.",
"He had come to town on purpose.",
"And she said she could die easier thinking that what was good in her had passed to me, and not what was evil.",
"So he told the truth.",
"The expression upon his face revealed that, if nothing else.",
"I shall give myself up.",
"I shall have to get an order.",
"And I shall account.",
"That is the whole truth.",
"He looked down at the floor and at the wall at its side.",
"Well, well, so we shall know the truth at last, after all these years.",
"He watched all that was done.",
"Shall I suggest it?",
"The day was a challenge to one who loved the open.",
"She started to speak and stopped.",
"He was crazy!",
"In this I have some confidence of success.",
"I think my readers will not be sorry to have another of a similar character.",
"He all again shall win.",
"It is the positive by which a man shall live.",
"Truth is his life.",
"A man must be good to see truth.",
"They know in whom they have believed.",
"My only safety seemed to be in keeping next to the wall.",
"Then she stopped to say something.",
"My memory is clear.",
"Were there many such men in the world of which she knew so little, or was he one alone, and unique?",
"He stopped again, as if he himself were trying to understand it.",
"His face grew dark.",
"I shall know.",
"But she shall not have him!",
"I would rather know the worst, know what I have to face.",
"Was there any truth in it, was there any truth in it?",
"But I shall soon get well.",
"At the moment of leaving he turned round and let fall a few more words.",
"We shall see this later on.",
"To what purpose?",
"Round about here they will fight.",
"I turned round.",
"The truth was that they did not prevent us.",
"They looked round.",
"He was a lawyer.",
"We shall see them.",
"They watched each other.",
"He stopped me.",
"This revealed him.",
"It had stopped.",
"It was very cold, in truth.",
"There we were in safety.",
"Shall we try this?",
"The opportunity is unique.",
"An hour later I was in safety.",
"It was the truth.",
"Did they listen to him?",
"Is he a writer?",
"New, in truth!",
"What is this in truth?",
"In truth, that was the place!",
"Examples of the first class I am meeting with daily.",
"But we have said enough for our present purpose.",
"I shall now reason upon them.",
"By the mass!",
"His fire was not so much to keep off the cold as wild animals.",
"Here he stopped again.",
"But why had they come by land when travel by water was so much easier?",
"Morning came and went, came and went again, and she grew worse.",
"A huge argument.",
"That will I do, if truth may be of force.",
"When shall I find her?",
"Truth is, I neither can nor will.",
"This shall be told him.",
"I have lost my hearing, too.",
"They shall.",
"And which the worst?",
"I shall.",
"It shall be taken.",
"So shall mine.",
"Then one day I found myself outside the wall.",
"But we shall not live together again.",
"If one had no memory one could do many things.",
"He thought he had never seen so fair a place.",
"Think of his long letters once in a while.",
"Miles are covered.",
"The idea grew upon him.",
"But he was fair about it all.",
"They were simply wild.",
"We only want to get at the truth.",
"Here was an excellent example of it.",
"I believed every word the man said, and so did the jury.",
"The argument is good.",
"What must she do to win the confidence of the world?",
"No man is forced to face the problems of life alone.",
"I shall be paid something.",
"He felt he must act and that quickly, or else the worst might be his own.",
"So far nobody seemed to particularly notice them.",
"I am free to do as I choose.",
"He stopped the car.",
"Come, now, let me know the worst.",
"The car stopped.",
"We fight with such weapons as come to hand.",
"She needed sometimes to do things as herself.",
"The little girl was looking at us with round eyes.",
"Of this I shall here give but a single instance.",
"They had received notice of my coming, and were all waiting to receive me.",
"We shall get at the truth through him.",
"He said he was the city editor himself.",
"She stopped short.",
"And anyway they would soon find her and learn the truth.",
"Then he runs wild.",
"The days grew to a week.",
"She did not care to take part herself.",
"Every foot of the way he took advantage of such cover as was to be had.",
"And in the next thought she knew, too, that she could not kill herself either.",
"Her memory was good.",
"Notice one thing.",
"Yet I shall have to go.",
"The worst was, that I was far from sure it would help her.",
"She had no concern in that.",
"I shall live for that moment.",
"We women are true as truth itself to those we love.",
"I must prevent him from doing that.",
"How could I expect him to believe the real truth now?",
"I mean, there are so many different kinds of people, yet for the most part we all get along fairly well.",
"It may be weeks before I will be up to this challenge.",
"The audience may be large, but it will not listen to them.",
"He must believe what he says, or we shall not believe it.",
"We will listen to that.",
"But we should notice that he had an independent way of looking at things.",
"How very pretty is the perfect image of her in my memory.",
"If our readers, however, are of another opinion, they may look at it.",
"But who shall be raised in his place?",
"Shall he do this, or do that?",
"Sit down and listen.",
"I say, listen!",
"How shall a man answer that?",
"This right hand shall do it.",
"I shall say no more.",
"They stopped short.",
"For science has as yet done nothing but good.",
"Such is true science.",
"Why stop to ask whether she brought it on herself?",
"This I shall say, but little more than this, on the religious effect of the study of natural history.",
"They had all stopped.",
"But when all this had spent itself, what was she herself to do?",
"I feel just as grown up as they do.",
"Well it was that he stopped there.",
"It is not his to consider what he shall say, but only how it is to be said.",
"I know not what became of her, but I have always believed her dead many years ago.",
"The distance was not great, and we soon covered it.",
"For that matter, though, it was near the end of the ball.",
"She wanted to be by herself and think it over.",
"When close to the party he stopped, keeping his eye on the recent works.",
"He believed that they had brought him to this room to die.",
"So she took no notice.",
"We will take terms familiar to all.",
"She always seemed to be a whole, and did not need another half to complete herself.",
"Where shall I go?",
"He will wait for me, and I shall not come.",
"But she was soon herself again.",
"What shall I do about it?",
"And they can listen, too.",
"She herself lives in the little room above.",
"I am sure I shall find it.",
"It is one of the most beautiful, and is certainly the most unique structure in any city.",
"She of herself had no power.",
"What shall we do if she goes on like this?",
"There were to be no letters.",
"Indeed, he seemed to think of no one save the patient herself.",
"She is not at all like herself.",
"It is caused, I think, by a change in mother herself.",
"But we shall never catch it.",
"And again he stopped her.",
"The reference to it grew out of the proposed change of meeting.",
"She had told him the truth.",
"I shall wait here.",
"They were certainly very excellent.",
"Then we shall win.",
"I shall take her away.",
"I shall take her there.",
"Everything might be easier.",
"But I know it is the only way I shall ever be content.",
"A few words from the old lawyer and she began to feel more confidence, however.",
"He did not look at the jury as they went out.",
"There was but one issue for the jury to pass upon.",
"Who is he to challenge the future?",
"I shall enjoy being with her.",
"They represent his entire capital.",
"Shall we tell him?",
"Or shall we keep it all dark for a while?",
"We shall have to wait for news.",
"There he stopped.",
"And it was sent for one purpose only.",
"And I shall have to tell them why I came up.",
"All that shall be done immediately.",
"The great thing, of course, will be to get hold of the woman herself.",
"The mass of the people were only concerned with the general idea.",
"I shall have something further to say on this subject.",
"He showed that he believed it would be carried out.",
"I believed that it would not be.",
"In the views thus expressed I was not alone.",
"They have been of service to science.",
"For this purpose several are caught.",
"These people feel in their blood the call of the wild.",
"His men believed in him, and he had good reason to believe in them, for he had excellent stuff under him that day.",
"If we do not live up to the highest, how can we expect these poor workers to do so?",
"Together they covered all recent military history.",
"We shall be all the longer getting there.",
"But, listen.",
"We shall do all in our power to help those who are below.",
"I feel that we shall get to them this time and bring them out.",
"We shall have to work him in a different way now.",
"After that, there would be nothing to prevent his mother from taking him to her home, and that she would do so there was no longer any doubt.",
"They heard him and stopped.",
"He had not had full confidence in him from the beginning.",
"Perhaps the lawyer was still waiting for him.",
"I do not wonder that he should lose the power to move on hearing it.",
"But, as a matter of fact, the jury were doing no such thing.",
"We shall find that out.",
"But he came to it at last and stopped there.",
"Different views of the same subject at different times.",
"I speak as a lawyer.",
"It has a famous fair.",
"Least of all by herself.",
"I do not know what might be said if we stopped him.",
"He must have known what my views are.",
"She grew red and white by turns.",
"There are several examples of this in the human body.",
"It is found that a man can do more work without alcohol than with it.",
"The advantage of this is obvious.",
"The heart does not contract as a whole.",
"A central part of any body, or that about which matter is collected.",
"A cold may make it easier to take the disease.",
"Whether on the road by day, or in the night where they stopped?",
"We do not stand alone to choose.",
"The light grew upon her face.",
"It is a happy confidence.",
"If there is more of this music, I said, I think I shall stay.",
"I shall tell only what I like of what I remember.",
"He was supposed by most people, and almost by himself, to have gone crazy.",
"Shall I tell?",
"He grew to be like them.",
"After a while he stopped.",
"He had them all in his memory.",
"She is dead now herself, but many still living remember her.",
"That is the very worst there is.",
"Account of the letters he has come at.",
"And then I shall have it by heart.",
"But they cannot hold all the letters I should wish to see.",
"But to own the truth.",
"I mention it therefore in confidence.",
"The world will think the worst.",
"More to the same purpose he said.",
"To stand by, and see fair play between an old man and death?",
"Without hearing the whole of the letter?",
"I shall make great use of this letter.",
"How excellent this!",
"And what if she shows a great deal of concern?",
"At last she stopped looking away, and came across the floor to him.",
"She could not help herself.",
"But it is much worse to be seen and not believed in.",
"They had never learned that it is not fair to listen that way.",
"I shall find a way out.",
"He went round and round the wall, but there was no sign of a door.",
"For she knew very well he did not want the truth.",
"But morning after morning passed, and she seemed to take very little notice of him.",
"I know the other girls will be crazy about it.",
"She stopped, for she did not know what to say.",
"She was getting control of herself now.",
"Sometimes there is a little light round her head.",
"The bottom fell out of it the first night.",
"But what is this to the purpose?",
"It shall, it shall!",
"Shall we take his money?",
"I doubt not we shall have him in our power.",
"By the mass, I cannot tell.",
"But he shall hear me!",
"What shall we now do?",
"The matter shall be done.",
"Where shall I first begin?",
"I purpose now to try another game.",
"Still they that have enough shall meet with more.",
"I will not, and if I can choose.",
"When shall I come?",
"She believed he was speaking the truth, so far as he knew.",
"Let all the world come and listen if they want to.",
"She had an excellent heart.",
"I shall like it of all things.",
"How beautiful she had grown!",
"It was science.",
"All that night they watched by the dead.",
"And so we shall be married when we get there.",
"I shall never be my own again.",
"Right or wrong this is our purpose.",
"Many a fair charge did he lead that day.",
"It had served him well in the past.",
"But I wanna be fair.",
"Nothing ever has stopped me.",
"The worst, of course.",
"He did hear me, and he watched me go.",
"There he stopped and looked in.",
"He knew it just as sure as he was a foot high.",
"I had a fair idea before, but now I know.",
"So far he seemed to be telling the truth.",
"In very truth he had something to tell her but he had not meant to tell her so soon.",
"But they had stopped.",
"At last he got to the bottom.",
"It will not be the last time by many a one that we shall have to make believe.",
"I know what I shall do.",
"And there he stopped.",
"And there he stopped, and just in time.",
"Lots of them, all obvious and simple.",
"He told the truth.",
"Unless it does this at once I shall not go back here.",
"I shall pick them all up.",
"We go to a ball.",
"We shall do all the actual work.",
"And I believed him.",
"I wonder if we shall see anything of the experiments, when we get there.",
"These are foreign to my purpose.",
"Nothing shall remain of them.",
"Who would listen to him?",
"To this church a name which is general property has been given.",
"They are located near the wall.",
"The feet should be well covered.",
"As little dress during sleep as possible.",
"Keeping them out of the way.",
"But the reason is obvious.",
"On this point I shall speak at length, in another part of this work.",
"Form of the dress.",
"Material of dress.",
"There are obvious reasons why it should be so.",
"These I shall consider in their order.",
"But in truth he was at peace.",
"Her dress was ready, however.",
"I watched the test.",
"They created legal science.",
"Like them, he had a wonderful memory.",
"He believed it all.",
"Indeed, no such standard can ever be forced.",
"The forces of evil are hard to control now as they always have been.",
"But if we lose them we shall learn the reasons by hard experience.",
"We are all familiar with the result.",
"He is an excellent man.",
"And the reason of it is obvious to every one.",
"And my first argument is thus.",
"What then shall we do with them?",
"How shall we be ever able to pay them?",
"For this reason I sent for him once every month, and after keeping him with me a few days, I sent him back.",
"Letters, I hope, pass through.",
"I always believed in life rather than in books.",
"Or take a simple and familiar example.",
"Yet I hope that the matter is going on fairly.",
"It does not occur to him, that he also might be as happy as a boy, if he lived more like one.",
"What shall she do?",
"What covered all?",
"Listen to us!",
"And yet I shall have to do something.",
"He would have his own way, and no one could prevent him.",
"No man of science or letters has such access to men.",
"His life is daily argument.",
"Shall we walk down the street together?",
"And the reason is obvious.",
"How early this property was found, or how, we do not know.",
"She kept his records and notes and wrote his letters.",
"If willing to be led, they shall not want a kind hand to lead them.",
"But there were other interests to be considered.",
"As it was in the beginning, so it shall be ever after.",
"The boy turned his face toward the wall.",
"Just listen at that!",
"But to the argument.",
"There was nothing to do but go through or lose many miles in going round.",
"After looking at them for a time he asked where those views were taken.",
"Where shall I be then?",
"The story comes home to me like truth.",
"There we should have stopped.",
"But we shall let them speak for themselves.",
"And life once over, who shall tell the rest?",
"How shall I speak?",
"The mass was over.",
"She had been left to herself as long as she could remember any thing.",
"She never asked herself if it was wrong or right to love him.",
"Where shall we go?",
"It is a round game!",
"He wants keeping in order.",
"He is fairly off.",
"I shall be black and blue.",
"He grew cold as he thought of it.",
"She has stopped for this purpose.",
"He could not have believed it.",
"I shall find funds to meet these wants.",
"Even at that moment she could not bring herself to look him in the face.",
"Now we shall never part.",
"The name shall live.",
"We shall hear no more of it, believe me.",
"His face grew black as night.",
"She forced herself to read over the letter again.",
"She believed in him, why did he not believe in her?",
"He had never seen such a look upon her face all the years he had served her.",
"The child put herself in my hands.",
"He covered his face with his hands.",
"I never saw a man so wild.",
"But even this failed to break up his crazy plan.",
"So we stopped there and had a good visit.",
"His name I shall not mention.",
"Letters, letters, letters, letters!",
"Its internal administration was provided for with equal care.",
"Or shall we?",
"As much as they choose to buy.",
"There shall be no judge.",
"The writer of these lines, is the author of that book.",
"They are unique.",
"It is a fair case throughout.",
"But he could make it one, yet, by going forward on foot.",
"The bill had caught his eye, and he was reading it.",
"He did not care for it, and had therefore no eye for it.",
"Shall I not claim my own?",
"What more shall I say about them?",
"I did not know what to think of all this, and like every one who does not know what to think I thought a great deal, and to little purpose.",
"This, too, is obvious.",
"She seemed to be taking no notice of him and to be talking to herself.",
"She had lost him, and she felt that, if she had been left to herself, she would have kept him.",
"First of all there is the contract.",
"I shall never set eyes on anybody like her.",
"All come round, indeed!",
"That is true, just as much as every half truth is true, but the other half is also true.",
"He usually went round to the front door.",
"She would not be believed, and no good would be done.",
"It was not with them as with a man known to the writer of this history.",
"Nothing will be easier.",
"They think I am crazy.",
"It is a state of mind familiar to me.",
"They have no concern at all for me.",
"It is the truth.",
"But that was not the worst of it.",
"It is easier to than not to.",
"I went wild, too.",
"Maybe this is the end of it, and I shall have called them for nothing.",
"Of course he was crazy.",
"Also, I shall be living on air.",
"The worst of it was that there was nobody to help me out.",
"We wanted to know why we were stopped.",
"But they are not unique in this.",
"Nor would he listen to reason.",
"To save themselves, the newspapers could not tell the truth about her.",
"Most happy letters!",
"No, for this purpose I came to this hour.",
"And she served them.",
"Yet which I shall choose I do not know.",
"He added that he had great news, and had come on purpose to bring it.",
"But they would not listen.",
"Listen to them!",
"And his memory is perfect.",
"Never shall I sell it.",
"Man does not make truth.",
"She could not give herself away.",
"The world is round.",
"It was not fair to them.",
"The worst is right now.",
"A judge and jury are all that is needed.",
"It is familiar knowledge among all classes and conditions of men.",
"These things should be looked at all round.",
"What was really meant we shall see in a moment.",
"I shall stay where I am.",
"It is certain that at the end of a month I shall speak nothing else.",
"The man on foot made no movement in answer to the challenge.",
"But listen first to me.",
"His words were only for herself.",
"He appears to have gone crazy.",
"Shall I ever learn to do anything well?",
"I shall try to be of use to him.",
"And I shall try to do so.",
"I cannot work, nor even write letters.",
"Shall write again.",
"I shall walk over for the note if I am not yet home.",
"The last weight on me has been trying to keep notes for this purpose.",
"What shall I find over there?",
"Give me news of all who concern me, near or far, or big or little.",
"There shall be no more books of travel for me.",
"He shall be sent off next week.",
"But there is a fine movement and feeling in the rest.",
"To say truth, I have been here a little over long.",
"So stand I shall, unless things are changed.",
"If I get it, which I shall not, I should be independent at once.",
"Now I feel in a fair way to get round soon.",
"She would add a word herself, but she is too played out.",
"Shall I?",
"Shall I ever have money enough to write a play?",
"As it was in the beginning, is now, and shall be ever, world without end.",
"The next will come easier, and possibly be more popular.",
"The hear is excellent.",
"Well, we shall fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.",
"This is a great truth, and has to be learned in the fire.",
"I believe the notice will be interesting and useful.",
"I state these in no order, but as they occur to me.",
"And so I believe I shall.",
"I have no memory.",
"But I believe the very fact that it was only speech served the book with the public.",
"This does fairly well.",
"These are words of truth.",
"More when the mail shall come.",
"I shall find a way to have it come by next, or know the reason why.",
"I shall go.",
"Hearing, audience.",
"A fair.",
"Has he his eye upon them?",
"This, then, is what I would say to any girl who had confidence enough in me to believe what I told her, or to do what I asked her.",
"Her foot was down and her back was up!",
"I stopped to watch them.",
"The man caught the woman at the bottom of the steps.",
"I believed this, and I tried to do it.",
"He had no property at home at all.",
"She stopped and then went on.",
"This is the argument which I often, almost always, hear.",
"Will that make it easier for anybody else?",
"They have no special dress.",
"This is an excellent plan."],

["All eyes were turned in that direction.",
"I shall never forget a particular one at which I was present.",
"Then I opened my eyes, with a start.",
"Somehow, I think death is not very far away.",
"I was very much surprised, as she never came to see me.",
"Their style is so finished and sure.",
"I remember quite well his telling of an interesting conversation with him.",
"Each soul is at true and happy work.",
"The race is ever in old clothes.",
"Looking back over their years, they can only say, I have had clothes!",
"In reality, we are all workers.",
"We must therefore be very secret in our plans.",
"In this exercise I had no equal.",
"The words fell like ice upon my heart.",
"That is the only direction I need give for the present.",
"The doctor did not return.",
"My clothes are too good.",
"Even the doctor was there.",
"We finished just in time.",
"He turned over a few more pages.",
"No, there was no use telling the doctor.",
"My business was with the heavy top cover.",
"Once the experiment took a serious turn.",
"It was closed.",
"I did not see him again, the doctor.",
"Necessarily it must be a matter of theory, but I think we have it right.",
"I made up my mind to try one more experiment.",
"Is this forward movement finished?",
"Beat all well together.",
"Put on the ice and serve very cold.",
"Beat well.",
"Season to taste and serve very hot.",
"The experiment is worth trying.",
"We think he is all right on that score.",
"I forget which one.",
"Loss fully covered by insurance.",
"Many who work their brain are not up to much exercise.",
"He ran away in the course of the night, and I never saw him again.",
"Who put it into his head to want to go and see this animal?",
"She thought as she came forward to meet him that he seemed entirely different from last night.",
"They worry me.",
"He took himself and everyone else seriously.",
"The secret was simple.",
"He opened the box.",
"All that part is quite finished.",
"Somehow they had to find ways of getting more money.",
"He looked very sad.",
"He was not hurt.",
"Some were sad.",
"At last this work was finished.",
"She took them and ran off with them.",
"Here she opened a school.",
"Then he felt, good man, in need of exercise.",
"Come on, forget it.",
"Long enough it took she should grow up.",
"It closed around and around her.",
"I ran out of the house from it.",
"The fact was that for the time being his attention was turned in another direction.",
"As it was, he did not score.",
"That night the missing man did not return, nor was anything heard of him.",
"And so, after a fashion, it did.",
"Before we had finished the season several newspaper critics, I have been told, went crazy in trying to follow the plot.",
"I will drop them.",
"These will necessarily speak for themselves.",
"I fully expected something of this kind.",
"It is an entirely new, original, and complete article, which no family should be without.",
"What do they care about our church concerns?",
"Next day ice hard.",
"But he opened his eyes again.",
"They forget kill me.",
"He run down to be first on the ice.",
"Another woman came up and asked him to dance.",
"Never saw a soul.",
"Nobody was safe.",
"Had he not said himself that he had come up here to forget?",
"Got a taste for travel, too.",
"It, and half a score.",
"I have added this stage direction.",
"This is an obvious error.",
"It was the heat, no doubt.",
"He has a taste for women.",
"Somehow, it did not occur to him to doubt what she had told him.",
"The doctor went on talking.",
"He seemed to grow smaller.",
"Out of this comes the discussion of clothes.",
"And so, to a great extent, it did.",
"His active career seemed to have closed at last.",
"He had no taste for party politics.",
"He opened his eyes very wide.",
"Clearly she had written it in a white heat of feeling.",
"Then I announced my plan.",
"But without his clothes he is in a far worse case.",
"I never thought that I could miss, for if I had had any doubt I should have failed.",
"But now he had turned in their direction.",
"The door opened, and she felt herself free to come out.",
"Was it all closed?",
"The doctor did not share this last opinion.",
"It was a little experiment, too.",
"But the doctor took the matter more seriously.",
"And then he turned over the pages and showed her where the story was.",
"The heart of the woman was heavy in her breast.",
"He looked at me as if he were thinking in his mind how to hurt me most.",
"In the mean time the music and the dance went on.",
"It is the fashion of the times.",
"It was in reality very late.",
"In the morning my father was entirely himself again.",
"If the gift were a live animal, he would be sure to keep it and care for it.",
"Who can be surprised at it?",
"What was the heavy thing in it?",
"It came to me, somehow, in my sleep.",
"They carried out that office, the course of which they had originally prepared.",
"But his reform fell on evil days.",
"But the event was too important to miss.",
"He opened his eyes and put up one hand.",
"He ran out.",
"I may want to dance during the night.",
"The coast was clear.",
"There was no opening where he could get speech with those inside.",
"His own words were final on that score.",
"I got home safe.",
"It all depends upon the picture.",
"What was it that he saw as he turned the pages?",
"What is there to worry about?",
"Never while they lived would they forget that scene.",
"He closed the door in her face, and she heard his heavy step go back across the room.",
"The door opened.",
"I followed and closed the door.",
"That would seem to indicate that we are on the right track.",
"The face seems to me somehow familiar, but I cannot place it.",
"He even beat me!",
"So I left the house, he himself opening the door for me.",
"And the idea of opening it only by a certain combination is most happy and original.",
"At first the way was entirely familiar to her.",
"I know in reason hit never hurt her.",
"I was up there and showed him where the things grow.",
"The hurt looked old.",
"If she could do that, they were fairly safe.",
"That made him think that a black thing would take in heat more quickly than a white one.",
"When the father looked at them, he was surprised.",
"This picture was not finished.",
"Here he was safe for a while.",
"But at last he beat them.",
"But he had kept his secret long enough.",
"They were soon safe on the other side.",
"They felt safe.",
"They were soon safe from the fire.",
"This was a round piece of glass.",
"He opened one of them and went in.",
"Perhaps they thought it was a living animal that would eat them up.",
"It told them that the track had been found.",
"When his school closed, he went home.",
"He was now sure that he was on the right track.",
"He went the first time as a doctor.",
"But the ice let her down again.",
"The ice never let go of her.",
"But she was so fast in the ice that she never could get away.",
"Sometimes they were on the ice.",
"They were now safe among friends.",
"Then he ran as fast as he could.",
"But not necessarily.",
"Beat it.",
"To what extent shall the church concern itself with social and economic problems?",
"Study the following words in pairs.",
"Experiment, trial, test.",
"This exercise concerns itself with common words that have more than one meaning.",
"As largely as possible, take them from actual experience.",
"Many are not entirely new.",
"There appeared before me a little opening of the land.",
"After this he tried no more, and said he would not have me as a gift.",
"The light could be seen for some distance up the track.",
"Somebody helped the police and got hurt.",
"Well, I have finished.",
"Somehow the thing was done.",
"His heart beat when he went below.",
"No doubt, she needed money, but he knew she was willing to hurt him and could do so.",
"He did not seem surprised to see the girl.",
"Did she guess the hurt he had done her?",
"I closed it now.",
"I closed my eyes again, and tried to sleep.",
"Who would care to taste it?",
"They have kept the papers secret.",
"Was the doctor sent for?",
"I had only about half the amount in bank, and therefore could not meet it.",
"I closed my eyes, and opened them again.",
"How it surprised me to find them so near the ground!",
"They have opened up every line of service.",
"The effort is entirely civil.",
"However, to a certain extent we have been successful.",
"We shall be safe here.",
"Then, he knew, he was safe.",
"The other one is missing.",
"It was therefore the presence of his wife which had surprised him.",
"We are on the right track at last, my boy.",
"The door was closed.",
"What were these secret papers?",
"He was not long in getting on the track of that.",
"I believe the secret would be safe with him.",
"I saw the door of another room near me, and I opened it and went in quickly.",
"I could not forget that look.",
"The door was opened to him, this time.",
"Break the glass and look in.",
"He was surprised to find himself almost in the open country.",
"I want to forget that dinner.",
"I want him to remember me as I stand here before him with this glass in my hand.",
"What do I know about my old clothes?",
"She could not seem to take in what the doctor told her.",
"The night that followed was a heavy one for me.",
"She, herself, need have no worry.",
"The money I have may not be quite safe in my hands.",
"When he heard me, he opened the door and let me in.",
"It put me in the worst of positions.",
"She, too, was ready to beat him.",
"Her eyes were closed.",
"Her eyes opened.",
"His blood ran like fire.",
"He was hurt.",
"I might forget.",
"A moment later the door opened.",
"He was half again as heavy.",
"It was his first taste of blood.",
"One eye was almost closed.",
"Every face turned in the direction of the voice.",
"And whatever it was that came to her came from out of the south and east.",
"He could not miss her.",
"No bank so strong as to hold him in check.",
"No one was missing.",
"And while I live, I never shall forget.",
"My heart is sad.",
"Playing with all his might and all his soul.",
"My lot is sad and I am full of fear.",
"He went in that direction.",
"The people surprised them together.",
"The people took him away and sold him to a man who conducted him to his house.",
"That is the man who has taken a pretty wife and does not grow old.",
"My story is finished.",
"Our man began to dance.",
"He took it to his house and opened it.",
"She was not even surprised.",
"Recent events, however, have entirely changed the situation.",
"It is true that the price will be heavy.",
"One may even say it has not been seriously examined.",
"I believe that in reality it was larger.",
"How can the public have an idea of the reality?",
"Dark as was the air outside, he was surprised to find how dark the room was.",
"Nor let any one think this was other than a great step in the direction of reading.",
"One day at dinner the following conversation took place between them.",
"But all at once she opened her eyes wide, and made a sign to him to come to her.",
"He got down and ran to find her.",
"Night was at hand before we finished.",
"But my eyes were not opened until too late.",
"But I shall forget no longer.",
"She did not fear that his door would be closed against her, for he had no door.",
"It was decided to double the track.",
"They also had a heavy gun outside the town.",
"For we all read newspapers, and we all forget them!",
"In the next place, there were no clothes.",
"The hand points in another direction.",
"All this however depends upon an event which may or may not happen.",
"He was too great to do violence to his nature, which was not great enough to be really consistent.",
"He opened his eyes very quickly then.",
"The doctor says she will die if she remains here.",
"He held some secret knowledge.",
"What straight and decided line of action should I take?",
"He believed that she had revealed to me her secret.",
"It was a plot.",
"The secret she knows has never been revealed.",
"We were surprised at the great number of people who were seen there.",
"And its success will grow.",
"It was dark when we finished.",
"But I forget myself.",
"As he often put it, he had no time to care for clothes.",
"In which direction?",
"It is business now, and they cannot be combined.",
"I do forget.",
"Let us forget it, father.",
"We will leave her name out of the conversation.",
"She went for a walk in the direction of his house almost at once.",
"But that day of events had not finished for him yet.",
"Only half a glass, please.",
"They worry me, they do.",
"In a box of old clothes at that.",
"The door closed behind him.",
"But, somehow, it was not needed.",
"Of course, he took her quite seriously.",
"Look at me and my bank account.",
"All this land originally was the property not of any one family or individual, but of the community.",
"Most of his friends followed the sad example.",
"But be that as it may, it concerns us, I think, very little.",
"I cannot decide which is right.",
"His soul shall not die of its disease.",
"It was not too sad for the time in which it was written.",
"While they are making interest with others to help them, they forget to help themselves.",
"Plot not.",
"And that is just what too often the children of light forget.",
"Then she opened her book and began to work.",
"There was little time for the men to consider their actions.",
"She half closed the door.",
"She closed the door entirely, and was gone several minutes.",
"But the world is full of these sad cases.",
"That would worry them.",
"Am I the life and soul of every company I come into?",
"Air and exercise may do great things.",
"Will they, have they, did they come safe?",
"Were they to do again, I would reform them.",
"But perhaps the doctor might be able to do him some good, by the way he would be ready when times mind.",
"At last, he decided he had to do it with his eyes closed.",
"But not to worry, my little friend.",
"Yet there was something missing in his life.",
"So she passed his house with her head held high and her eyes straight ahead.",
"But how sad.",
"Sad that he had not done more.",
"I remember how my heart beat.",
"I thought I knew something of its power and reality, but I see I did not know much.",
"In which direction should she turn her steps with most advantage?",
"This gift she turned to good account.",
"I could never forget her.",
"In his last rest my soul shall love him.",
"I opened it.",
"Be still, sad heart!",
"Education does not grow like that.",
"At dinner the conversation was necessarily general, and, as such, is not worth reporting.",
"Should she try the extent of her power over him?",
"I have finished here.",
"She did not look toward him, but straight in front of her.",
"I always forget which.",
"We have to keep it a secret even from the people themselves.",
"He passed in front of her and opened the door.",
"She did not allow him to forget it either.",
"He opened the door.",
"She had to decide quickly.",
"The door had been opened from the inside.",
"But he was making heavy weather of it.",
"To wonder was to decide.",
"He wanted some help just now, and here might be an opening.",
"They seemed to be entirely at home.",
"He did not speak much of the difference between the people of one country and those of another, which rather surprised me.",
"What they need is the reality.",
"People began to drop in.",
"And she would have her tell her brother all their conversation when she had the opportunity.",
"We may beat yet.",
"Again, we should notice that development in one direction may be at the cost of development in another.",
"When it was sent home a volume was missing.",
"They all started and finished the whole song in peace.",
"I finished the song.",
"After saying this he ran away.",
"Who is his doctor?",
"I am allowed because I am the doctor.",
"How is she getting along, doctor?",
"The next moment the door was closed again.",
"Full of confidence she announced that they would return the next day with everything necessary.",
"Who opened the door?",
"Not a soul could be seen upon the street.",
"Each nation must decide for itself how it will meet it.",
"The lines had gone on ahead, so we were quite safe.",
"Blood ran into my eyes.",
"Small chance for me now in that direction.",
"So I made up my mind to go straight on before me.",
"The world is entirely changed.",
"There was never any secret about this, it was quite well known to many people who took no special interest in foreign politics.",
"Our literature is almost as rich as our language.",
"These people, he thinks, are all in a plot against him.",
"Happy my studies, when by these approved!",
"Rise, my soul!",
"Then he turned and looked straight into her face.",
"Even this threat failed to move him.",
"His soul was free.",
"Fact is they ran me pretty hard.",
"I forget his name.",
"Her heart beat high.",
"But men are all over, and these men work in secret.",
"A need of his heart and his soul!",
"His great fight was with his own soul.",
"Only thus could he forget her.",
"He did not forget the risk.",
"It opened up a new point of view.",
"It hurt her.",
"She released his hands and turned away.",
"Only his face is so sad.",
"All his whole soul must be set in one direction.",
"She must forget herself.",
"It hurt.",
"Tell them not to worry.",
"I seem to be alone with my own soul.",
"I cannot forget what I am here for.",
"I cannot forget that I am training to kill men.",
"Never do I forget that soon I will face death.",
"I am concerned with my soul.",
"Neither has any soul.",
"Perhaps the man who lives through the war will feel the change in his soul if he cannot tell it.",
"It wants to forget.",
"I am only an animal then.",
"Tell mother and dad, but not the girls.",
"Tell dad I made good.",
"No heat!",
"She looked sad.",
"It is very sad.",
"I ran him through.",
"It seemed to change and grow in volume, in meaning.",
"They are almost never opened.",
"I was most surprised at his fear of these men.",
"He put it to us straight.",
"I must not forget that.",
"Wait until I learn what secret is below.",
"Now let her drop!",
"Everything depends on that deal.",
"But only once more to grow as still as the big trees about him.",
"Another dance.",
"Right bad hurt, they said.",
"I am nearly dead with worry.",
"She must do her own thinking, come to her own decisions.",
"His secret is no longer his secret.",
"She ran by him then.",
"He loved after the only fashion possible to him, with his whole heart and soul, with his whole being.",
"She opened her eyes.",
"Now only she opened her eyes.",
"He ran his hand across his eyes again and again.",
"She thought that he had finished.",
"And still he had not finished.",
"Never forget that.",
"They would see where we had been here, but they would have to decide in the end that we had gone, both of us.",
"But not yet did she fully understand and not yet did she fear.",
"That somehow is for me to figure out.",
"Beat and missed and almost fell forward.",
"But it did beat.",
"It was like ice.",
"It must be very heavy.",
"After that they went to the big animal show.",
"That is when it is cold enough to make ice.",
"This is a secret.",
"No matter how much some people will miss it.",
"It seemed years to the doctor since he had seen them.",
"I have the right to decide, anyway.",
"She is the sort of woman who would show off good clothes too.",
"The doctor considered.",
"Forget it, boy, and get back to normal.",
"It will hurt, but not for long.",
"Soul to its place on high!",
"Of course, they will again set out on the same track, as being that which will most quickly bring them where food and water are to be found.",
"My soul is free.",
"They were not content only with killing.",
"But she did not seem to find me heavy.",
"That helped me, and I ran quickly and got it.",
"They ran up to him, but he was quite dead.",
"But she told me to keep back, and ran on herself.",
"She knew they would be likely to hurt her.",
"Some one had closed the door, and I could not get out.",
"Then he ran up the street and we followed him.",
"After such a long time that it seemed to me it must be the middle of the night, the door at the end of the car opened, and a man looked in.",
"I ran up this walk, and looked into the first building I came to.",
"It was just like a meeting of grown people, and I was surprised to see how good those children were.",
"That finished father.",
"I ran to the door and looked out.",
"I always did this several times through the night, just to see if she was quite safe.",
"She ran to the door and looked out, but there was no one to be seen.",
"Poor little animal!",
"It seems to me that they are getting worse and worse every year, and worry the animals more.",
"Then I started up and ran outside.",
"It seemed as if we were there for hours, but in reality it was only a short time.",
"The movement of the pair was only seen because he watched for it.",
"He did not come straight from home here.",
"Some months passed and the street was opened.",
"The manager had written her a note.",
"He became as cold as ice.",
"The campaign opened.",
"A whole literature has been written on it of late.",
"Such, or somewhat such, is the fact.",
"Little in that direction is given to him, and of him little shall be required.",
"No control of the human soul is possible until it too will be taken in hand by them.",
"What is variation?",
"Think of the human soul.",
"She said she had lived with the doctor for some time.",
"Whatever else he is, man is a land animal with ideas.",
"He ran through the list.",
"They know him all right, from sad experience.",
"They ran on.",
"They certainly came from the direction of the home camp.",
"Somehow no one seemed to care about doing that.",
"Well, then, I rather think he can dance with his own daughter.",
"Those countries must have it somehow.",
"A straight fight!",
"It was all up with my museum.",
"All that good ice!",
"To break the ice.",
"I told him if it was a good secret, they could.",
"I should worry.",
"Anyway, I should worry.",
"No one else seemed to miss him.",
"Either way it might have hurt him.",
"I should worry about that.",
"She was much surprised at looking up to find him in her presence.",
"Go then and forget me.",
"Give me my clothes.",
"There were details of military organization to be announced.",
"In a moment the fight was somewhat more equal.",
"It hurt!",
"Fully half of the class members had left the room by this time.",
"All day I ran about the town, finding out.",
"Do not forget.",
"I knew the matter was in safe hands.",
"He did not miss it that he did not love his father, but he would have given more than a little if he might respect him.",
"He would not hurt her, he would only look at her out of his wild eyes and talk to her.",
"Was it not a part of his human nature to grow older?",
"Could she be human and not grow old?",
"He was left on the coast.",
"Was it such a very sad story then?",
"I never heard a secret in my life.",
"He was usually willing to bet on anything.",
"Yet I feel that I must tell something of that great second half, which nobody who saw it will ever forget.",
"So the talk ran on.",
"Then he closed the door.",
"Then they ran out into the night.",
"This seemed an excellent opening.",
"Did he drop anybody before they got him?",
"But he was beginning to forget fear.",
"Once released, what would the result be?",
"He loved him as his own soul.",
"To tell the sad truth, they were just as strong as ever.",
"He closed the hand in both his own.",
"Any word picture of either would probably fit anyone of a score of people of the same life.",
"How sad for him!",
"His soul!",
"Poor soul!",
"He kept that as a secret.",
"They both went east.",
"They did not know whether to go east any longer or not.",
"In reality she herself would not have lived there for an hour.",
"She quite surprised me.",
"However, there is no cause to worry.",
"I want my children to be entirely my own.",
"But what a lot of trouble and worry!",
"Was it possible to forget their dear daughter?",
"From this moment the conversation became general.",
"And nothing sad but I.",
"The general situation we have already indicated.",
"They see little, but they see it straight.",
"We must remember that upon the kind of stories we tell the child depends much of his later taste in literature.",
"Beat him, mother!",
"Many sad things had happened since she had last seen me.",
"I felt that even yet we were not entirely safe.",
"He had had almost the same trouble with himself, when he looked in the glass that morning.",
"The secret was out.",
"The doctor always knows.",
"The experiment is a novel one.",
"Many things combined to make the last phase pass quickly.",
"We will prevent any need for its exercise.",
"He examined the ice wall from a distance, however, as far as possible.",
"In no direction was a sign to be seen.",
"The plot was carried out to the letter.",
"He was given an hour to decide.",
"But the doctor had gone.",
"She was looking straight in front of her.",
"Is it a secret?",
"A girl is a closed book.",
"They ran straight along the road.",
"It was the face of a man who had seen something that he would never forget.",
"She looked over its pages into the fire.",
"She was called upon to decide her whole life then and there.",
"Yet we think it somewhat.",
"His conversation is as a book.",
"They can at most but give them a direction.",
"Yet somehow the old house is not quite what it should be.",
"A thing was worth buying then, when we felt the money that we paid for it.",
"I told him so, and I shall not soon forget the look he gave me.",
"The sad one is, that they may be sent to the south and sold.",
"Another feature in the scene gave a living, but most sad interest to it.",
"I went and met the manager.",
"I was indeed sad when it all ended.",
"I had some food there and went straight off to sleep.",
"After she finished with it, I started writing it in fair.",
"He seemed to give us more exercise than all of us put together gave him.",
"Was it ever supposed, that in all cases their decisions were right?",
"How can power appear but by the exercise of it?",
"We were, by a great majority, clear for the experiment.",
"Her husband said, he was more hurt by her want of confidence in him, than by the loss of his money.",
"This last error was far worse than the first.",
"I wish I could forget it myself.",
"It is an especially good game for a man who has had to believe that life will always beat him.",
"He was entirely serious.",
"She indicated that the interview was at an end.",
"But I released her hand.",
"At times like these she might even seem to forget.",
"That finished me.",
"Now I am safe.",
"The land is wide enough for us both, and while we work and fight and grow together, each may learn something from the other.",
"How different has been the reality, however!",
"His language would lead one to believe that his soul is entirely lost.",
"How could we tell he was a doctor?",
"I would do anything to turn the child of my friend from his evil ways, but forget my own.",
"The door was closed after him, and the room became dark.",
"He then changed the conversation.",
"There is the secret of their power.",
"That conversation determined the history of his life.",
"Their talk was short and sad.",
"What part of myself can I reform except my actions?",
"My soul is with her long before.",
"The result, for the time being at any has, however, been to stop violence.",
"The method of violence cannot do good in the long run.",
"He ran no risk.",
"They came to our country originally for the purpose of trade.",
"For him the way is straight.",
"They state that even their property is not safe.",
"I ran the risk and if I was set free I would still do the same.",
"I wanted to avoid violence.",
"From that day I began to grow old as fast as I could.",
"After a time she was brought out and left entirely alone in the middle of the great space.",
"And when his eyes were opened, what did he see?",
"I had a deal of conversation with them as to their religious experience.",
"It was a day of great exercise of body and mind.",
"After they had ended I went out and had a long conversation with them.",
"We met in the street, and he conducted us to his house.",
"They ran down the road to meet it.",
"Everybody was surprised.",
"She made several efforts to speak before she could fully control herself.",
"Try and forget it.",
"Her eyes were half closed.",
"He looked at himself in the glass.",
"He was safe.",
"The door closed.",
"There was a wonderful opening.",
"The power of the writer had seemed to grow, hour by hour.",
"If she said that he was safe, he must be.",
"Then I shall be safe.",
"She set her glass down quickly.",
"The door opened and closed.",
"She closed the door.",
"I have never been near the bank.",
"Then he held up his glass.",
"The doctor heard the story half an hour later.",
"When we reached the bank I looked round.",
"At that moment I saw the safe.",
"I forget.",
"Somehow I knew that she would speak, and she did.",
"Give him a place in this bank.",
"It might have been said of the pair that neither had known how to live, but each knew how to die.",
"Again he closed his eyes.",
"Dad would like that too.",
"I was much surprised to meet him.",
"His father had been manager of the bank before him.",
"And as I say, the bank people meant to get hold of him.",
"Should he wait until the woman came out and let her see that he was on the track?",
"Often he turned his eyes in that direction.",
"Somehow she could not realize that she was to die.",
"The situation was entirely beyond his control.",
"For an hour longer the dance continued.",
"His eyes opened.",
"Behind them he could see the opening.",
"How many times had they gone around the track?",
"One time, on such a return, I remember a bit of conversation we had.",
"It is being opened.",
"Soon, soon I shall know, for now I see the east is growing red.",
"His hair was allowed to grow.",
"His eyes were closed, but he could not sleep.",
"But I did not at first see clearly what the error might be.",
"I had some little conversation with her, but I did not learn her name.",
"I may not know much about art and taste, but I know my world.",
"Before she had gone far he ran after her.",
"He moved and opened his eyes.",
"As if she could forget!",
"It all depends.",
"He had asked her to think of it, to decide, to give him an answer.",
"He met no one on his way back to the house, and went straight to his room.",
"Chance was making his hard road straight.",
"His face was dark and heavy.",
"She was the star of the ball which I have just left.",
"Here it is to be noted that he made not only the soul with the body, but he made both body and soul.",
"As I finished, my daughter came in.",
"The door was opened.",
"A door could be seen, but no other opening.",
"They approved his action.",
"They approved of this.",
"It was opened.",
"What he is killing in this moment is the country!",
"He continued to drive straight on.",
"He had half opened the door.",
"The people need direction.",
"All was at an end in that direction.",
"We went away one by one, and each in his own direction.",
"Not one of those of the morning was missing.",
"He finished speaking.",
"One of them at length opened.",
"I opened my eyes.",
"Nothing is more common than for parents during this period to give their children animal food.",
"This is a great error.",
"That central body was in reality no government at all.",
"They had not found a human being, nor had they seen a single animal.",
"There was in reality no head to the government.",
"I am heavy.",
"Be not sad.",
"No hurt.",
"Be secret.",
"Who must dance with him?",
"It was soon finished.",
"This is an error.",
"Only we must not forget that it is the effect and not the cause.",
"I forget what his answer was, but in this case it really cut no figure.",
"Somehow I lost interest in things, and knew I needed a rest.",
"They would decide when the time came.",
"And somehow she did not seem less.",
"There is no plot to the story of what I know of these dear friends of mine whom I cannot see now.",
"He would decide the matter from the relative quality of the catch.",
"It has no plot, and is but the record of events.",
"He sent for the doctor.",
"The doctor was conservative in his expression.",
"How is it that women so have the gift of speech at night?",
"Combined, they made something beautiful and wonderful.",
"Nothing has happened to hurt him.",
"He felt safe.",
"Another showed in the east.",
"One day a very sad case was being tried.",
"His bill was by no means heavy, and he brought him quite round again.",
"Such is the value in literature and argument of long words without meaning.",
"But as nothing happened, we did not leave the room, and went on with the conversation.",
"Upon such small points the great issue of a case often depends.",
"And there would be money in the bank for the first time since we were married!",
"Then once more he opened his eyes and looked up to ask where he was.",
"But the point which concerns us now is simply this.",
"But the trouble was to decide in which direction that action should be taken.",
"Nearly an hour went by in this fashion.",
"Now for the manager.",
"How to stop the animal, though.",
"They could be opened only from the outside.",
"That closed the subject for the present.",
"The manager had a car to himself.",
"He ran to the side of the house.",
"He released his hold on him.",
"The manager ran forward and put up his hand.",
"If not, they will be sent on to us on direction.",
"He closed the door and turned back into the room.",
"But then dad is up on politics and we are not.",
"Then she closed the book.",
"She seemed to want to keep her secret, the dear baby!",
"Another friend who happened to be present came into the conversation at this point.",
"Take the law and the evidence, and decide upon it.",
"And what if the person in the park had known it?",
"How long it was before he again opened his eyes he could not tell.",
"Of course such a conversation could not be real.",
"Me, I talk straight.",
"They closed in with a run.",
"In reality it could have been only a few minutes.",
"I had my eyes opened this trip.",
"It must have been an experience to try the soul.",
"He looked in the direction from which he had come.",
"Neither of them let the other drop behind him.",
"He closed it behind him.",
"There was already one score to his credit, of course.",
"The head man opened his eyes.",
"His hand shot straight out.",
"His eyes closed.",
"They made heavy going of it.",
"None the less her blood beat fast.",
"He looked at her, surprised.",
"Either coast.",
"His eyes looked very kind, and a little sad.",
"They had closed the door behind them.",
"I would have given my soul.",
"But if I could avoid it, I meant, in any case, to put off a long conversation until later.",
"She seemed surprised by what she saw, and very much interested.",
"There were always such things every night, especially after the opening of a new play.",
"The kind of a man that I shall be next month depends upon the kind of a man that I have been this month.",
"I am a doctor myself.",
"But now my eyes are opened.",
"Him have good and useful glass head.",
"He went straight into it.",
"I have seen it, and it is sad.",
"One doctor, doing nothing with an air of confidence, and the patient gets well!",
"Everything depends then on the child.",
"I am a doctor.",
"No woman can decide such issues.",
"She opened the door.",
"She ran into the house.",
"To dance before him.",
"She had never talked in this fashion to any one.",
"Say, but we were surprised!",
"They were still at table when the front door opened.",
"The street door was closed.",
"We did not get them quite straight.",
"I always came in for my share each year, but my clothes were somewhat different.",
"All in the house immediately got up and ran out.",
"Taste it and see.",
"She means when we grow older.",
"In trying to avoid them I ran against them.",
"It could go no longer in that direction, at least.",
"No one expected them to decide the day they first heard of argument.",
"He conducted it in person, and did not lose a man.",
"In every event she determined, after a few minutes of thought, not to speak of the message, or the present, to a living soul.",
"Now the end of school was announced.",
"Could the child have a secret trouble?",
"It gives them a kind of opening.",
"It was still hot but with a heat different from the heat of yesterday.",
"There is a new doctor.",
"A doctor has to have an office.",
"A place which needs a doctor and which this particular doctor needs.",
"The doctor started.",
"At any rate, there was no time to worry, for the doctor was already coming up the walk.",
"She needs new clothes.",
"It will be quite safe.",
"All I need now is direction.",
"I have lots and lots of new clothes.",
"It is quite safe.",
"The doctor knew at once that something serious must have happened and went down to see.",
"She closed her eyes as she had done before.",
"The doctor was not of the party.",
"That is the worst of being a doctor.",
"What she is going through now is saving her, body and soul.",
"It is sad.",
"So I ran.",
"Others come, grow older, go away, but they remain.",
"She kept the key to the cash box and had charge of the safe.",
"Now, then, what about a doctor?",
"Now, then, where did the secret get out?",
"That beat him.",
"To know what an animal is, therefore, we must know something of its family tree.",
"There was no reason why the doctor should know anything about it.",
"He closed with his man.",
"This round must decide it.",
"The conversation, too, was of nothing else.",
"He held a secret, and he meant to use it.",
"How can they score over each other if we do not do the same?",
"If they served their papers in this fashion, then he must do the same.",
"I tried it once for an experiment.",
"I did not wish to hurt him if I could help it.",
"Have I not a soul to save?",
"Get off the track!",
"I knew there was money back of the boy by the looks of his clothes.",
"The office door closed behind the boy, and he went out into the street and turned toward home.",
"He asked his heart the question, but, somehow, it would not say yes.",
"But he did not know in which direction to turn.",
"His feet began to hurt him.",
"The eyes of every one else in the room were turned in that direction also.",
"He put his face once more to the opening.",
"He opened his eyes to see.",
"He gave his clothes to him, and helped him to dress.",
"But they found nothing, no sign whatever of the missing boy.",
"I was near when he opened it.",
"Writing and conversation compared.",
"I wish he would make the experiment.",
"All that was told might be true, and yet in reality there might be nothing to see.",
"But it is not so in reality.",
"We had no conversation.",
"They dance here every night.",
"When he came, their names were announced to him.",
"We had but a single star to light us on our way.",
"I do not say, but that there may be some attacks which will hurt an author.",
"I remember but little of our conversation.",
"Forget me not!",
"Why did she look so sad?",
"He opened the door of the study.",
"But now we shall get things a bit straight, I hope.",
"The doctor stopped in front of her.",
"She turned her face away from the doctor.",
"Could we learn that, perhaps we should know the secret of life.",
"Cells are associated and combined in many ways to form a simple tissue.",
"Note its beat.",
"For the production of heat, therefore, food is necessary.",
"The production, like the loss, of heat is to a certain extent under the control of the will.",
"These are associated and combined in many ways.",
"In all such cases send at once for the doctor.",
"Let us forget it all for this one night.",
"She is soul of my soul!",
"She would never forget nor change.",
"But no, the way is closed up behind her.",
"The parents kept their secret from each other.",
"At last, he closed his eyes.",
"These base actions affected her very much.",
"He turned and ran.",
"Her husband met her, and took the money, and beat her.",
"And those that were with me saw many figures, but myself I only saw one, sitting there by the bank where the trees fell.",
"A black cat was sitting straight up before the fire.",
"For a moment he saw the face of a dead brother rise up before him, and then he turned and ran.",
"His soul could not rest.",
"Has just received her clothes.",
"Another conversation between them.",
"Her clothes not come!",
"My clothes were brought to me just now.",
"I shall now judge how far the rest depends upon myself!",
"She opened not her door.",
"Be not surprised.",
"He decided to go to sleep and forget about it.",
"But it found the opening and came through, and then he saw it was a little old woman.",
"By night, though, all would be finished.",
"Then they ran on.",
"It almost hurt.",
"It was all too sad.",
"It looked as though it had never been opened.",
"But let us forget.",
"He had never been to a dance before, and just at first he did not think there would be much fun in it.",
"As this would keep him quite late, and he was to report to her on his return, no one else would be likely to miss him until morning.",
"The others followed her example, and soon the house was closed against the elements.",
"That sure does hurt!",
"At last the door opened and they were coming out.",
"And to his trial we will follow straight.",
"Now hope I sure of money not to miss.",
"But here the doctor comes.",
"I hurt?",
"My soul!",
"Her taste in dress is perfect.",
"Somehow, the police seem to know me.",
"I cannot decide myself.",
"But I would hurt him, though I knew I should die for it.",
"How they would miss her!",
"Listen to this voice, and do not forget it!",
"Her secret had been well kept.",
"Life was very heavy for him.",
"There was something heavy on her heart.",
"So the letter ran.",
"At that time appeared a star, which was seen of many.",
"His soul went its way.",
"Forget it.",
"Across the back of the room ran the long bar.",
"The man that had come to the door was behind the bar.",
"He closed the door without a sound.",
"It will take longer, perhaps, but it is absolutely safe.",
"Fair bet.",
"I knew that I must get at what was inside the safe before they did.",
"He felt somehow out of the picture.",
"I should have been off his track.",
"He looked surprised and hurt.",
"To some extent it is the actual face of the man himself.",
"And of such to a great extent was the population of the place.",
"Nobody however was hurt, just because nobody was in the building at the time.",
"Clothes taking fire.",
"Much depends on the mother.",
"How long this exercise should be continued.",
"Error of schools.",
"Error of families.",
"A common error.",
"How can they change their clothes every day?",
"It is never so well to heat it by the fire.",
"Here comes out an important secret.",
"There is little action in the plot.",
"Take away the soul of woman, and what is she?",
"The story is at last finished.",
"She looked at him a little surprised.",
"She knew that in reality they had no hope themselves.",
"He opened his book, and began to read.",
"Then they may drop the book, to pass at once into the region of thought without words.",
"Certain it is I was right, and yet I am also in error.",
"Can I forget it?",
"Let his works decide.",
"He is cold and dead in heart and mind and soul.",
"The letter was opened and read.",
"The services were opened in due form.",
"It was dark when we ran into the city.",
"Now, who shall decide?",
"Sister of my soul!",
"They can dance.",
"It is her own secret.",
"Poor old soul!",
"I want to dance.",
"I should like to dance!",
"She is safe!",
"It was long before he was released.",
"They were upon my track.",
"It must be so, for now she could not tell whether she was sad or happy.",
"A door to the left opened.",
"There can be no secret about it now that every one knows it.",
"He ran up to the open door, a letter in his hand.",
"Her eyes closed.",
"His eyes ran all over him.",
"He is safe!",
"What law cannot decide, is usually determined by might, and such was the case here.",
"How sad for them to be left!",
"I alone of my family knew the secret.",
"How they did dance!",
"He should not miss a face that he had known and liked.",
"The dance was finished.",
"I know what her old home was when she was like the soul of it, and how it changed when she was gone and lost.",
"A few people were hurt, but much less damage was done than might have been expected.",
"The most important things a man has are his body, his soul, and his money.",
"Even had chance or taste led her to choose a similar subject, she would have treated it otherwise.",
"It did not appear to be in need of anything but a soul.",
"For the child could not have heard a word of the conversation.",
"But this is not a real animal.",
"But there was no animal.",
"She opened the door and went to her room.",
"Even he could see that to make up a charge would not be safe.",
"I had never heard of the star before.",
"The race was twice around the track.",
"Around they went in the same positions.",
"Every star is out.",
"Then the doctor came on board.",
"I never forget the present.",
"But what direction?",
"Our heart is opened wide.",
"After these things he must be released for a short time.",
"Also another book was opened, which is the book of life.",
"But he had asked for it to be kept secret.",
"I was too full with the wonder of all I had to forget to know that I had to forget it.",
"I had been sad too long already.",
"Tell me the secret, and she will never know.",
"He tried to beat me.",
"The bank goes on.",
"She began the conversation.",
"Almost immediately followed the sound of a heavy fall.",
"He closed his eyes and looked again.",
"It is more important that we should decide upon our future course of action.",
"At last I opened my door.",
"I made very heavy weather of it.",
"The world is such a dance!",
"I ran like hell.",
"I doubt, however, if it be as bad as not being allowed to speak, which I have tried fully, and do not like.",
"That is the hard part of literature.",
"It all depends upon the point of view, and I call it news.",
"This style did very well, but is now out of fashion.",
"This I wish to sell, cash down.",
"I do, but it is a secret.",
"It seems as if literature were coming to a stand.",
"I have now something heavy on my mind.",
"Understand that there will be nothing funny in the following pages.",
"I am going at it straight.",
"A light, a star.",
"To dance, play.",
"Thus, then, of literature as her help, and thus of art.",
"What is it that I wish in reality?",
"Having finished his business with the old man, he turned to me.",
"And in fact, if the living do not see, the dead are surprised.",
"Those who see any difference between soul and body have neither.",
"Many important subjects are necessarily passed over.",
"The children sit up as late as their parents, and are included in all their conversation.",
"I have had a great deal of interesting conversation with him.",
"It was all because he had no clothes on.",
"As the day began, so it closed."],

["Is it for this I have made peace by land and sea?",
"This house, how ancient it is!",
"I was walking up and down, reading.",
"I looked up to the window, again.",
"I knew, now, that there was no more reason to fear an attack from this quarter.",
"Then, all grew suddenly dark.",
"All had happened so quickly and suddenly.",
"How still was the sea!",
"An idea had come, suddenly.",
"After a time, I go to the window, and, opening it, look out.",
"Tomorrow, it will eat into my face.",
"We were just sitting down to it, when he returned.",
"The things were quickly removed.",
"A great many people were walking about and sitting under the trees.",
"I suppose no one would listen to it in these days.",
"However, they enjoyed it very much.",
"They exist to be changed!",
"Even yet, we are all too stupid.",
"What is true of a word, and what we make of it, is true of every phase of learning.",
"Trade is a just exchange of what one man has for what another man needs.",
"Nature never intended that a man should do one thing all his life.",
"We remained away for more than a year.",
"Not a word had he to say when he returned.",
"Suddenly he looked up.",
"Up to now my standing with the men had been well enough.",
"We started up the west coast.",
"Have a drink.",
"It was not absolutely essential.",
"It has just occurred to me.",
"At the end of an hour he returned.",
"That was a fixed fact.",
"It is a hard lot that the children of our cities have in life.",
"Serve with coffee.",
"Serve hot or cold with coffee.",
"We suppose not.",
"But she turned not towards him.",
"Well, coffee, then.",
"This is the most perfect and complete machine in the world.",
"Please trust me.",
"The moment the door closed behind his wife, he started up and asked me if I would mind coming with him into his library.",
"We were standing in the room as he said the words.",
"That is the reason it cannot be removed.",
"We were standing in the library.",
"They were very good to me, and gave me coffee before I left.",
"She must do some shopping.",
"It hurt him, and he enjoyed it.",
"He saw her through the window.",
"She had been taking him on some mission of clothes.",
"It was not in her to go in for competition.",
"She seemed to assume they were to be like brother and sister.",
"He suddenly stopped, and held out his hand.",
"He was sitting on the side of the bed and holding his head.",
"One day a man came to the mission house.",
"She had a window put in.",
"Keep the other people from doing murder.",
"They went to the mission house.",
"Now there was a fine mission house.",
"They wanted her advice.",
"Mission houses, schools, and a church have been built.",
"But her work as judge did not stop her from doing her mission work.",
"She fixed the house herself.",
"I tried it on, but made bad work of walking.",
"Nor is there the difference one might suppose.",
"Is the exchange never to stop?",
"The boy stopped and fixed his eyes on me.",
"I picked up the papers.",
"All at once it occurred to him to try taking off his clothes.",
"Coffee within reach of the range.",
"Suppose we try it again.",
"The weather was fair and the ground in excellent condition.",
"It was stupid of me to trip and fall like that.",
"They were standing near the window at some distance from me.",
"We then discussed the situation, which to say the least, looked pretty blue.",
"The sea also is here.",
"Money is one of the greatest things in the world.",
"It never occurred to him to do so before.",
"She went into the house and returned with a book in her hand.",
"My taste is science and I measure tape.",
"People died suddenly sometimes.",
"The girl held the note towards her.",
"Winter had come.",
"And the long winter is before us.",
"Say, boys!",
"And winter fell on the world for the first time.",
"Winter was down on the camp again.",
"I can go in winter as good as summer.",
"They drink it in the whole summer night as well as all the day.",
"That window!",
"But it had grown to be a practice with them not to trust themselves to talk at this hour.",
"Suddenly a face.",
"His eyes were fixed upon her now.",
"I think I am changing, somehow.",
"He studied this now.",
"Most of it is still held in trust for our boy, who is named after him.",
"Probably this is because we never talk about the first man, but about how things were discovered.",
"The visitors felt, rather than knew, that the thing was right.",
"The teacher must first of all visit the place and see what it is likely to give the children.",
"The winter days are very short.",
"Of course I often found less than this, but not in what I considered the main channel.",
"The exchange, however, was not to take place that year.",
"Suddenly he stopped.",
"I looked him square in the eyes.",
"He heard me out with his eyes fixed on the ground.",
"I do not think we are discovered, but we cannot stay here.",
"Suddenly it was before me.",
"They came towards me, and the light fell on the face of the second.",
"I am the son of him who returned.",
"We must have left a door or a window open somewhere.",
"A few minutes later they started off to pick up the girls on the way to the station.",
"So they called the boys.",
"The boys went off, leaving the girls to themselves.",
"Was there no way in which a message could reach those who remained behind?",
"I suppose he must be right.",
"The days passed on, and no new event occurred in this little history.",
"But when she turned to look if there was any way, she found one standing by such as she had not yet seen.",
"It was a great city, but it was not like the great cities which she had seen.",
"There is always something new to be discovered.",
"On to the cities of the night!",
"But he was not even aware that I was there.",
"To me that was a matter of little importance.",
"What ground, then, remained for confidence?",
"Most of his time was spent in his library, as had always been the case.",
"But I did not care for the connection.",
"My law is fixed.",
"But nothing of the kind has ever occurred again.",
"Because they have not documents enough, nor men learned enough.",
"They exist in men.",
"After a performance of that kind he generally comes and tells me about it.",
"West thought it over.",
"Suddenly the press stopped.",
"They considered this advice seriously.",
"Now what has taken place in the course of this operation?",
"Suddenly the land changes.",
"We discovered it this morning.",
"How stupid he had been!",
"Then suppose we reached the spot?",
"The fire was returned.",
"They shall not murder him!",
"She told her story simply, and asked his advice as to the course to be followed.",
"When she reached home she found her father in the library.",
"She must now do justice.",
"How their advice failed!",
"I suppose so.",
"I found the only and original one intended for me.",
"I had the boys together.",
"He still did not quite trust her.",
"There was no competition.",
"He seemed to be learning new things every moment about his brother.",
"I placed it all before him.",
"She saw suddenly that she must continue to play her part.",
"It was from one of these that he had just returned.",
"He was standing just inside the door.",
"He stopped suddenly, and his face went white and then red.",
"I fixed it so when I come here.",
"But one thing remained to her out of it all.",
"Why had it not occurred to her before?",
"Something was the matter with the machine, I believe.",
"They just had to trust me.",
"The end came suddenly.",
"Another way that he had of learning was by seeing things with his own eyes.",
"Nobody in this country had ever seen a teacher like him.",
"He was a great teacher.",
"At last the doctors said he could not get well.",
"The country was new, and there were not many pictures in it.",
"He made other pictures.",
"He was making pictures.",
"With this the boy had made his pictures.",
"But it was winter.",
"There was no door or window in the back of a house.",
"At school he learned what other boys did.",
"Most boys want to learn what other boys learn.",
"The teacher tried it, and found it very good.",
"But he was a favorite with his teacher.",
"Like other wild boys, he thought of running away.",
"He wanted to go to sea.",
"It was still standing.",
"To please the boy he got him a book with pictures in it.",
"He had to do his writing with a machine.",
"In that part of the world it is night nearly all winter.",
"The long winter night was over.",
"Sometimes when he missed, the big boys would not take the head.",
"It seemed funny that anybody should think of this poor boy becoming a great man.",
"He learned more in a day than some boys do in a month.",
"She wanted to become a teacher.",
"The connection between these words is obvious.",
"We are aware that the world is made up of various classes and conditions of men.",
"In this condition we were all led to the camp.",
"As soon as I heard of his going to sea, I immediately set out to go and prevent it if possible.",
"It was obvious they had not reached the construction camp.",
"He studied her.",
"He studied the group.",
"Sometimes the boys made trouble about their pay.",
"Suppose I bought some shares in the line?",
"His son sold the business to a small company, in which he took shares.",
"Walking in the town she saw a man whose figure and step she thought she knew.",
"It never occurred to him to wonder how she came there.",
"How near rest and home came to him in this woman standing there!",
"He looks from the window now, his thought having time to close upon himself.",
"Holding the letter thus, a face came to memory.",
"They passed on, and left me standing there.",
"She looked up and met my eyes fixed on her.",
"I had returned too late.",
"The sea is a real thing to him.",
"I went to the window, and let in reality with the morning light.",
"We had the window open, looking out over the sea.",
"There will be economy along the less essential lines to meet the cost.",
"That they could fight, both boys had shown more than once.",
"Suddenly he gave a start.",
"The leader moved toward the sea and none of the others followed him.",
"I may have to break a window.",
"But in a way he discovered the crime.",
"This one I picked out of the wall over there.",
"His first knowledge of this was the account of the murder, which he read in the papers.",
"It might have remained a week or more before being discovered.",
"Stupid that I am to forget things so important.",
"And it had been murder!",
"Suddenly I heard one.",
"I had no hand in her murder, if murder it is found out to be.",
"But the doctors say it will be weeks before they can allow a question of any importance to be put to her.",
"But he has a good eye, and will get along with the boys all right.",
"Indeed, we think that one such does exist.",
"Then he began to study the ground in this direction, as he had already studied it in front.",
"Something has occurred.",
"It came suddenly, as all great changes come.",
"I have studied every word of the case, to see if what I had to tell would help him any.",
"In an hour or so, I had left the house to get a drink.",
"I was in no condition to notice.",
"I took it out, and held it towards her.",
"He will not wish to write them, tomorrow.",
"That made me drink, also.",
"Suddenly she started up, and I saw a great change in her.",
"But one chance remained for me now.",
"He went only as far as the spot where the man had been standing.",
"Give me the chain.",
"Where the fight had been he was looking, at what little remained of the old leader.",
"She was holding her baby close to her breast.",
"Then he returned to her.",
"Through all the long winter the water about his home is as necessary to him as fire to a child.",
"Suddenly she stopped.",
"When the first husband returned, he found that she had gone.",
"He returned home.",
"When he offers us coffee, drink only a little of it.",
"They returned to their house.",
"He returned to his father, who gave him the book.",
"They turned toward the sea.",
"I was there last winter.",
"Suppose that there was something in this?",
"It is certain it cannot be in winter.",
"Of such doctors there is no lack.",
"It is essential that they should feel that the peace is just and equal for all.",
"Often enough on reasons which cannot be isolated or defined.",
"Now I am not very sure how this would work with some boys and girls.",
"But he had another teacher.",
"He gave it no quarter himself, however.",
"I never could trust myself so far as that, nearly.",
"He got up, of course, and looked from the window.",
"How can a body be so stupid!",
"He felt our eyes upon him and suddenly raised his head.",
"We looked down from the window and saw that the house had already caught fire.",
"No time has remained for nice investigation.",
"Its importance is too obvious.",
"No machine could be found.",
"This war is the greatest the world has ever seen.",
"The crime was signed.",
"To this letter he at once returned an answer.",
"The doctor says that she cannot possibly live through the next winter.",
"He started suddenly and looked at me.",
"Would he tell me anything when he became aware of all I knew?",
"If we are discovered they will fire.",
"Then other things occurred.",
"She knew the secret of those men, and they intended to kill her.",
"What she said to him I am not, of course, aware.",
"The advice was quickly taken.",
"Of course they had been removed by violence.",
"When it returned is not known.",
"Small boys.",
"Take my advice.",
"Some went forward earlier and others later than had been intended.",
"We soon discovered the cause.",
"He seemed about to turn from the window, and then something outside held his attention.",
"It must be the sea air which makes me so.",
"There is nothing like a drink to rest one.",
"Every man in town will know it tomorrow morning.",
"To my mind, it was not intended that I or anyone else should miss them.",
"It will be no secret tomorrow.",
"He signed it in full, name and address.",
"He was sitting with his back to the large window.",
"When he returned, after walking a little way down the road, the door was closed.",
"But that condition passed quickly.",
"He was there on the night of the murder, too.",
"They looked through the window.",
"My boys are at school.",
"Religious character of the ancient city.",
"The ancient city as a school for political training.",
"Some of them are still believed to be in perfect condition.",
"Such an opportunity soon occurred.",
"A year later occurred the death of both.",
"Common sense tells us that.",
"And the more a man is what a man should be, the less he can trust it.",
"I trust so, my friends.",
"I fear that few here will take my advice.",
"I trust not.",
"In any case it can have been of small importance.",
"Nor are they of very much importance.",
"The church, of course, remained.",
"He sent for his mother and related to her all that had occurred.",
"Of course I did not always station myself in the same tree, but sometimes in one place, sometimes in another.",
"Only the lawyer had as yet discovered them.",
"She did not know what to do in this emergency, or what more to say.",
"I am stupid, and lose myself in what I write.",
"It is like reading evidence given in a court of justice.",
"But through the office window we could see the man we wanted.",
"The next is written in a very good hand, upon a square piece of very blue writing paper.",
"He looks in at the window.",
"He had seen it when it first came out and, although he enjoyed it at the time, he felt he was getting too old for that sort of stuff.",
"A walking television set.",
"I heard a good example of this sort of thing on my sports channel just the other day.",
"A window!",
"There was a window!",
"He picked himself up.",
"Then he picked himself up and tried again.",
"Such is the condition in which we stand.",
"Suppose we make the distance they may walk, the same distance that a man can go and come in a day.",
"The effect was very different from what was intended.",
"Perfect trust all day.",
"One led to another, and yesterday boys were coming all day to sign.",
"She was placed next him, and they had the entire conversation to themselves.",
"They were now both walking in the same way.",
"It was wonderful that no one discovered that I was not the same child.",
"The apartment in which I was to sleep was at the top of the house.",
"Perhaps later, when the winter has come, I will follow.",
"He was easily led, I suppose.",
"Then, suddenly, he looked up.",
"Quite suddenly she stopped.",
"I want to go back this winter.",
"She turned down the page of her book, and looking up suddenly, met his eyes, for a moment only.",
"Then suddenly she went away without saying it.",
"He opened the door and followed her into the apartment, which has already been described.",
"Well, that is all ancient history.",
"She went west with the papers.",
"Then suddenly she changed the conversation.",
"It is not to drink.",
"A whole length of it had been removed.",
"But he turned and looked at the window.",
"He knew the expression of the face that was looking out of the window.",
"They remained thus for a moment.",
"And between man and man it is not always justice that is required.",
"Of course he could see that the study would not be much, even if he signed up for it, being just for a week, but it might not be bad fun.",
"The boys found it so this night.",
"And last night, just as I was leaving one of the boys after the camp fire he said something about what I might do with my life.",
"But he did not quite trust himself.",
"She was not at all in love with either of the boys, nor they with her.",
"The same condition was true of the country people.",
"They enjoyed themselves, and so did everybody else.",
"But the wonderful thing to me is that, after all this time, I should suddenly have found this out for myself!",
"There was no standing all this.",
"Then came the winter.",
"And, doing so, suddenly he heard his own name called.",
"She is, therefore, a person of far more importance in a community than she usually thinks she is.",
"The next morning I missed my little favorite from the window.",
"One must not start in the middle, the teacher told us that.",
"The mother, looking through the window, followed them with her eyes.",
"Have a drink?",
"This is a reform of the greatest importance.",
"I was the only one left standing.",
"No quarter was asked or expected.",
"I have seen men shot so close to one another that they remained standing after death.",
"It was here that the greater part of the fight occurred.",
"I have seen it again and again, men shot so close to one another that they remained standing after death.",
"During the whole of this period the weather has remained fine.",
"Here have we come away and brought never so much as a drop of anything to drink with us.",
"A thing may exist without there being a law for it.",
"One of them raised my head, and placed his hand over my heart.",
"So how can she have returned?",
"He did not come into the house, but simply put his head in through the open window.",
"He sometimes thought that he might have been walking in his sleep.",
"They returned now every year.",
"But if we were to take their advice, we should have nothing of our own left to hold.",
"But that is how we discovered them.",
"Nothing else that it can do is of any importance compared with this.",
"To learn what he tells we have only to listen.",
"He tells us very little.",
"Core, company.",
"The nature of the place made them far more subject to disease both in winter and in summer.",
"His physical condition?",
"Its political development is therefore of great importance for the understanding of its religious growth.",
"I trust him in the same way.",
"Why had the world gone so suddenly wrong?",
"Our course was north by west.",
"It is on chance, I suppose, that the effect of such things depends.",
"In my opinion this would be of the greatest service.",
"They are the greatest in our history.",
"But suppose it were true!",
"But they went beyond the station, across the track, and turned to the right.",
"An isolated car was on fire.",
"Every moment he expected to be discovered.",
"That, after all, was a condition of life.",
"It was only upon giving them up that he discovered their real meaning.",
"The window was small, low, and without glass.",
"What would he do when he discovered she loved him?",
"Most boys going to the front leave many behind whom they love.",
"That they were walking in the open seemed not to matter to him.",
"No hope, the doctors said, and he was getting worse all the time.",
"I have seen and studied at close hand women of all classes.",
"So few doctors and so many patients!",
"No doctors!",
"Somehow the boys took to that.",
"The ends of the world brought together by one war!",
"A single night had contained years, more than years.",
"Boys, take this from me.",
"Winter had passed.",
"Look things in the face square.",
"It was murder.",
"Trust me, my husband!",
"Suppose I have a son, and war comes in his day.",
"There were men standing all around.",
"How he came among us and why he remained, no one can say.",
"At one period she was president of the association, and for many years served as chairman of the committee on science.",
"In fact, she made a point of walking out every day, no matter what the weather might be.",
"Then an idea suddenly occurred to his mind.",
"Otherwise it might never have occurred to him.",
"This movement placed him face to face with me.",
"It was day then, and we were well out at sea.",
"There is no trust to be put in such a man.",
"And why should her body be thus carried about at sea.",
"They started in it as boys many years ago.",
"So they returned to the house.",
"She was used to him saying stupid things.",
"He left the door wide open so that no one might come suddenly upon them and turned to the old man.",
"Some one was standing above her, looking down at her.",
"That would be the justice.",
"So she remained for what seemed a very long time.",
"Neither did much more than drink the strong coffee.",
"She only knew that she had done nothing when at length he returned.",
"When he returned she had not moved.",
"The children ran home from school, and, thought it was cold, for it was almost winter now, they did not mind it.",
"Next he opened a package he had brought home with him.",
"She suddenly wanted to stay.",
"He must get a copy of the paper.",
"In his own apartment he found everything in order.",
"The doctor suddenly came to attention.",
"He intended them to be subject to men.",
"No, I will not hear it discussed.",
"But not even the teacher knew just what.",
"She was standing in front of him now, and her eyes were driving the truth deep into his soul.",
"An opportunity for this exercise of power soon occurred.",
"He had not been much with boys.",
"Do they just walk along the beach and pick it up?",
"Strong to the boys.",
"The other boys paid no attention to them, but went on looking at me.",
"They were good boys in many ways.",
"It was in the winter time.",
"She did not do any more shopping, but turned her face toward the sea.",
"The whole family went to the station to see us off.",
"I suppose they found it easier.",
"At any other time, he could drink all he liked.",
"A great many boys and girls were going in, and we went with them.",
"Once a man down south was going to have one, and he and his boys and friends were talking it over.",
"When I was coming from school, I saw him walking along the track.",
"The boys and girls were so sorry.",
"I do not like the cities.",
"Suppose I did go to a city.",
"He said they were by no means the stupid animals that some people considered them.",
"She was trying to ask his advice.",
"He looked through the window.",
"When a square had been passed there came a sound of men running behind them.",
"Suppose that he went further still.",
"Some boys have no interest whatever in sex.",
"The second period ends in its turn.",
"The boys were all on their feet.",
"Suppose we let the subject rest for a while.",
"I can do justice to it all right.",
"The boys from town often used to come up here.",
"Well, come along, boys.",
"I was in it last winter.",
"Well, I suppose we may as well drive back home.",
"So this is the way we fixed it.",
"This was the letter that we decided to send because I kept the first copy we made.",
"Perhaps I can find something to stand on to reach that window.",
"His back was turned towards the side upon which she was.",
"Then I suppose he is a great man.",
"Winter was coming.",
"They had not intended to go so far.",
"Also a drink.",
"He studied that, to understand her.",
"A sound near the window made him turn.",
"The teacher said that she did not know how to take her own part.",
"They would think he had found her at some mission school.",
"Mother wants to go home as suddenly as that would have been for me, she says.",
"Father had perfect trust in him.",
"His face is all soul when he is learning a new thing.",
"But suppose it had to last all night!",
"I wanted her to know me and trust me.",
"Not think about dress or what we eat or drink?",
"At last came the day for the boys to leave home.",
"It was a heavy weight, and for the moment the boys under it thought they would have to let it go.",
"Then he went out of the office and was gone about a quarter of an hour.",
"During these days the boys did not see the girls, nor did they hear from them.",
"The boys did not know what to do.",
"The boys looked the books over, but found little to interest them.",
"If we have the copy, we can guess at least at what the original is like.",
"Nothing which I can understand, nothing which I can trust in.",
"What were we intended to learn from it?",
"Once he thought the mass was changing direction.",
"So I studied the methods and the great idea come to me.",
"And an emergency is an emergency.",
"Suddenly the ice gave way.",
"The idea of writing some such work first occurred to him many years ago.",
"In any case, her lot remained a very hard one.",
"It occurred to her for the first time that she might possibly lose him.",
"I have seen everything, I have studied everything.",
"She was indeed fast becoming his very life.",
"She was standing in front of her husband, in the full light which came through the window.",
"How can one be so stupid?",
"There was nothing, in fact, fixed and final about it.",
"And, clearly, if anything was intended to be done, the wrong direction was taken from the beginning.",
"That must always be so in a changing world.",
"What, shall I have some drink?",
"Body of me, he means to spend my chain.",
"This, however, is rather a forced construction.",
"He had never seen her do any thing else, and he had the greatest confidence in her knowledge and ability.",
"He knew too much, in fact, and was only too well aware of it.",
"It could not have occurred to such a man that he had been given his dinner at the door of that very house.",
"The coffee was excellent.",
"The boys returned a good deal earlier than anybody had expected, but they made no more trouble.",
"Will our equipment meet the requirements of the situation?",
"In the same way it was possible to reduce the weight of all other items of our equipment.",
"The winter had ended.",
"That is no longer the case in our great cities.",
"Not only in big cities is this the case.",
"I picked it up in the street yesterday.",
"I went down into the street and picked it up.",
"He looked back and made a little movement of the head towards his father.",
"The effect of the good dinner was already wearing off.",
"They went there now and took their morning coffee.",
"They were standing on the wall now.",
"Suddenly he changed his mind and turned away.",
"There are some people one would rather not have in an emergency.",
"She was standing by the window which she had opened.",
"Some coffee.",
"Their importance is from the past.",
"What a place to be in is an old library!",
"Lawyers, I suppose, were children once.",
"We had neither of us seen the sea, and we had never been from home so long together in company.",
"I asked what his station was.",
"It is a huge place with a beach just behind it.",
"This question is of great importance.",
"He did the greatest actions at sea that ever were done.",
"After this, there was no action of much importance.",
"How can his true opinion be discovered?",
"We may trust it will be done.",
"Here is a very ancient well still in use.",
"Measure of land, and value of money, it is of great importance to state with care.",
"And I found him in such a condition!",
"I thought I must suddenly have learned all there is to know.",
"We studied the paper.",
"She was an old woman and fixed.",
"I missed my coffee.",
"And the winter had been an expensive one.",
"In another place he had more money, which he had intended to pay if the smaller bill had been presented.",
"The agent stopped.",
"West offered no comment as they made their selection.",
"West gave me a little money to start me on my way, and the rest of my story is not very interesting to anybody.",
"The girl returned alone.",
"West did not answer for a moment.",
"Suddenly she left the room and did not return.",
"Name, then, the condition.",
"All night they remained there.",
"Give us justice!",
"He received me as a criminal.",
"I suppose it is.",
"The method of the west is violence.",
"At one time I made for myself a home, and remained in it for many, many years without making any change.",
"In fact, I not only studied, but I wrote.",
"I know him, I trust him.",
"What he now wanted from me was medical advice.",
"In a few days he became aware of her critical state.",
"He was a man of station and influence in the town.",
"We could not get away without taking coffee with them.",
"They were interested in the conversation, though nothing of a religious nature occurred.",
"They were asked what they would give towards its support.",
"The time was very short until his men returned.",
"Which of his boys was he going to send?",
"It was no easy matter, although they had the street and number well fixed in their mind.",
"The clothes were returned.",
"To hold out longer is murder.",
"The outside door was suddenly opened and closed.",
"She seemed to have been spending the last quarter of an hour in thought.",
"She was a teacher at the national school.",
"She turned her head towards him.",
"He turned towards the door and then stopped short.",
"Her face suddenly fell.",
"We exist for him.",
"There was murder in his eyes.",
"He often returned to the office after dinner.",
"That in itself is a matter of small importance.",
"Suddenly he released her.",
"Murder indeed!",
"He wanted legal advice.",
"At least, never heard of him until he heard of the murder.",
"That would make good copy.",
"At last the high official turned to the chairman.",
"It never occurred to me.",
"But though they sent a special agent to meet him on his release, they never did get hold of him.",
"She signed him to the window near which they were standing.",
"For a moment the group studied one another.",
"Now, suddenly, he felt that he himself was in their class.",
"And they are so stupid!",
"Go on with the boys.",
"I have studied it out.",
"The other boys were not supposed to make love to her!",
"The boys let him go.",
"Suddenly he saw clearly.",
"Summer in winter!",
"A teacher?",
"At the mission school I learned it was wrong to kill.",
"He tells me that tomorrow I must die.",
"Suddenly she turns her head.",
"His property and funds are held in trust.",
"Murder, indeed!",
"Tomorrow morning she shall have left this house.",
"Indeed I assume it to be so.",
"The men, he said, who could do these great things did not exist in the country.",
"He is walking in his sleep.",
"And is it true that a number of visitors are coming down?",
"But they are not placed as I am.",
"That tells enough of my story.",
"She had never been placed in such a position before.",
"Yes, I suppose so.",
"So suddenly!",
"She is of no importance.",
"Suddenly, as if she felt his presence, she raised her eyes and looked at him.",
"A very large number of the shares were held by him.",
"I suppose not.",
"I suppose he will come back soon, and they will be married.",
"But are these things to be enjoyed?",
"This fair, therefore, is an ancient thing of long standing, and a very great fair.",
"He was standing on a table.",
"All were standing.",
"This done, there remained nothing more but to separate.",
"I went towards it.",
"Suddenly I heard a shot.",
"A book which he had been reading had remained on the table, open at the page where he had left off.",
"Such is our part, our office, our mission.",
"He asked his advice.",
"Suddenly there was a movement.",
"No quarter to be expected.",
"Suddenly a window was opened.",
"I went to the field of murder.",
"We had reached the market quarter.",
"Suddenly he made a sign.",
"They asked for drink.",
"A sort of security suddenly fell upon them.",
"I was right to trust myself to it.",
"He, however, reached the station in safety.",
"It was probably some police agent.",
"The justice of that time, as we know.",
"Suppose I call out?",
"They had no quarter to expect.",
"This is but common justice.",
"It must be removed before any thing else can be done.",
"They returned to the beach.",
"Walking about the ground.",
"Is murder all the story we shall read?",
"Think of what has been discovered.",
"I am going to tell that which I know simply as it occurred.",
"They had been boys again.",
"He could read, holding his book in his left hand, and he read far into the night.",
"An idea occurred to her.",
"To me it was of no importance whatever.",
"I made a rule throughout my professional life to note my cases with the greatest care.",
"I was becoming famous.",
"Such cases have occurred before me.",
"But this is by no means the same as saying that everything ancient is therefore beautiful and true, or that all the old ways are good.",
"Evil is almost, if not quite, as ancient as good.",
"I took him up on condition that he got me a place there.",
"Several years ago one of the boys of this family died.",
"The teacher is coming here to board for the winter.",
"Is that in the library?",
"I went towards him, and found him to be black.",
"What alternative remained?",
"All is well that ends well.",
"Yet he remained.",
"No plan occurred to him now.",
"No alternative remained.",
"How still it suddenly seemed!",
"Suddenly he started and his face changed.",
"Long she looked out of the window.",
"West did not want that.",
"West was in the lead.",
"Now he had no doubt what the man intended.",
"The school of emergency developed them fast.",
"West turned to meet them.",
"He still intended to take the girl with him.",
"West was not quite ready.",
"She would not trust any one but herself to set the table.",
"West would keep going as long and as fast as he could.",
"West did not know it.",
"North by west like we been going.",
"He never had had a square deal.",
"But he could not trust himself.",
"West coast.",
"Suddenly it stopped.",
"There was no time to make a copy.",
"But to me they meant a threat, and as a threat they were intended.",
"He stopped suddenly.",
"But, I suppose, it could not have been that.",
"That would be a stupid thing to do.",
"I leave the question with students of political economy and pass on to a local condition which is not a theory.",
"Competition is no more a law of nature than is hate.",
"There is no criminal class.",
"They discussed the play.",
"Suppose we get married again by somebody or other, and start right off.",
"She went back up the street, walking fast now to get away from them all.",
"Something of this confidence was still upon her when she returned.",
"He had run away, some time before, and, for some reason, had returned.",
"I want to go up and carry the boys something to eat.",
"They only want justice and fair play.",
"Nor was it long before every doubt was removed.",
"This did not occur, however, until another winter was passed.",
"Half a minute placed both, in safety, on the western bank.",
"Is this the case with the language of the sea?",
"Has the sea any language?",
"I suppose.",
"Now winter had set in.",
"She ran to the window.",
"Perhaps they enjoy walking.",
"It was the week, of course, that I returned to college.",
"He was not quite responsible, but in his case it was drink.",
"They will think that, having taken the coffee, the result is certain.",
"Perhaps it was never intended to be used as she is using it.",
"Except when we went shopping.",
"When she returned the girl seemed herself again.",
"Doctors have to be firm of course.",
"In this we must trust no one, and nothing.",
"And it would be nice to have everything ready when the party returned.",
"She remained very much at home.",
"Winter came early.",
"It occurred to me that here was my chance to show what I was made of.",
"He felt that now in truth murder was being done.",
"That was the day of the murder.",
"Is that justice?",
"Many of them drink.",
"Suddenly she put her hands to her face.",
"Suddenly he started back.",
"He was learning.",
"And signed his name.",
"For a long while she remained so.",
"It came upon him quite suddenly.",
"But neither of them had anything of importance to tell.",
"He picked them up one after another and examined them.",
"And suddenly he knew the secret.",
"He turned to his visitors with an air of decision.",
"The chief turned to his coffee.",
"He did not show me a copy of the plan or even mention that one had been put into writing.",
"That difference has already been discussed.",
"At an appropriate place this subject will be more fully discussed.",
"They were placed in a difficult position.",
"It is, therefore a new condition and a new problem.",
"They wanted to get to the sea and to safety.",
"Some were to watch the east, and some the west.",
"Suppose we start in an hour.",
"Then the boys filed out.",
"He was holding the paper close to his eyes, and going over it word by word.",
"Trust us and give us opportunity to do it.",
"Standing thus in the presence of death, the boy had no fear.",
"It was the first fire of the season, and they enjoyed it.",
"Did he get that up alone or did he have a little legal advice?",
"Suppose it should?",
"It only remained to act.",
"But the morning hours went by and the jury still remained in their room.",
"He was not to be without home and love and learning after all.",
"Then he picked up the note and examined it again.",
"Finally, he became aware that the air about him was growing to be very bad.",
"Finally it occurred to him that he should go to some other place in the mine.",
"But at last he came upon it and picked it up.",
"Suppose they should never find it out.",
"He picked it up and examined it.",
"It is certain, there cannot be a free agent, unless there is the power of being evil as well as good.",
"I enjoyed this day much.",
"There could not be greater attention paid to any visitors.",
"There were many pictures.",
"They have a library, and design a room.",
"One side, and I think the east end, are yet standing.",
"A few are yet standing.",
"The house is one square mass.",
"Not a stupid face, however, by any means.",
"He left them, and returned to the study.",
"I suppose all old people get like that.",
"The door opened suddenly.",
"His former words returned upon her memory.",
"Nothing is so essential to success in life as sound physical health.",
"There is, therefore, nothing to prevent the exchange taking place between the blood and the food.",
"Do not take food and drink too hot or too cold.",
"This condition is essential to successful brain action.",
"That, however, remained to be seen.",
"How could the criminal be discovered?",
"They removed again.",
"What now remained to be done?",
"Of course, it was a copy.",
"There was neither sense nor justice in the selection.",
"Fair demand for exchange.",
"Now, small boys, get out of the way!",
"The doctors could make nothing of him.",
"Remained at the camp to rest the party.",
"Remained at the camp.",
"Gives a piece of advice to married women.",
"She came to ask me how I liked my apartment, and to wish me good rest.",
"If violence were intended, he would not stay for the night.",
"And suppose he be?",
"Yes, I suppose I am an old soul too.",
"The window was open.",
"Then he suddenly ran out into the street.",
"He was walking along with his head up.",
"Suppose I had not come until after dark.",
"Much happened before she returned, and much happened after.",
"But it was no use, and at last they came back to the window.",
"One whole side of it was open to the sea.",
"And so the girls had remained.",
"Black was not aware of it.",
"That was what the doctors said when they were sent for.",
"She thought she would fast until she had done what she intended to do.",
"He was a doctor, she discovered.",
"Never trust one of them.",
"I am not for boys!",
"A sign he will not lose this in the west.",
"What skills that?",
"He returned home, but not to sleep.",
"The game was in his hands, he believed, and he intended to keep it there.",
"My offer is fair and square.",
"The sea air would cool me.",
"And just imagine what occurred.",
"Price resulted from her letter.",
"Then suddenly all the weight of my body seemed to fall upon my head.",
"It was well I returned quickly.",
"He had not intended to.",
"He felt that he needed a drink.",
"But not too stupid.",
"Have one on me, boys.",
"Without a word he returned to the house.",
"Another followed, walking forward.",
"No one asked him to drink.",
"Got turned around in the dark, I suppose.",
"At least she thought he was walking about.",
"He looked suddenly very old.",
"Then he asked her where she lived, and she said far away by the sea.",
"But whether it is nature or not, little boys can help it, and must help it.",
"Good advice.",
"He had kept none of the blood money for drink!",
"Yet we have discovered nothing.",
"I was certain to be discovered.",
"He tells me nothing.",
"Yet he tells me nothing.",
"But no, he tells to me nothing.",
"I gave him much to watch and to imagine that he had discovered.",
"Yet nobody tells them.",
"But he was their friend, and would see justice done them.",
"Towards the south.",
"Some stay at home to receive visitors.",
"They must have come down in the world rather suddenly.",
"Why should it have been removed?",
"Some suppose that he did not live at all.",
"He himself was a teacher.",
"It was his mission to separate truth from error.",
"And yet there is nothing very ancient about them.",
"Only one real drink in the world.",
"Their construction.",
"Its importance.",
"Importance of other society.",
"Importance of seeing.",
"What shall we drink?",
"Dress of boys.",
"I begin with that of boys.",
"Treatment of children compared with that of domestic animals.",
"When this is not the case, something can be placed before the window to break the current, so that it need not fall directly upon the child.",
"Do we find a corresponding change in the internal structure?",
"Suppose it should not be done enough!",
"Running to the window, he opened it, and put out his head.",
"A quarter past.",
"Justice was not always to be found on the side of right.",
"Nor is it of very ancient date.",
"I suppose he was himself highly affected with the sound of these words.",
"But it had never before occurred in my case, to leave her by herself and remain out all night.",
"He was aware of that.",
"Winter and summer there was enough for the little feet and hands to do.",
"No visitors called.",
"They would assume, of course, that it was money.",
"This fact is of importance.",
"Doctor, give me a drink!",
"What I cannot feel now, am I to suppose that I shall feel?",
"In their eyes everything was a machine of some sort or other.",
"I am too stupid.",
"It will not do to suppose it.",
"Time passed away, and with it the average share of changing events.",
"The other station could be located as far away as a light could be seen.",
"Finally it occurred to me that I would like to get into the business, somehow.",
"The location was beautiful.",
"Every eye was fixed upon him.",
"Another event occurred this year of which mention should be made in this connection.",
"He knew it was the boys.",
"So the boys took it up.",
"He knew that the other boys would miss him, but he did not care.",
"Nor is there any evidence that he enjoyed the confidence of the community where he lived.",
"We soon learned to keep away from the cities at night.",
"What, holding back?",
"They are fixed to no spot.",
"To stand here like a criminal!",
"The count had turned away toward the window.",
"It is only the boys who do not fear her.",
"I had intended coming.",
"Take advice.",
"I want no advice.",
"The contract has been signed in my presence.",
"She who had believed that nothing was left but to die, was suddenly called upon to live!",
"But, can she trust him?",
"A quarter of a hour passed, and still no sign of that dear man.",
"Love is the greatest thing in the world.",
"This event was of the greatest importance.",
"However, after they had all been helped, it was suddenly observed that one of them would not begin to eat.",
"But, as I left here, so I have returned.",
"It is well worth walking round this, if only for the view.",
"It never so much as occurred to her to mind being caught at this work.",
"I do not know what the one I give is intended to represent.",
"Visitors must not go away without giving up the key of their room.",
"But all the doctors are good.",
"Critics failed to do them justice.",
"This the stupid world, even after years, had never more than half discovered.",
"He picked it up and opened it.",
"The voice was that of my brother and seemed to come from the street outside my window.",
"All were now standing.",
"The great agent in this development of life has been competition.",
"He was fixed even in his dress.",
"He fell in love with himself, married himself, and soon after discovered that he did not know who his wife was.",
"There had come a time to her when she had suddenly opened.",
"He made as if he would go to meet her, but he stopped, returned, and remained standing.",
"It was a few days before the end of the quarter.",
"He had placed himself with his back to the light.",
"I had followed the sea a bit.",
"But put the money into the construction.",
"No sea could ever come over it.",
"But there is what may be called the send of the sea.",
"He gave me advice, much of it.",
"The doctors had given him up.",
"But nothing resulted.",
"Big sea.",
"And why did he murder him?",
"If every one of them were to be written, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.",
"And standing outside they sent to him, and called him.",
"Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?",
"The house was always somewhat dark, and there were no domestic sounds.",
"I wanted a drink of water.",
"He returned to them a similar look.",
"But in the end, in me, he found the greatest love of all, which is the love of woman.",
"He removed a few of the books, and I removed the others.",
"I began to think of something else, but in about a quarter of an hour I looked round and found he was not behind me.",
"I have been alone in the library from morning to night every day.",
"It is almost as important that what is said should be relevant as that it should be true.",
"Justice is not often done to him.",
"Love is given and love is returned.",
"May I look at something which will do for walking?",
"He remained standing until the child had gone.",
"My love has remained with me.",
"The human machine is what interests me most.",
"At the time there was not even a domestic animal in the field.",
"I trust she will not see me.",
"It skills not to go through the past.",
"One day I trust to see it.",
"She was looking out of window.",
"I do not suppose my doctor knows any least thing about it.",
"However I must, I suppose, write.",
"Now for the pictures.",
"And both she and I may like it more than we suppose.",
"But it has occurred to me.",
"There is nothing like being at sea, after all.",
"I am aware I had intended to pay back to my capital some of this.",
"The essential part of work is not an act, it is a state.",
"I wonder how my mother is going to stand the winter.",
"I tried standing by and looking on, and it became too much for me.",
"The other lines are not so ancient.",
"The sea.",
"I, pro.",
"To live, to exist.",
"To change, exchange.",
"Trust, credit.",
"To drink.",
"Justice of the peace.",
"House of a justice of the peace.",
"To exchange.",
"In winter they made not half so much.",
"The greatest speak nothing.",
"All these people were making their way towards a single point.",
"But while so doing I should have known that my action would not prevent the murder.",
"He had a watch and a chain.",
"In one apartment lived an old man and his old woman.",
"I did not understand that such a man can only be helped by changing his views of the world.",
"A drop in the sea!",
"I enjoyed every hour of the day.",
"This room never contains a window.",
"It is an essential that the husband provides a house to which to take his wife."],

["This is a question which I have frequently asked myself.",
"What a strange thing it was!",
"It was evening, a week later.",
"It was already afternoon.",
"Once, in the afternoon, and again, later, I went to visit my sister.",
"My search had shown me nothing fresh.",
"Toward evening, I gave up the search, and returned to the house.",
"Indeed, since then, I have made a rule never to speak to her about the strange things, that happen in this great, old house.",
"The thought that had come to me, was confirmed.",
"Then, I knew what it was that made it appear so strange.",
"About this time, there happened a fresh thing.",
"The evening has come, and I am in my study.",
"There is something familiar about the shape of it.",
"Unfortunately the difference of opinion as to the form of government made things very difficult.",
"I could hardly judge of that, as he never talked politics to me.",
"After all, it is more or less a question of balance.",
"Let each compare notes with the other.",
"The first step toward rule is to find a point of view from which one can look widely out over the race.",
"More than this, he risks his life.",
"These things are not in themselves growth, nor its real index.",
"He soon had the hospital in good shape again.",
"Hardly had I made an end of speaking these words, when she moved from the place where she was standing, and came toward me.",
"In these terms ended this strange letter.",
"He did some big things, and had in mind still bigger.",
"And how we did clean her!",
"It was now well along toward spring.",
"The thought had of late dropped into the background.",
"Air quite fresh.",
"A friend of mine, who unfortunately has no voice for song, has a most excellent wife and beautiful baby, and cannot therefore be said to be without music at home.",
"The law has reached its limit.",
"We were entirely successful, for we took one at almost every throw.",
"I have never heard the balance of that story yet.",
"It is hardly possible to present too frequently to the human mind the image of a man who lived only to do good.",
"Spread on the top.",
"Clean the fish.",
"It is so little known, however, that it can hardly be said to have a common name.",
"And this instance is by no means a rare one.",
"The view from here must be extremely beautiful in any weather.",
"Then followed a strange contrast.",
"There was no hypothesis by which she could claim them as her own.",
"How fresh!",
"He was glad to hear this.",
"He will die unless someone comes to his aid.",
"But she has never once sent for me, or given me to understand that she required my aid.",
"I was told that this is the only known example of this truly wonderful work.",
"They could do nothing but thank him and accept his offer.",
"Then, when he was in her arms, she told her story.",
"She said it at lunch today, and I do want to.",
"However, there was no doubt that their parties had got the name for being funny, and that was quite enough.",
"Then came lunch.",
"He was going through a crisis.",
"Why did she go out for the whole afternoon?",
"She was glad she would be absolutely alone.",
"Well, they were linked together.",
"I would rather not meet him this evening.",
"In the afternoon she went to school.",
"They became so heavy she could hardly walk.",
"They had wild parties every day.",
"They thought they were helping him to get well.",
"Many other people came and told her how glad they were that the old ways were changing.",
"They are always fighting.",
"It would be hard for them to give up fighting.",
"There are many things that are strange to me and my people.",
"I am glad for the light.",
"She was glad to go.",
"I was thinking of that, this afternoon.",
"A few days later a very strange thing happened.",
"The disease is not slow in running its course.",
"The last piece of fighting was the worst they had had to face.",
"The church became so full that the people could hardly find room.",
"I just never was so glad.",
"She fell back, regarding her.",
"Department stores that turned from her services almost before they were offered.",
"The evening passed quickly enough.",
"What followed it would be difficult to describe.",
"He was here all right in the early part of the evening.",
"Have it explained to him that it may be a tough job.",
"He never finished this sentence, or his speech.",
"Their actions seemed very strange to me.",
"While they were thus considering, I got between them and our camp.",
"During my absence, my wife had given birth to a son, and he was several weeks old when I returned.",
"He never reached the other bank, but dropped dead in the water.",
"What now happened has never been clearly explained.",
"It answers me.",
"I hardly know myself.",
"Now this is very strange!",
"A few words, however, in explanation.",
"Also, strange as it may seem, a man may be great and yet not be great.",
"It was all so new and strange.",
"His arms never felt the weight.",
"I am glad.",
"They were making the most of their last evening.",
"As he explained it to himself, that gave one a free hand.",
"Mine does not appear in any way, shape or form.",
"I hardly understand the words.",
"He too was glad to see his son so well.",
"There seemed to be nothing to do but to follow his host.",
"It looked almost as if he had turned the corner, and was getting well.",
"The balance of opinion in the camp was against this view.",
"Many strange things grew natural.",
"It was the only possible explanation.",
"Indeed, but she has great need of his service in a very particular manner.",
"The word is extremely rare in this sense and perhaps only found here.",
"A rare use.",
"Glad, indeed!",
"And there she remained for the rest of the evening.",
"And for the usual crime, of course.",
"She was considering the change in him.",
"It had come to her, quite as though she were considering some other woman, that what the man said was, in a fashion, true.",
"And the man made as though to rise, and could not, and his face was very glad.",
"Her other stories are certainly about children, but are, as a rule, written for adults.",
"Children should read books, as adults do, to get something out of them.",
"After putting us across he asked for money, and I gave him half a dollar.",
"Things had now come to a crisis.",
"He had frequently reported home on the need of more men.",
"There was hardly any need to do so.",
"Many parts of the town, including whole streets, look as though the houses had been built since that time.",
"This is especially true of many of the streets near the water front.",
"In a sentence I told her the truth.",
"He had enough to do, and could give me no aid.",
"And the strange thing was that the voice was familiar.",
"They talked for a little while more about this strange thing that had happened.",
"Why was she so slow?",
"Both of the other girls put their arms about her.",
"And then she gave herself up to the strange new scene.",
"The woman raised her head to see who it was who put such a strange question to her.",
"But this woman was not glad.",
"And it was very strange to her to see one who was not content here.",
"Then he led her to the other corner of the room where there were other pictures.",
"Of flight!",
"I went on to the city of the evening light.",
"I got him into my arms to put him back into bed.",
"But the girls were more surprised than it is possible to describe.",
"We placed it there that evening with our own hands.",
"Then I explained to him, so far as I was able, what had happened.",
"It was indeed a mixed kind of a place.",
"And something else was helping.",
"A strange couple they would make, and strange would be their conversation!",
"That was hardly my question.",
"Still he would be glad to be off.",
"Then suddenly it began to slow down.",
"It was not until late in the evening that the cause became known.",
"They are at the last wall of resistance.",
"It was he who got the men out of the prison.",
"Love does not stay put, no matter how hard folks try to keep it put.",
"Now, as they went, evening began to fall.",
"Now on the afternoon of this day.",
"Nice, clean work.",
"Come clean.",
"This afternoon, nothing he did could have surprised her.",
"The strain was telling in other places.",
"The manner in which a thing is done is not important.",
"Got bigger.",
"A strange thing happened then.",
"His face, as she looked up to it, was so changed that she hardly knew him.",
"At first he was for fighting at once.",
"She had not believed half of his explanation.",
"Shot him clean between the eyes.",
"There only remained flight.",
"I was glad to see him, and I think he was glad to see me.",
"He told first of the events of the afternoon, and then passed on to the evening.",
"Nor would the mechanism stay in order so long.",
"He did not come on usually, some one said, until the middle of the afternoon.",
"We can not find for it an explanation.",
"Then again, how did he know so certainly just how the mechanism worked?",
"I want to go up and see the spring where these grow.",
"Then one evening she came suddenly into the machine room.",
"After this the matter dropped.",
"I take a great interest in crazy folks.",
"They are of all kinds, my customers.",
"They were glad to get these to eat.",
"The first white people that came to this country hardly knew how to get their living here.",
"People knew very little about this strange thing with a big name.",
"She got ready to spring on him.",
"He was so happy that he could hardly sleep at all.",
"They ran into the streets.",
"They were so glad, that they could not help it.",
"He learned to skin and stuff them.",
"He knew that his father was in debt.",
"Then he fixed another so that the first one would throw the light on this one.",
"Evening came.",
"Describe the looks of the house.",
"Or they may be related by marriage.",
"But we must make an explanation first.",
"One matter, however, should be explained.",
"Well, hardly!",
"The strange thing was, one did not note if she were beautiful or not.",
"We want fresh thought and modern methods.",
"She was not allowed to go in, and when evening came she knew she could not sleep.",
"So do leaves.",
"This is the history of my finding a score or more of rare plants, which I could name.",
"It was no time for explanation.",
"A strange peace came to the girl.",
"But this is perhaps all that can be said in its favor.",
"The work of which we are writing answers these requirements well.",
"When did marriage ever reform a bad man?",
"I ran to meet and aid her.",
"In a moment she was in the streets again.",
"Age and date of birth.",
"This they had done and had been glad of the rest.",
"He dropped something.",
"This was explained to the men.",
"Something dropped through the air.",
"I hardly knew him.",
"But this, apparently, is the explanation.",
"The only thing he took any interest in was the evening papers.",
"Let us accept it for the moment as absolutely true.",
"I think she would agree to that proposal.",
"This is no common case of violence and the parties to it are not of the common order.",
"I was willing to accept my release in this way.",
"Either hypothesis brought light.",
"Another strange thing!",
"When she did, her voice was strange, though what she said was very simple.",
"Should I find the law in shape to deal with it?",
"And so the afternoon passed.",
"It was a cold night, as I have said, and there were but few people in the streets.",
"A strange look had come into his face.",
"He wanted something bigger.",
"Down there it was new, and strange, and without men.",
"Little by little she dropped back.",
"He, too, was glad to get back to their old home.",
"My song spread wide.",
"During the night his friend went to the spring.",
"She received them with open arms.",
"How the day passed I hardly know.",
"It would have been strange indeed had our people been able to hold anything like a military formation.",
"But think what folks would say!",
"Their shape or figure.",
"The simple explanation is that which I have given above.",
"Yes, I think that corner will do.",
"Another strange thing was, that in the further wall was a door which was new to him.",
"What a marriage of words!",
"He had been from home all day, as he frequently was of late, only he did not usually return so early in the evening.",
"He dropped his hands and turned away into the house.",
"Can I describe her as I close my eyes and see her again before me?",
"I know many a general who would have been glad to do so well.",
"And yet, how strange it is!",
"How shall I describe it?",
"He has no interest in fighting, and he does not want to fight.",
"The first method hardly needs discussion here.",
"They went away and came back again in the afternoon.",
"What is the moral of this story?",
"Nothing so strange has ever happened!",
"The afternoon passed, and yet we were not successful.",
"But no aid came.",
"Otherwise the thing was hardly worth doing.",
"In mind and manner he was older than his years, and he knew his work as a military professional extremely well.",
"Things were rather active that evening.",
"It was this which had caused the block.",
"We had to fire hard most of the day, especially in the afternoon and evening.",
"The fighting was over!",
"He knew as well as I there was no reason why I should be glad to see him.",
"I started to speak, but he raised his voice, and for the second time that evening became entirely serious.",
"For days at a time, I have hardly heard him say a word.",
"The floor had not been clean.",
"And then a strange thing happened.",
"The evening was quite too much for him.",
"I proposed marriage.",
"For instance, he neither held nor would accept any public office.",
"The police must do their work without fear or favor.",
"But folks would always look on it as natural enough.",
"Back to the hotel?",
"Both her arms were round him.",
"His letters to his mother had been very rare and short.",
"The spring was now coming on.",
"He leaves men to themselves to get through life as they can.",
"And is not the answer the most essential of all answers?",
"Does that seem strange?",
"The tree gave birth to everything else that lives.",
"Unfortunately he did not allow me.",
"All who carried arms remained at home.",
"He had hardly expected anything different.",
"Then he dropped his eyes again to the table.",
"The fresh air would be just the thing for her.",
"But his next speech showed he had been considering her words.",
"She says, poor thing, she is glad she is come home to die with me.",
"These are becoming fewer, however, from day to day.",
"In the course of our conversation I found that the old man read the papers frequently, and that he was a man of more than common information in his class.",
"And, indeed, it truly was!",
"And in good shape.",
"He liked this time of the year almost as much as he liked spring.",
"So there the matter dropped.",
"The spring came at last.",
"The host again moved on.",
"To arms!",
"There was no fighting on either side.",
"The result of this would be the formation of new species.",
"There is no doubt that she was a distinct moral power for good.",
"My not being able to read them very well probably made them appear more strange and out of the way to me.",
"Or was he only very glad?",
"What shall we compare her to?",
"Happy the woman who is, and rare.",
"It was a very hot evening.",
"It is slow.",
"Therefore we must accept.",
"In a few words he explained the situation.",
"He never finished the sentence.",
"We only know that it never leaves us as it found us.",
"He did not press all his points home in the manner of one speaking from his own brain.",
"At last the evening came to an end.",
"It would have been very strange if he had not called.",
"Truly our ways were separate.",
"From the last of them the boy came away with a new light on his face and a new spring in his step.",
"But I feel more like making a clean, new start, in a new place.",
"My folks have some money they want to put into a safe place.",
"It was one of the rare times when they did not see eye to eye.",
"They take greater moral risks for it than they do for money.",
"But he started these folks thinking the right way.",
"And the town was glad to see him.",
"More than that, all the world was becoming increasingly related to the life of every part.",
"He had not dropped it in the streets.",
"Strain it off, and put by for use.",
"If there is no ice, spring water will answer the same purpose, but will require to be more frequently changed.",
"The other side must be done in the same manner.",
"This usually takes place in the spring.",
"The great thing is to keep the affected surface of the skin from the contact of the air.",
"Fresh eyes look upon the world, and it is changed.",
"Indeed he almost allows as much.",
"When all the work was done in the evening, all the family usually played a game together.",
"What forces will shape their growth?",
"The good news had spread.",
"To arms then, and still to arms!",
"All was truly well on board.",
"Does he wish to send money back to the folks at home?",
"I had not thought to come this way, but I am glad that I did so.",
"Here they all stopped to take a more distinct view of a place that had so much interest with most of the party.",
"He did, though it was not the door, but his arms.",
"No helping it.",
"When this was done he made up the fire, and went back to his work, sitting at the corner of the table, having the fire to his left.",
"That is the light that is most useful to us poor folks.",
"The first is easily explained.",
"Everyone was fighting or thinking of fighting.",
"This statement requires some explanation.",
"They are not fighting, they say, for us.",
"But I know that it is worth fighting to the end, whatever it may cost to all and each of us.",
"It can hardly have been for lack of models.",
"What a loss it would have been to the world if he had explained them away!",
"Without regarding private ends.",
"The woman was given in marriage by her husband himself, as some father might do.",
"I was glad to hear and see things, of course.",
"But now things seemed to be all mixed up.",
"That same explanation was the only one that ever occurred to me, even in the first night.",
"The wife parts with something by the very fact of marriage.",
"Do not think hardly of them for this.",
"Force cannot act where there is no resistance.",
"A few words explained all that was necessary.",
"A note of ended strain was significant in his voice.",
"All these strange men!",
"Some of them hard customers!",
"I can hardly realize it.",
"I know tough customers when I see them.",
"Our debt will be paid.",
"He bought up my debt.",
"Men passed in and out of the hotel.",
"If they accept work it is for a chance to do damage.",
"His men were very slow in finding any.",
"It was evening.",
"All was explained in that.",
"How strange!",
"How glad she would be to see him!",
"Yet how glad that made her.",
"There was no more fighting.",
"He had, it seemed, a debt that he must pay.",
"How strange the choice that had been given her!",
"The action was not slow.",
"But she did not make much resistance.",
"This day, when we met them, they got fresh, and of course I had to start something.",
"I can hardly read at all.",
"But that was not fighting.",
"A few, to right and left, dropped near the front line.",
"It changed shape.",
"He was glad.",
"Throughout the spring area the plants have a good start and are in excellent condition.",
"I found it true, for I paid one dollar for going a few steps only.",
"One evening we made up a story.",
"I would aid the mother and not the daughter.",
"I went to work the same evening.",
"In the evening about half was made up of men.",
"But strange enough no one so much as mentioned the girl in connection with either man.",
"They had to carry out an attack there, which probably meant more fighting.",
"His life is in the balance.",
"An hour passed by in this manner.",
"Outside, all seemed as usual.",
"It was clean out there.",
"Same as folks?",
"The evening was anything but that to which he had looked forward.",
"He put his arms about her, thinking that she was going to fall.",
"She told herself, when he had gone, that she was glad to be alone.",
"Her eyes opened widely.",
"He began a slow search.",
"She saw again the strange look in his eyes.",
"He hardly heard her.",
"He followed, his arms out.",
"Now she was almost glad that this had happened.",
"Not the law, but the land sets the limit.",
"All this requires explanation.",
"But as it really happened to them they knew that it was true, no matter how strange it was.",
"The children were glad to come out.",
"He was so glad that he did not know whom to love first, nor how much.",
"Whatever will become of her when she leaves home.",
"Fighting is bad work.",
"Some of them are strange to me now.",
"His manner was full of importance.",
"Being away so much, the manner of living does not mean so much to him as to her, for she is always here.",
"That she would not tell anything about herself, could only have one explanation!",
"He was as glad to get me, as I was to find a home.",
"I ran away and got married, and then I ran away from marriage to keep my boy.",
"But he could hardly keep from asking her.",
"His manner indicated that it was a long story.",
"This was the afternoon of the same day.",
"Strong explained to him.",
"How glad I was!",
"When he was growing, he hardly ever got enough to eat.",
"How glad I was to be in the country!",
"Every place she took us to was as clean as possible.",
"He was glad to see me, and followed me home.",
"Whatever it is, they eat it up clean.",
"They are most sensitive animals.",
"How glad the animals were to see him!",
"It was the hotel.",
"I knew he was only waiting for the spring to leave us, and I was not sorry.",
"But a strange thing followed.",
"She had almost no revenue, and now and then a piece had to go.",
"But we hardly give the event its right name.",
"Her manner was wild.",
"I can hardly say.",
"No explanation was considered necessary.",
"But I am glad of it.",
"Now how is this to be explained?",
"Strange, but true.",
"Strange it all is, yet true.",
"Much remains to be learned about them and the manner of their control.",
"In the evening he is all in.",
"Growth is a strain.",
"Modern knowledge cannot accept all this as a whole.",
"In this way they passed the balance of the night, nor would either of them soon forget the experience, though from different reasons.",
"And so, one afternoon, a party of very interested people went over to look at it.",
"And are we never to have lunch?",
"Back this evening.",
"I doubt if any sort of social order will really be able to stand the strain of a fully worked out modern war.",
"It is a sentence one can read over several times.",
"He has no power of intervention at all.",
"He therefore took to flight.",
"Strange, is it not?",
"Good night, that kid was the limit!",
"Just a strain.",
"A pretty story truly.",
"So he decided upon remaining out in the open air for the present.",
"But when the afternoon was half spent, it suddenly occurred to her that if she did not go home she should die.",
"The children thought this a strange answer.",
"More debt.",
"Debt and debt and debt.",
"Last evening.",
"He seemed ready to spring up and fire.",
"He cut the sentence short.",
"I think I have received such answers myself.",
"Was he glad or sorry?",
"He did not seem sure, either, whether to be glad or sorry.",
"How short the evening was!",
"This afternoon she was as happy as she wanted to be.",
"Taking her into her arms she told her all she knew.",
"Before she ended, the child was a dead weight in her arms.",
"All of the boys wrote letters to the girls and received answers in return.",
"Everything was so new and strange to them that they did not feel at all at home.",
"They also grew serious at times, talking of home and their folks.",
"And if man takes up with a wrong answer to that question, then the man himself is certain to go wrong in all manner of ways.",
"There is no manner of doubt of it.",
"Then followed a strange conversation.",
"As a rule he was always back before the coming of evening.",
"This one had been made before, and not by, her marriage.",
"Truly not?",
"But hardly little, or stupid.",
"Before the corner house it stopped.",
"He also was in evening dress.",
"Let him take in all the fresh air he can.",
"Such was the usual practice!",
"We who are so clean!",
"But they hardly require it.",
"Why then, leave word with some of his folks.",
"What manner of man was a?",
"Bigger than I?",
"Why, this is strange.",
"I long to see their birth.",
"It requires no explanation.",
"Very strange.",
"That was very well for them, but the boys hardly felt the same way about it.",
"Constant practice.",
"The children on the streets know the name, make, and model of nearly all the cars produced.",
"He turns up in the evening and does not always remain there.",
"Arms, and especially money to buy them with, were hard to get.",
"Regarding the assessment of the additional tax not much need be said in the way of explanation.",
"All through the day came in fresh news of further attacks all along the line.",
"And perhaps that was the only explanation of it.",
"And in a moment her manner changed.",
"I can see through the leaves.",
"I am so glad, because it gets me away from school.",
"She was not particularly glad or surprised.",
"He did not seem to want any explanation.",
"An explanation does not improve by keeping.",
"I think I heard he did not do quite so well by himself, as he had done by the old folks.",
"They will throw out a random word in or out of season, and be content to let it pass for what it is worth.",
"He is not in the scale of comparison.",
"No corner of a street is complete without them.",
"There are things in that shape which I cannot allow for such.",
"There is nothing strange nor new in it.",
"It has hardly felt that it is a body.",
"No one knew whether to take their leaves or stay.",
"But it is possible to be more sensitive for others than they are for themselves.",
"They have no dinner parties.",
"If any man living can describe the scene we looked upon it is himself, and I trust he will do it.",
"The company at the hotel changed almost every day.",
"I would stay there until lunch time, a regular hands on, doing whatever I was asked to do.",
"I left in the evening for the hotel.",
"Continued writing my report in the evening.",
"I am sorry, that the remaining part of this letter is not equal to the first.",
"The effects of these contributions may, perhaps, reach still further.",
"Yes, we are very glad.",
"In the evening I came to him again.",
"It had dropped out of my mind.",
"I should be glad to come.",
"I believe I said, I was very glad to have met with it.",
"I shall be glad to see her again.",
"Is not this strange weather?",
"This indeed I should be glad to hear if I could once believe it.",
"We spent the day and evening at his house.",
"I am never strange in a strange place.",
"I was glad enough to help him.",
"He was so glad.",
"What was my own poor opinion at a crisis like this?",
"But for court influence it would have gone hardly with my friend.",
"And if this beginning is now with us, by what reason can we limit it?",
"It may have been that they were far from home, and I seemed a friend in a very strange land.",
"Still the day passed on as usual.",
"No explanation had taken place between them, however.",
"His marriage could add nothing to the distance between them.",
"People do not see the strange things which pass them every day.",
"They said no more to each other that evening.",
"I will not be thus in debt to him, even for his love.",
"Why did she almost spring after him?",
"Take me to the fresh air!",
"It was that strange man again.",
"It is hardly possible to state the claim more fairly than has been done.",
"Training in arms for the present is out of the question.",
"Both parties, therefore, decided to live in peace.",
"Government aid is therefore no solution.",
"I accept it too.",
"It is widely read.",
"But he has gone about it in the wrong manner.",
"One might as well attempt to read a history of the world in a single evening.",
"He had heard of me, and came to see what manner of man I was.",
"It is not easy to describe the interest which this scene presented.",
"He and his wife called upon us in our hotel.",
"We were glad of an opportunity to answer her questions.",
"Also a large class of adults.",
"I have a still further favor to ask.",
"I do the fighting.",
"But little explanation of these events is necessary.",
"The shape of her head, however, was good.",
"The risks were many.",
"She even seemed, in a measure, glad to see him.",
"Suddenly the strain passed.",
"There was something a little new in her manner.",
"I remember nothing, absolutely nothing, which happened before this evening.",
"I have just discovered that my hotel is quite close by here.",
"He knew that we spent last evening together as old friends.",
"He took her suddenly into his arms.",
"Then followed the wonderful evening.",
"We were married this afternoon.",
"He was looking at her now with a strange light in his eyes.",
"I had no right to speak as I did in the store this evening.",
"We explained what we wanted.",
"And, of course, the pictures of her folks is inside.",
"However, our host explained that we took all the risk.",
"He had intended to throw it away as soon as he found himself outside.",
"And her shape!",
"And we shall put out the usual notice.",
"He got hold of a block of paper and began to write.",
"The answer was slow in coming.",
"Why did she want to go and get things all mixed up like this?",
"But at that he would be glad to have it over.",
"His head dropped.",
"The stores were open.",
"The head dropped back.",
"The sentence was not finished.",
"Unfortunately, the end of this one is not equal to the beginning.",
"There could hardly be a greater contrast.",
"Why so glad?",
"Still it is interesting to compare them.",
"Call it a hypothesis, and experiment upon it.",
"He knew he was on the return trip and he was glad to travel.",
"There is in them a note of wild, strange music.",
"A pretty question, truly.",
"I shall win what I am fighting for.",
"How strange a thing this love was, that it should change a man so!",
"He raised her in his arms until her face was against his.",
"And he was walking in his sleep again the other evening.",
"And if she has seen us, I am rather glad.",
"As he was leaving the room his father took a letter from the table, held it up and dropped it.",
"That could be the only explanation.",
"How strange, how wonderful!",
"She confirmed the story.",
"Sign me an order and I will go at once and call them to arms.",
"Of what kind of resistance?",
"The meeting did not call the people to arms.",
"In one of the streets through which they went a window was opened.",
"They received them that evening.",
"As I turned the corner of the street a man passed close by me.",
"All was explained.",
"They had no arms.",
"We had not seen him since the previous evening.",
"Truly excellent.",
"It was done in this manner.",
"To prison!",
"The streets were dark.",
"Strange place.",
"He even offered resistance to the police.",
"Having the arms, they had the men.",
"We hardly know.",
"That which she held in her arms was a dead child.",
"Fighting had been going on there throughout the day.",
"There had been fighting there during the morning.",
"No means of flight.",
"At one moment the scale turned on their side.",
"It allows years to pass by, and at the moment when men are least thinking of it, it appears.",
"Increase our stores.",
"There is of course a great debt due to them.",
"These are totally distinct from those either in the first or in the last of the cases which have been mentioned.",
"The terms therefore appeared to be open to all who would accept them.",
"For a long time there was hardly a lawyer in the land.",
"Not strange, so far as kind will give me leave.",
"What manner of thing was it?",
"And to this law there is no limit.",
"In a conversation I had with him about a year ago, he told me he was writing another book which would throw further light on the subject, but a few months later he passed over before it was presented to the world.",
"The mechanism of it was simple.",
"His calls in the evening were made early and ended early.",
"I dropped into the way of being at home a little more.",
"The other man was to call that evening, and he came.",
"I have read somewhere that there is a moral to the life of every man.",
"The son explained.",
"The account may aid the doctors, though.",
"There was no school that afternoon.",
"Unfortunately, he could not take her on any conditions.",
"Then another strange thing happened.",
"The history of this case is extremely simple.",
"All this was, of course, against the prison rules.",
"I then gave both parties a little advice.",
"I am not of the right sex to describe it.",
"Then came last spring and the end of hope.",
"What are the things worth fighting for?",
"I explained it all to the judge.",
"The scene about him was one of constant activity.",
"He hardly knew what to do next, but he kept his eyes open.",
"I followed him back to the hotel.",
"So he would have married my daughter, would he, even though I did keep a hotel!",
"Many men, who might not fear death, might yet not choose to meet it in that shape.",
"This is not a thing done in a corner.",
"So much for that hypothesis.",
"She did not appear to note his changed manner.",
"She had a strange face sometimes.",
"He suddenly reached out, took her in his arms.",
"I am doing her a great favor.",
"Suddenly he dropped her hand.",
"The method is extremely simple.",
"What manner of girl was she?",
"What would come of their flight?",
"No attempt had been made to cover the flight.",
"None the less he was glad on her account.",
"My pay is increased to one dollar and a quarter a day.",
"The procedure suggested is at least as necessary when considering the question of training as it is in the case of operations.",
"I have a proposal to make.",
"But the strain was over for me.",
"For a moment we can forget everything else, even if it were death itself waiting just round the corner.",
"I was glad to know that, though it surprised me.",
"And I must do this without first going back to the hotel, as it might be very difficult to get away again, once I was there.",
"Also I asked to see an evening paper.",
"I had thought that questions had been asked and answers given which might mean everything to me, if I could only have heard them.",
"The subject was dropped there.",
"But on my return, in the following spring, it was very obvious.",
"The business was secondary to the style in which it should be performed.",
"The man will break down under the strain.",
"They were almost confirmed a moment later.",
"And what their limit may be I think we never shall know.",
"But that hypothesis will not stand.",
"Many answers have been given to that question.",
"She asked for no explanation.",
"There was no other letter, and she carried that one letter in her hand all through the streets.",
"But she knew hardly more than they.",
"He could hardly taste it.",
"Well, then I got a little something, same as other folks.",
"They explained it again.",
"It was rare that she had any one to help her.",
"The letters were to his mother, but sent in care of the white folks.",
"In like manner the clothes for summer use were made in winter.",
"On the following morning I went for the mail as usual, but there was nothing new.",
"There was to be a general break up of the old home, and the beginning of a new manner of life.",
"It was sad to see the changes that had come to the white folks.",
"A strange order it was!",
"So it was, also, in the present crisis.",
"We shall never meet in arms, however, if I can prevent it.",
"He seemed to think it no less wrong than strange.",
"Good evening!",
"There was no more chance for explanation.",
"And it was so beautiful today, how beautiful the running about this evening after school would be!",
"So it happened this evening.",
"But almost every evening the same thing occurred as on the first.",
"The same evening my daughter asked me, whether I could ever in my life change my opinion.",
"Some folks does.",
"He thought he might try a small piece and, having tried, was willing to make the attempt on a larger scale.",
"Mostly, folks as has them would be glad to go long before they are took.",
"After all, we had lunch together once!",
"Strange, that I cannot understand my own case as I understand the cases of others.",
"I hardly know why I like the place.",
"But they do say that her side of it is easy explained.",
"They asked all kinds of questions, and never believed a word of the answers.",
"They have strange ideas.",
"It was like a new birth.",
"He was watching me this morning and went off as fast as he knew how, to spread the news.",
"Her host was already moving toward the door.",
"Did she, too, feel strange?",
"No, it could hardly be that.",
"I hardly knew it myself, then, but now I am sure.",
"I saw him going past this very afternoon.",
"It was later than usual.",
"He knew that all day he had been fighting back that question.",
"She offered no word of explanation nor did any need of one occur to him.",
"Every one is strange.",
"Could hardly believe it.",
"She could not see through winter into spring.",
"It came on the afternoon mail.",
"She saw clearly a plan, a beautiful, simple plan to prevent the marriage.",
"It is spring!",
"Perhaps it was the spring in his case also.",
"And when we went out it was usually in the evening.",
"Unfortunately she has changed her mind.",
"Why, I hardly looked at the man.",
"That alone would throw him out of court.",
"I kept thinking things over all the morning, and half the afternoon.",
"It would have taken very little to turn the scale.",
"Of course the answers are obvious.",
"Let us consider her moral right under either of these points.",
"I learned of this decision the same evening.",
"Justice is secondary.",
"Unfortunately I had come too late in the season.",
"The skin, although small, was the most beautiful I have ever killed.",
"In the afternoon we decided to watch a new place.",
"It was well on in the afternoon when we started back to camp.",
"It was therefore late that afternoon when we reached our new camp.",
"Unfortunately it has become the fashion.",
"There were no answers.",
"It was the crisis of the fight.",
"Strange heart of man!",
"That is strange.",
"He thought it was very strange.",
"He was alone in a strange city, without money or friends.",
"He was glad to be at home again and able to work.",
"She could not be glad enough that the trial, now so nearly to its close, would result in giving to her a son.",
"It was strange but it was very true.",
"But the work was new and strange to him.",
"For some reason it seemed longer than usual this night.",
"Indeed, after that he had very frequently to stop and rest.",
"He was glad of that too.",
"It was hardly possible, they wrote, that the boy could still be living.",
"Decrease of learning.",
"Every island a prison.",
"Such boys may do good at a private school, where constant attention is paid to them, and they are watched.",
"The sentence was to this purpose.",
"Our evening was passed as last night was.",
"There are few of them now remaining.",
"I would never have any man sell land, to throw money into the funds, as is often done, or to try any other species of trade.",
"I am glad I have seen it once.",
"It is really rather a sad little story, because he died of heart disease very soon after the marriage.",
"Or for the matter of that, to accept him?",
"Of course the living skin can be examined only in a general way.",
"The mechanism by which it does this has not yet been clearly explained.",
"The eyes of children need more care than those of adults, because their eyes are still in the course of development.",
"It is an extremely beautiful experiment, and one that can easily be made.",
"The first and essential thing to do is to give fresh air.",
"And as they had a fresh one at every stage, there was no time to win him to their purpose.",
"I do not think my arms could reach round it.",
"I sent him to prison.",
"The news soon spread.",
"But it was told that he had used strange words.",
"But I bring birth and I give life.",
"I would be glad at my heart to be out of his reach.",
"I should be glad to have a father who would own me!",
"All the morning extremely happy.",
"I am glad I know that.",
"I must move slow, in order to be sure.",
"I am glad at my heart that it came before we entirely make up.",
"The child was strange in a very different way from her mother.",
"Things were strange.",
"They played hard all the afternoon.",
"That is why they did not know her at first, that and her very strange clothes.",
"Finally he had to strain his eyes to see it at all.",
"And it was like spring coming into winter.",
"Spring had come!",
"We must get the house clean and ready for her.",
"All the afternoon the children played up and down the beach.",
"But how strange were the people!",
"And a strange thing happened to him in that second, the second he caught her hair.",
"Then she picked him up in her arms and started to run with him, as if she would throw him into the well.",
"He hardly knew, any of the time, whether that strange wild woman could be his mother, only they told him she was.",
"There was much talk that afternoon of the coming trip.",
"And for once the girls were glad of his services.",
"She hardly knew what to do next.",
"There was much talk, of which the girls caught some, and then the explanation came.",
"For it was getting late and the girls did not feel like spending the night in some strange place.",
"A strange look came over his face.",
"Then, early in the morning, they started for home on the last stage of their tour.",
"It was rather strange that she never thought of calling for help, but she did not.",
"Glad of it!",
"If we agree, then back me soon with aid.",
"What, is there none that answers?",
"I am glad of it.",
"The word is frequently to be found in ancient writers.",
"I hold that such a man has no moral right to continue in business.",
"Come to the hotel!",
"My first visit to the country ended in a sad event, which was to shape the whole course of my life.",
"So man leaves home and family.",
"But nothing happened that evening.",
"I can hardly get her to speak.",
"What if it were true what the strange old man had said?",
"Still, this skin!",
"These fish pass never from their corner to another.",
"The features did not balance.",
"Lots of folks do business that way.",
"The light from the hotel window fell on the right hand.",
"In fact, he made hardly any.",
"But there was no aid for him in that quarter.",
"It was a different formation.",
"He could hardly think straight.",
"And they were fewer still.",
"Now, was not that strange?",
"Did I ask to be brought here into the prison?",
"They did as I told them, and were glad to do it.",
"When he killed himself, I was glad.",
"He was a clean, beautiful boy.",
"But what to me were risks?",
"In the eyes of the little world of the hotel nothing had been changed.",
"He knew not that he was under watch, but he took not risks.",
"In this strange way we are made.",
"But what was the explanation?",
"So I thought of having a cold spread and getting the things in from outside.",
"What is the explanation?",
"Hardly any.",
"Now that the explanation was given, how obvious it was!",
"This was that the missing man had been made away with by one of the parties mentioned in the report.",
"It seemed to me that there must be some other explanation.",
"But was there any other explanation?",
"Strange to say, it is most common in large families and among those who pass for friends.",
"In this combination the past and the present are linked.",
"Adults, even, generally drink to cool themselves.",
"Let it be slow and natural.",
"Moral reasons for having children sleep alone.",
"It should also be kept clean.",
"Cold water at birth.",
"Still I think these are rare cases.",
"Most of my readers may have heard how they read, but I will describe the process as well as I can.",
"He caught his daughter and her child in his arms.",
"I am truly sorry to hear it.",
"May that be truly said of us, and all of us!",
"Accept my help.",
"There was no other like it in any of the stores, and she had turned all of them inside out.",
"She had no moral sense.",
"The leading spring of life was money.",
"In which words, all these strange things were found out.",
"I had just life enough remaining.",
"They felt that something, they hardly knew what, was about to take place.",
"I can hardly believe there are any such men.",
"One thinks well of it, as of most things fresh from his mind.",
"Yes, we are fighting at last, it appears.",
"Him I need not describe.",
"My favorite one I must describe.",
"This is something out of the usual course.",
"Some one has said, that it makes a great difference in the force of a sentence whether or not there is a man behind it.",
"History is hardly the same study that it once was.",
"After my father died, a great many folks came to the house, and they sold everything.",
"He dropped the words to try the group.",
"There was a show of resistance.",
"I will not run in debt, if I lose the whole matter.",
"Hardly any of these were making any money, though the service was poor and the rates were high.",
"I would have been glad to work for nothing.",
"Another strange thing was discovered.",
"At the close of the services, the table was spread for dinner.",
"In a moment more, the meeting had passed the crisis.",
"Here the services were held during the balance of the year.",
"To test the matter, I opened an evening service.",
"The business must now be done in a strange language, and in the method of the red man.",
"Human nature is a very strange combination, and it must be taken as it is.",
"He was glad when the day ended and he could go home.",
"I started that evening.",
"It is all in the manner of driving.",
"In the afternoon and evening I sit in the study with him.",
"He knew his friends and family, but thought he was in a strange house.",
"Who is to hold the scale and decide?",
"It was slow going.",
"But these last words are in a wrong strain.",
"If a marriage were really in question, what could be more serious?",
"How can I describe his features?",
"It dropped to his side.",
"But he began to think that the explanation had gone too far.",
"Her soul is as rare as her person.",
"No good will come of this marriage.",
"His head had dropped upon his breast.",
"The old man said truly.",
"The marriage must take place.",
"I am glad of that.",
"He spread it out open on the table.",
"More like a death than a marriage!",
"What could this strange man have to say to him?",
"Could it stand the strain?",
"We have all seen such folks.",
"But strange, strange thing!",
"How shall I describe him?",
"The past was too slow, and the future will be much too fast.",
"The part of the original church which still remains is perhaps the wall, which forms the western limit of the present church.",
"I helped myself, and the matter dropped.",
"Be the folks at home?",
"Who can take a walk in our streets and not think?",
"I thought he seemed rather glad to go on with his story.",
"In point of fact, the name was as strange to me as the man.",
"Then, as I should have expected, I got no further answers.",
"I can hardly describe it.",
"No wonder, considering what we have gone through.",
"How strange it is that such a question should be so put!",
"She went out again late in the evening.",
"I am glad my husband has had company.",
"How he watched for that birth!",
"But these men who came to meet us were clean men.",
"Natural selection, however, gives the explanation.",
"Talk of fighting fire with fire!",
"At the same time, it then, if ever, truly needed one.",
"But when they measure themselves by themselves, and compare themselves with themselves, they are without understanding.",
"Who can describe his generation?",
"I am clean.",
"And to what shall I compare it?",
"When I went out again into the streets it was nearly dark.",
"He was so clean it hurt.",
"Nor was I glad.",
"Yet it is not strange.",
"And it was strange that I was glad immediately that I was to live.",
"And there was no resistance in me.",
"And the concept worked.",
"He was truly a water baby.",
"Every spring is followed by another spring.",
"There are such cases frequently.",
"So shall we seem still to be linked to the living world.",
"One afternoon everything seemed to go wrong.",
"I am glad I learned them.",
"He saw a long way, but he did not make believe he saw beyond his limit, and was content with it.",
"I must have a clean one.",
"This is not a hotel.",
"His manner was strange, his look wild.",
"The spring was covered with ice, hours old.",
"Yet, if he should not accept the offer, what was before him?",
"Send aid at once.",
"She is hardly what she is, much less what she was.",
"The strain upon him had been too great.",
"It is now just the top of spring with us.",
"I fear this can hardly be called a letter.",
"He is a strange old figure, to be sure.",

"Now that I noticed it, I was aware that it had been with me all the time.",
"There was no mention of going out fishing on either of our parts.",
"It was really wonderful when one thought of all the different elements that were represented in the party.",
"The military display seemed to interest him.",
"He was really sick of the whole thing.",
"It gives a new significance to the fact that I am.",
"How ought the soul of man to act in an emergency?",
"Yet these things he ought to know.",
"This is not a dream.",
"It is quick with the life of the race.",
"What is an abuse?",
"Not what it will bring me is primarily important, but what I can buy with it for the race.",
"How much ought I to be paid?",
"No one ought to live, if in health, who does not work.",
"Might as well be sick.",
"The officers looked at each other.",
"I said nothing, but looked knowing.",
"He ought to have left it to me.",
"There followed the rain, so of course I knew it would amount to nothing.",
"I had noticed them from time to time, always with increasing wonder.",
"They were sick of it, too, sick to death.",
"We hit, but without apparent effect.",
"I never noticed it before.",
"That would have been fishing.",
"Add a glass of white wine.",
"Serve with wine.",
"I have seen only one display of this kind that seemed in every way perfect.",
"But the effect is just the opposite.",
"He will even attempt at times to drive away dogs and men, especially if he has had no previous knowledge of them.",
"Generally, however, just the opposite is the case.",
"They met last week to play a match game.",
"I suspect!",
"The paper on the walls was light.",
"And I, too, good people, ought to be starting.",
"Lie still and rest.",
"His subsequent medical career is pretty generally known.",
"This he did as a friend, and in no way in a medical capacity.",
"He thought all that sort of thing ought to be put a stop to.",
"One evening they had a particularly gay party.",
"So gay, so full of life.",
"He ought not to hold so strong a position in her mind.",
"Now her dream was going to come true.",
"He became sick.",
"Then she became sick.",
"The baby was sick.",
"Again she became very sick.",
"Just as she got ready to go, her mother became sick.",
"At last they came to the village.",
"The village was dark and still.",
"The chief was sick.",
"He is very sick.",
"She went to the men of the village.",
"Some of the men ran down to the river.",
"They started for their own village.",
"She reached the road to the village before the men did.",
"Then they went on to their own village.",
"He made all the people of the village come to him.",
"It is wrong to lie.",
"We would not think that was a very big building, but it was the biggest in the village.",
"She told them of the good things they could get by trading.",
"Only a few people were left in the village.",
"The village paid the fine.",
"A quick thought came to her.",
"I have been sick and I must go where I can get strong again.",
"He became sick and had to go home.",
"It was a large trading center.",
"Nearly the whole village was sick.",
"Soon they came to a trading place.",
"Now they are being taken care of by native workers, but these have only little training.",
"When she came home from this trip she was sick again.",
"This made her feel sick.",
"I know of one, it is true, on the ground level, yet here I suspect a special economy.",
"But there are other kinds of dogs.",
"Once in a while I dream that I come upon a person who is reading a book that I have written.",
"This he gave to his troops.",
"But their trials were not over then.",
"One of us has got to clear out of here, and quick, too.",
"One of us has got to clear, and quick, too.",
"Being supported!",
"As if that matters, and yet somehow, it does.",
"Page him quick!",
"So quick!",
"Say, it ought to be.",
"Home now, quick!",
"We saw him in the train just now.",
"Its weight gave me hope that it would be sufficient.",
"The agency store was opposite this structure.",
"He died one week from the day on which he was taken sick.",
"I then left the officers and returned to our camp.",
"At last the time came to begin the match.",
"Fair river!",
"This is indeed no dream!",
"Some of the images are very effective.",
"Parties frequently come back with all the fishing they want.",
"He thought it was time to go for his train, and he went.",
"He said he thought it would just suit me.",
"There is no real probability that we shall be without ice before winter sets in.",
"I have no fear that my little girl will abuse the trust.",
"She had chosen to have it so.",
"The dogs were not quite ready.",
"Hi, there!",
"It seemed to have the opposite effect.",
"He hardly noticed them now.",
"It was short work getting down to the village.",
"Yes, it was typical.",
"Had he chosen this way?",
"The first thing everybody did on getting up, and the last thing everybody did on going to bed, was to look at the river.",
"He was very gay.",
"I ought to, I suppose.",
"I ought to have, perhaps.",
"Everything has come on so fast, and the children were ready to say it was because of the rain.",
"Some of these are chosen because the child can do something with them, can find their own uses for them, can play with them.",
"It is with the latter that we are concerned.",
"Great care has to be taken in going down this part of the river.",
"This river is, apparently, about half the size of the latter.",
"He gave me a good deal of information of which I give a summary.",
"The sick began to die.",
"Several officers dropped in.",
"Then she looked aside and saw me.",
"I think he was going down the river.",
"I even began to dream of success.",
"Long before it was time to go to meet the train, they were ready and waiting.",
"Her dream had followed her into the world of reality.",
"Then she raised herself upon her arm.",
"How strange to bring a sick woman away out of her room in her sleep!",
"I will lie down and die.",
"Here will I lie, and it will end.",
"Therefore it was no dream.",
"But it was no dream.",
"Was it a dream?",
"How I got through the hours before the starting of the train, I cannot tell.",
"I went out with him on his way to the train, to hear what he had to say about the boy.",
"It did not strike me in the same light.",
"If the year be bad on the east of the river, I act on the same plan.",
"Which of them will drive back for us these foreign troops?",
"His lie was found out.",
"But what troops can they be in that quarter?",
"But there were few signs of war.",
"He had no means of knowing.",
"It seemed like a dream.",
"If they have no dogs, we are all right.",
"Still another group passed, and they were talking of the dogs that were expected.",
"As soon as the dogs come we shall have no trouble.",
"A few of their number recognized this.",
"Made me sick.",
"They seemed to be suddenly closer together.",
"I have asked for his protection.",
"And if a new leader were to be chosen there was no doubt as to where the choice of the men would fall.",
"I was sick of it.",
"Made me sick inside.",
"Only I wish he had chosen some place else.",
"I caught him by the arm.",
"I need hardly add, that no member of her family knows anything about this matter, and it is especially important that her husband should never even suspect it.",
"But he ought to be told.",
"It gave upon the main street of the village.",
"But we must get away from here as quick as we can.",
"But no white man had ever seen this part of the great river.",
"So he would not explain just how it ought to be done.",
"He thought that they talk by some kind of signs.",
"There were no dogs about.",
"Perhaps she felt guilty.",
"There were many great pieces of ice in the river.",
"He could not get across the river.",
"In this they got across the main river.",
"The people who lived on the river did not know what to make of it.",
"At last the men came to the place where the dogs were.",
"The dogs ran after.",
"But nearly all of the dogs died in the long winter night.",
"Then he would lie down by them.",
"All these matters are important.",
"Power over words, like power of any other sort, is for use, not abuse.",
"In the following list only the native member of each pair is given.",
"They came to a pool.",
"She must get as far as possible from the pool before she stopped.",
"If somebody wanted to go through the train, he must get up.",
"Then he began to think about the girl he had met on board the train.",
"He did not know where the train was, only that it was near.",
"He felt she ought not to wear things like that.",
"A famous restaurant was not far off.",
"He saw she was not acting.",
"For example, it might not have been for nothing he met the girl on the train and got hurt.",
"For one thing, the line she ought to take was hard.",
"A village that has them not will not be found to work well.",
"The position of this class has thus far been improved by the war.",
"They are not chosen for their sense, but for their sound.",
"What woman, what society, is to be recognized as leader?",
"Not only as workers but as voters, the war has called women over the top.",
"The world is sick.",
"The others followed suit.",
"But the latter was too quick for him.",
"Well, she ought to know.",
"We ought to have heard of it before them.",
"Is that the action of a guilty man?",
"But I was too quick for him.",
"I would strike a light and see.",
"But I did not strike one then.",
"I felt sick.",
"All this time I was trying to tell where the telephone was.",
"She had not met me at the train.",
"I have no means of knowing now.",
"I had hardly heard the latter words, all my mind was on what he had said first.",
"At least, the latter is willing to give me the benefit of the doubt, which was more than I expected.",
"If so, I ought to know what it is.",
"There were signs of some other agency having been at work also.",
"I ought to remember it.",
"Then he started towards the door, only to stop again and cast another look back.",
"A lie!",
"I never thought of the telephone, and I doubt if she would have let me use it then.",
"There were no signs of movement.",
"They seemed to strike every heart.",
"At first I thought it was one of the dogs.",
"I have had dogs do that.",
"Each night she was calling earlier, and coming closer to the camp.",
"And they were dogs.",
"The little professor was looking the other way now.",
"It was not the little professor.",
"This story is true, and is not a lie.",
"The next day he returned to his fishing.",
"The latter went to the market.",
"They met a river.",
"Did he care for the opposite sex?",
"Wonder if she had noticed it?",
"A few examples, out of a great many, will be sufficient.",
"Now that it had been put into his head, however, to think what a good thing reading was, all this would apply no longer.",
"He never thought of any one hearing him, nor was it likely that any one in the village would be up yet.",
"He does far more good among the sick than I can.",
"That night he had a dream.",
"I heard a quick step on the floor, and the door opened ever so little.",
"As to the other officers, there is little to say.",
"I turned sick at heart as I looked at them.",
"Cast him into prison!",
"The sick could not die.",
"Open quick!",
"And no doubt the latter alternative is the true one.",
"Such a nation would be truly healthy.",
"It could never be healthy.",
"The result was amazing.",
"Their trials they began immediately.",
"He had met his match.",
"None of the officers with whom I talked believed that anything more could have been done by us than was done.",
"All are killed, as they lie.",
"Knowing all that I did, I was not surprised.",
"There were no signs yet of the break of day.",
"He seems as gay as ever.",
"But they came too late for the latter of these.",
"Here they soon caught much good fish, with which the sick improved, as it was fresh food, and the water of the river was very good.",
"No one knew how to speak to them, and they did not understand the signs which were made to them.",
"Few officers whom I have met took as much thought and trouble as he for the material welfare of his men.",
"It was about the last train that was running.",
"I could hardly believe that it was neither a stage setting nor a dream.",
"Many officers went there more than once.",
"A part of their dream is already come true, but part is a dream still, a debt to them that only we can pay.",
"I was still on my feet, and took a quick step toward him.",
"We had been very gay.",
"Yet for some reason the statement seemed to have an opposite effect.",
"If he noticed my action, he did not choose to comment.",
"My father raised his wine glass to the light.",
"The red of the wine seemed to please my father.",
"Was he still acting?",
"Perhaps, for instance, I was sick of the whole business.",
"I was too glad to see the cards fall as they did to call for a new deal.",
"Body of woman found in river.",
"He expected them, and had made up his mind to give full and detailed answers.",
"What court would find me guilty?",
"He was quick at learning when he began, but very slow at beginning.",
"The sources of the river were said not to be far off.",
"The latter were the more serious.",
"The question for us is, how ought we to keep it?",
"They cannot see what the latter part of it has to do with the former.",
"I have made my bed, and I must lie on it, and die on it too.",
"The significance of which is clear.",
"He cannot indeed write a sentence, but perhaps he may be able to spin a line.",
"Nothing, or almost nothing, of the walls remain.",
"When I heard this I went home much cast down, and from that time forward my mind was never easy.",
"This they watched her move, and saw her lie down upon it.",
"The conversation could not be ended in this summary fashion.",
"It did not suit him at all.",
"It was a big strike.",
"And we had wine.",
"And I have no one here to talk over old matters with.",
"They had not a bed left to lie upon.",
"When the rain was over, we came away.",
"These things, however, are all aside from the little matters which I wish to tell.",
"He had to turn away to avoid being sick.",
"He had, after all, come into a very strange land where the physical laws he was used to no longer seemed to apply.",
"It made him feel sick to even imagine it.",
"And almost everyone in town had to pass his house on the way to the train station.",
"He had seen the last of his native land.",
"I opposed the attempt.",
"I caught hold of his arm.",
"But such work was not without its trials.",
"She took it from her arm.",
"What is it I dream on?",
"How beautiful is the rain!",
"It was a bigger thing than any dream of.",
"Each village has its fire organization.",
"Bring the light closer, little mother.",
"The first face he recognized was a pretty one.",
"He felt like a man whose own dogs have turned against him.",
"I do not think that it matters much.",
"He treated them as men in the sense that he considered them to be under the same code of right and wrong, of good and evil.",
"But stand aside.",
"Closer, list!",
"Maybe I ought to go back and face the music.",
"He said it ought to be a fine thing.",
"He told me what his dream was.",
"But as I think of it, maybe this is just what somebody ought to do, and I might as well try it.",
"There are no such dogs now.",
"They do not suspect.",
"May I help myself to wine?",
"It is made with wine.",
"If the party be small, the wine may be placed only at the top of the table, near the host.",
"If it can be managed, take a little ice.",
"No, I took the first down train.",
"Why does he not strike out a system of his own?",
"Of course, I was now introduced in due form, and we went together up the steps.",
"But let us not be the victims of words.",
"He goes, knowing pretty well what he can do and what he cannot.",
"He ought to be off.",
"How different this was from our former gay days!",
"She thought that all these things would come right by and by when they came closer to each other.",
"The little girl who is in their care, however, has been so sick for a few days that they had to call the doctor.",
"The friend ought to hate to do wrong and ought to want to do right.",
"He certainly must say what his patient ought to eat.",
"She ought to be in there looking after things.",
"My voice has been cast throughout on the side of peace.",
"Most of them managed to reach the main body again.",
"Other officers also fell.",
"This is a lie.",
"There was little rest for the troops day or night.",
"It all seems like a wild dream to me.",
"The latter missed no chance.",
"It must be looked to, and that in quick season.",
"Nothing was said of any child, nor did I in the least suspect that I was about to become a father.",
"Far away, below me, I saw the same dark mass as before, but now grown closer and greater.",
"He would go fishing, and she would meet him while I was at my work in school.",
"And somehow as I looked I felt that the evil dream was all over.",
"The world has lost its healthy color.",
"Nothing could be more summary or more significant.",
"We shall pass away like a dream.",
"Some one of the party opposed to them?",
"The latter, as some say, immediately returned home.",
"At length he saw and heard that which he thought he ought to hear and see.",
"It is pretty hard to tell what ought to be done.",
"She has chosen her life.",
"This, however, did not exactly suit me.",
"The construction of the house was at once apparent.",
"I wish for my native air.",
"One of these I noticed especially.",
"The code is written and simple.",
"At that date they had apparently no doubt whatever as to the guilty party.",
"This is a base lie.",
"It was a way of his, however, not to show stress or worry.",
"He recognized the red color, the shape of the car.",
"That is all a lie.",
"He could not be gay, even under her influence.",
"It makes me sick.",
"I dream it.",
"I recognized that at the same moment I saw how very sick he was.",
"He was most interested in my troops.",
"He ought to sleep.",
"A rat!",
"My years of football have made action necessary.",
"No use to lie!",
"The secret must lie in the beyond, for men could not act that way for nothing.",
"The former was just human and the latter was simply knowledge.",
"Had to have it quick.",
"He never ought to have been forced to meet me.",
"The debt I thought I ought to pay.",
"The ice continues, and the cold.",
"We do not feel the need of knowing much about them.",
"My quick movement caused her to turn, and face him.",
"In all probability that was his purpose.",
"He is not likely to dream that we suspect him.",
"The chance has come for both of us, if we play the cards right.",
"Had I chosen the right course?",
"When he stopped the car she got down, not knowing just what to do or say.",
"Tell me, quick!",
"But he was at the telephone longer than he thought to be.",
"I will in all probability have my hands full.",
"On top of it went the articles of food.",
"The second match he gave to her.",
"Every where then, that which is in capacity is secondary to that which is in energy.",
"If therefore, these are in the latter, they will also be in the former.",
"For I think the latter are species of the former.",
"Was this a dream?",
"That is the economy of nature, but with it all there is not sufficient account taken of the works of man.",
"They would be kind if they could, but have more important matters.",
"Something like that ought to be sufficient to hold my practice.",
"And to think that her mother washed for me not so long ago, and that girl came for the clothes and brought them back again!",
"They want direct legislation.",
"The dream had come true!",
"The train went over the bank.",
"This was just what he had been hoping would happen.",
"There ought to be a way to stop these things.",
"These are small matters to me.",
"And now he will die for it, as a red man ought to die.",
"All the quick has gone off, and this is the real stuff, just as good as money.",
"Dogs take a great interest in what any one gets to eat.",
"Come quick.",
"She was a very knowing cat, and always came when she was called.",
"Dogs are like all other animals.",
"The river was away back of the village.",
"The big girl came forward, leading a tiny child that she placed in front of the boys and girls.",
"Our dogs would never learn to let them alone.",
"We ran them down with dogs.",
"He has followed me to the village, and he always wants to go fishing with me.",
"It makes me sick to go there.",
"It is a model village not only in that respect, but in others.",
"Will she turn aside?",
"She says she has a plan that will match them all.",
"How high that river was!",
"It was too much for the sick man.",
"So runs my dream.",
"Now this change has been produced by rain.",
"The sea has washed the land into them.",
"In human society the process continues.",
"Is not human nature primarily animal nature?",
"But no more so than the other members of the cast.",
"If the history of such an individual is followed from birth, one gets a pretty typical story.",
"For we have seen how closely all these are related in development.",
"I guess I ought to know.",
"These then were the wild dogs.",
"There were too many visitors at such times to suit him.",
"The economy ought to fall entirely on me.",
"There are many reasons for hoping that it will do so.",
"It matters everything from the point of view of social and economic and political life.",
"Be quick, my love, be quick!",
"Bring wine!",
"And it made me wonder a lot of things about that fishing trip.",
"Then we can follow that right down to the river.",
"Washed away in here.",
"Then we went to another store and got some post cards.",
"I knew now that the rain itself could never have done that.",
"Of course the whole school goes to the big football games, but asking us to see a practice game is something new.",
"I ought to pay it back.",
"Such thought as he now gave to football concerned the games still to come.",
"She ought to said it over twice.",
"He went to the school sick this morning.",
"He knew now what had been missing by the river.",
"But there is another secret band, having many of our signs.",
"I followed to the house, and then here, to the river.",
"And she could not tell her a lie.",
"The girls ought to know.",
"Just as it ought to be!",
"Was she not living a lie?",
"The train came and the boys were off.",
"I wanted to go fishing, and so I got through as soon as I could.",
"A train was coming in, but they did not expect to see anybody they knew.",
"Somehow he felt guilty, he could not tell why.",
"Indeed, they never noticed them until the game was at an end.",
"The river, we read, was turned into blood.",
"So the river was turned into blood.",
"This is what ought to have happened.",
"We are they that ought to speak.",
"He will speak not of what they will be, but of what they ought to be and can be.",
"He had chosen his men.",
"They all use the whole arm.",
"I shot him through the right arm and made him drop his gun.",
"He got that big arm of his around me.",
"He was still eating when they left.",
"But still every man may have, and ought to have a friend.",
"For the friend whom we have chosen for his own worth, will be the one who will be worth most to us.",
"Quick work, he called it.",
"How much of this was acting?",
"It began to rain.",
"They are always being sick!",
"As for his wife, he would tell her he had missed his train.",
"But that woman of my village is here.",
"They have both gone, one after the other, and I alone am guilty.",
"But do not tell me a lie.",
"She might long ago have had a family had she so chosen.",
"The train stopped.",
"We will lunch as quickly as possible and take the first train.",
"In these matters the child has no rights.",
"In these matters the child has a right to expect examples.",
"Then now or never is my time to strike.",
"How, a match!",
"Strike me?",
"Give me the lie?",
"Very sick, sick, and like to die!",
"I never gave such cause, for ought I know.",
"It was the same too with the cards.",
"Politics, of which they have amazing ideas, also came in for discussion.",
"Among these were a number of men from our village.",
"Would he ever, ever, grow too big for such a suit of clothes as that?",
"It was bad for a small house, truly, but not so much so when the same articles were given a fair chance to spread themselves.",
"But he was no match for him on the building question.",
"Rain, too, might come with it, but that would be of small account.",
"That was all any boy ought to have, black or white.",
"I proposed to transfer him to a somewhat less important position, but one in which I thought he could be of greater service.",
"The dogs were in fine condition.",
"The time had now come when we were forced to kill some of our dogs.",
"The culture was washed and placed in a new medium.",
"Behind the whole subject, of course, is the truth that, in the new order, government and business must be associated, closely.",
"In every village he found a friend.",
"They cannot get her away from there without my knowing it.",
"She was gay again now.",
"Yes, he would take a glass of wine.",
"He must have had it waiting in the village.",
"She was sick at heart.",
"Those are the troops.",
"Of such it may be said, that they do not play at cards, but only play at playing at them.",
"I suspect his knowledge did not amount to much.",
"I suspect his taste in higher matters.",
"It is amazing how a little of the more or less makes a difference in these things.",
"I can visit a sick friend.",
"How shall I ever own to her my guilty thought?",
"The acting was excellent.",
"I asked him how he managed his business.",
"I then asked him, if he thought it was going to rain?",
"It has a display section in front and a store room at the back.",
"I soon learned to be quick enough, and would get them before they could reach the water.",
"He lived to a great age, and was, in his latter years, supported by his son.",
"In those places the parties shall appear in person, and the judge make a summary decision.",
"Would they pay their own troops in aid of the common cause, when they found this nation ready to do it for them?",
"This is the way in which things are managed there.",
"But I suppose, he had her face washed, and put clean clothes on her.",
"But what can a sick man say, but that he is sick?",
"I wanted one train of ideas.",
"But let no man dream of influence beyond his life.",
"For matters had been going from bad to worse.",
"The latter has never been told until now.",
"And there were these other matters in both our lives.",
"We must use common sense in these matters.",
"He further expressed a wish to close the deal within the half hour, as he must leave town on the night train.",
"Through my opened door I followed her quick step.",
"Again she studied the cards.",
"The measure of my dream was full and running over.",
"Lie still.",
"A lie is a statement that something is, which is not.",
"What more natural than that they should keep their drugs for their own troops?",
"This did not suit her book at all.",
"So I was quick and glad to help in the little way I could.",
"I believe that things are improved.",
"That a man ought to be religious.",
"Out it must come, though it carry a lie on its back.",
"He tried to think, but the river would not let him.",
"Really we ought to have seen a little more of him.",
"There is lie the first, and look at lie the second.",
"Well, he may suit them.",
"I long for travel, and truly I am sick of my own country.",
"And no high water, no fishing.",
"Both these statements are wrong.",
"But it must remain a day dream more or less for the time being.",
"I wish I had studied it more closely than I have been able to.",
"The trials are the beginning of it.",
"She looked at me, but gave no sign that she recognized me.",
"I did not in this instance feel quite easy to put aside the whole of their service.",
"Many questions were asked, and a pretty detailed account given by us, as well as we were able.",
"The match was applied.",
"He was on the point of leaving the room when his eyes fell upon the cable.",
"I said something I ought not to have done.",
"Drink some more wine.",
"I feel suddenly gay.",
"And ought we to ask some questions?",
"I can think quick and act quick.",
"She caught at his arm.",
"I wish to add that I ought perhaps to have told all this at first.",
"Both women noticed it.",
"The others already were eating.",
"By knowing all things else, we know him less.",
"Shall I be still in suit?",
"Always, when my mother started for the river, I stopped my play to run along with her.",
"I had never seen a train, and he knew it.",
"He did not fear her, but followed closely after me.",
"And now in his old age he was cast into prison.",
"It is like a dream.",
"The life we lead in this house would make a cat sick.",
"She was, indeed, living in the past, and it was the present that seemed a dream to her.",
"There will be sufficient at the bank to pay such small claims.",
"Almost every kind of literature is represented.",
"So they put them in, and made them fast in the stocks.",
"If they had turned to the right instead of to the left, they would have been opposed.",
"One lie more.",
"Could they lie down?",
"There was little military display.",
"These men having gone, it was noticed that several of my papers were missing.",
"Did he feel himself already chosen?",
"That is sufficient.",
"It is not sufficient to kill people.",
"They washed the body.",
"Are they guilty?",
"These were significant signs.",
"How well the thing had been managed!",
"Each felt that he was going where he ought to go.",
"This washed him.",
"Suddenly the train stopped.",
"This operation, therefore, should not be opposed by the mother.",
"Well, then, is the sick child at the breast?",
"To hold this language was sufficient.",
"His account, though short, is quite sufficient for our purpose.",
"The process is so clearly detailed, that any one may follow it.",
"It was the first time he had ever opposed his mother.",
"The men could not realize how sick he was.",
"I shall lie down and sleep.",
"I, for as great matters as we are about.",
"Cannot death strike him?",
"A match.",
"If we could but talk with dogs!",
"I want something closer.",
"One can just lie down and die sometimes.",
"There is nothing in it particular aside from that.",
"The arm would not rise!",
"Any explanation is enough for any one in a dream.",
"The display was something worth looking at.",
"They reached their separate homes somehow, and washed and went to bed.",
"My idea was to go forward in the career I had chosen.",
"Acting upon his good advice, from that time to this I have never been in trouble again.",
"They get pretty near sometimes, however, without knowing it.",
"The responsibility cast upon me was great.",
"As we went along, what should we see but a rat!",
"It seemed to him as though he was in a dream.",
"He ought to be back by this time.",
"He had noticed it earlier in the day.",
"The train was on a big scale.",
"There was no further call on the telephone.",
"Here was a little cluster of houses.",
"The latter took one look at it and passed it back.",
"There is no question the party is guilty.",
"I hardly recognized myself in the part.",
"Had it been only a dream?",
"The latter did not look at him.",
"The man moved toward a telephone at his back.",
"It was like an evil dream.",
"It is a good match for her.",
"Did she dream?",
"Even the river had not stopped their flight.",
"Probably the latter.",
"He was not needed closer.",
"The man had played his cards well.",
"If the chance came he would strike.",
"Even then they had to keep close to the walls in order not to lose contact with the house.",
"She was forced to throw it aside and begin on another piece.",
"Who he was or where he was going they did not know, but he seemed to be making for the great river in the north.",
"But it was a possibility that did not look like a probability.",
"He turned and looked straight at them, but he gave no sign of knowing they were there.",
"The latter points were of great importance.",
"The result was immediately apparent.",
"I never noticed them before.",
"In another minute I should lose the train.",
"And I must not lose the train.",
"No one opening the safe on other business would suspect the change that had been made.",
"We went into the restaurant, I moving as if I were in a dream.",
"Second, we say the matter really amounts to nothing, anyway.",
"Other times, the opposite is true.",
"I got out of there quick and took off down the street.",
"It was like a dream come true.",
"But having chosen he must be true to his choice.",
"Let them have their too much and grow sick of it!",
"He managed them with one hand.",
"I am as guilty as the others.",
"Because there was more rain then than now?",
"I had almost said, they ought to be content.",
"He managed to make the job last over so that he could return in the afternoon.",
"She must telephone him.",
"A man and a woman were opposite, with their little boy between them.",
"But there was no one to apply them.",
"Of course, some few words were passed between him and the officers.",
"I told them outside the village.",
"By our economy we managed to get on very well.",
"He ought to have taken some other name.",
"It makes me sick to hear her talk sometimes.",
"The very dogs here are above such things.",
"He ought to be there for the box by this time.",
"Let us all lie down, and sleep with him.",
"This could by no means seem sufficient.",
"Thinking and doing have hardly recognized each other.",
"That might happen again, and less chance of any one knowing it.",
"I asked him how quick he was.",
"Tell me, then, how quick?",
"I know not why, unless because I watch her so closely.",
"We were kind of hoping the next one might be a change.",
"A well man, not a sick one.",
"He came on the train.",
"But it has to lie there.",
"Except over church matters.",
"That she ought to have known it all along.",
"It is possible that she had some good reason for coming on that particular train.",
"A little rain would do good.",
"Why should she lie to me?",
"He turned down towards the river road.",
"He might come from the opposite direction.",
"He would not allow himself even to dream that she had changed.",
"I ought not to have come down to the post at all.",
"It was getting rather hard to be gay.",
"She felt sick at heart.",
"But it would have been more strange if any one had noticed it.",
"Hospital train.",
"Everybody recognized that fact.",
"They found her guilty.",
"But he did not hear it strike.",
"This is nothing but a strike suit.",
"A strike suit?",
"They expect us on this train.",
"In reality, he was considering matters.",
"Police officers?",
"Nothing in his subsequent course of action indicated that they did.",
"The next day the heavy rain still continued.",
"I was watching him closely and at first did not notice that others were with him.",
"We must have legislation, and we must have it in time.",
"The time will come when this will be generally recognized.",
"But of course it must seem rather amazing.",
"And we might have gone by train!",
"Such is the fun of knowing so little about the world.",
"Nor had we long to wait, and little did we suspect what our meeting with that beautiful river was to mean.",
"Ought I not, then, to be free?",
"The day after that I was taken sick.",
"The lawyer noticed it.",
"He was on the train.",
"The lawyer did not come until it was nearly time for the train to start.",
"Before they had finished eating, the child came back, saying that she could not find him.",
"The early morning train would carry both of them beyond his reach.",
"Would it not make of him a living, walking lie?",
"In all probability he would never be there again to work.",
"She ought to know.",
"He recognized it.",
"It seemed to him that he ought to go to places with which he was familiar.",
"He knew what it contained, though, and that was sufficient for him.",
"They had not noticed them at first.",
"He started to his feet and moved up closer to the fall, looking into the dark places under the rock.",
"Aside from that, the place was very, very still.",
"She went up once more to the room in which he was to lie until health should return to him, to see that it was ready to receive him.",
"Had a bad dream.",
"He said, he could not understand how a man could apply to one thing, and not to another.",
"Here was a fine old plane tree.",
"A village is like a heart to a country.",
"A man could only strike once with it.",
"It is for want of knowing their own power.",
"Nothing is good but what is consistent with truth or probability, which this is not.",
"River running through the park.",
"She thought the cards would have dropped from her hands on seeing him.",
"Now she was almost gay.",
"He showed no signs that he had done so.",
"Never mind who ought to call on me first!",
"From this original cell, by growth and development, the body, with all its various tissues, is built up.",
"Rest and work are relative terms, directly opposed to each other.",
"Now, the blood comes into direct contact with every one of these tissues.",
"The latter need not be taken into account.",
"Is it not a dream?",
"The government was well enough represented.",
"This letter never left this village.",
"He shall dream, and the day will have more significance.",
"Suspect a man like him of murder!",
"And he brought away the great suit with him.",
"Rain at night.",
"Now is he in a train.",
"Then will my protection be again necessary.",
"He as much concerned, and so he ought to think, as I, to have that observed.",
"When he was very cold, and ready to lie down and sleep again to forget, he came quite suddenly on an opening in the trees.",
"She made pretty signs to him to open the window and let her in.",
"But no one noticed.",
"It will only make matters worse.",
"But that is like a dream.",
"I noticed it.",
"If he had, no one had noticed him.",
"That man said the train would come along soon.",
"A slow train might not go off the track, as the break is only a small one.",
"This is about the only suit I have.",
"She had the same beautiful little face, but she was more gay, more of the world.",
"Her dear village!",
"But it seems to me they are rather gay, considering they have not seen me for so long.",
"Every one, when he is whole, can give advice to them that are sick.",
"I am sick, I must die.",
"Abuse her name!",
"Stand back, lie close, and let them pass by.",
"She appears to feel as she ought.",
"She introduced the movement of the world into the great house.",
"He meant to catch the first train the next morning, and get at once far away from his native town.",
"But it matters nothing.",
"He recognized her immediately by the heavy mass of her hair.",
"He had recognized the voice.",
"Who is it recognized him first?",
"He looked not a little sick.",
"But he was acting as if he knew.",
"He began to feel a little sick.",
"Foot and arm.",
"But he believed that his knowledge was sufficient to serve his purpose.",
"And what sort of a river was it?",
"I love to meet the brother officers of my dear lost husband.",
"They apply here.",
"Those are sufficient.",
"The die had been cast.",
"We thought that we should have more talk, talk, and we are all sick of talk.",
"His blood is red and healthy, but it does not show through.",
"But the question of time has another kind of significance.",
"He would have been noticed.",
"It was a small matter, but very typical of him.",
"I ought not to have let this happen.",
"These ought not to be used.",
"How it ought to be.",
"Train up a child in the way he should go.",
"But this ought not so to be.",
"So is a hand or an arm.",
"The latter have very little to do with it.",
"The same rules, in this respect, apply to eating, as well as to dress.",
"On this account, the arm on which they rest should be often changed.",
"If parents and other friends lie in bed late themselves, can anything else be, expected of children?",
"And if the quality, amount and general character of the latter are important, those of the former are by no means less so.",
"Still this is only the abuse of a good thing.",
"The dream is only a means to this end.",
"It may have recognized the mind, but not the soul, which is greater than the mind.",
"This I think a sufficient answer.",
"There is no giving rules, however, in these matters, without a knowledge of the case.",
"It was never more apparent than in the address in question.",
"He liked to ask and follow her advice in many matters.",
"In return, I tried to give him some advice about how to set matters right, for the future, with his wife.",
"I was healthy and strong.",
"I should be very certain that I had said nothing of much significance, if they did not.",
"Relationships, political, religious, social, domestic.",
"Once I tried to run away there, but they set the dogs after me.",
"Each column represented one group of letters.",
"If so, we would like to be recognized as members of the church.",
"Under such a regulation matters passed on for a term of years.",
"Many had gone over the river.",
"The action cut the father to the quick.",
"At the next village we found all we needed.",
"The troops were ahead of him by an hour.",
"Hardly the latter, for more are coming than going.",
"Then they had followed him closely.",
"No one had noticed her.",
"That the count felt this also was apparent.",
"She had noticed this interest once before.",
"Happy river!",
"There she should lie at peace.",
"We are used to the dogs.",
"His plan of operations was to support the latter, but to act entirely independent of him.",
"How fresh and healthy it looks!",
"He was positive that that was just what she ought to have!",
"And knowing it, my own!",
"Again I said how sorry I was, and added that perhaps she ought to show it to a medical man.",
"I watch them growing up from year to year in many a village.",
"Another very good view is from closer up to the church.",
"I explained matters as well as I could, and found him very willing to listen to our side of the question.",
"Help to the sick and poor.",
"If he does, it is an abuse of terms to say that he is dead.",
"Wine is strong enough for me.",
"There ends the dream.",
"It certainly is not a name that one would apply to a man at random, with a probability that it would be right.",
"Not clearly knowing what else to do I followed him to the window and looked out.",
"What he had learned he had learned by himself, and the books he had read were but few, and chosen rather by chance.",
"I know the whole story, but I also know him, and I know that he cannot lie.",
"She ought to go away, but I understand she has no friends at a distance with whom she can stay.",
"I ought to know.",
"Suppose he is strong, healthy, and willing to work.",
"At any rate, it was a most beautiful dream.",
"It was a dream.",
"More rain comes down here than in any other region in the world.",
"But that night came rain.",
"Then there was the fishing.",
"The die was cast.",
"How much more matters of this life!",
"And who is sufficient for these things?",
"So he went and washed, and came back seeing.",
"Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.",
"These things, too, are my concern, the river says.",
"I shall have the telephone taken out.",
"The latter was of a very simple sort.",
"These matters are really not in my way.",
"These matters cannot now be put aside.",
"They would not hear of the match.",
"That ought to make him interesting to everybody.",
"The look of his face was a wine to me.",
"I was sick at heart with the looks of them.",
"When I see a man who does not think pretty well of himself, I always suspect him of being in the right.",
"May it bring me money for myself and my sick one, who may read it, I do not know how soon.",
"I feel sick even to think of it.",
"I am off the sick list.",
"They suit me.",
"But it matters not.",
"I suspect that is now the case.",
"But, man, there have been days when I felt guilty, and thought I was in no position for the head of a house.",
"By what I can find out it ought to be through hand with that and ready for volume form early next spring.",
"A town, village.",
"A lie.",
"To lie down.",
"Little, small, tiny.",
"To cast, throw.",
"And I no longer took notes of anybody, and I asked no questions, knowing that nothing would come of this.",
"The river life was very pretty.",
"They are a healthy race."],

["I dress myself as a man, and go forth with some of them.",
"Later, a question repeated itself.",
"At first, it was impossible to make out anything.",
"There were no signs of steps, nor even the appearance of there ever having been any.",
"If that were the case, it would go on increasing in volume, until I should find it impossible to leave the place.",
"The speed seemed to increase, even as I looked.",
"I put out my other hand, and touch it.",
"In the country it was the only topic of conversation.",
"However, on the whole, the people in our part of the world were reasonable.",
"Will and heart together work for victory.",
"Hence no real thought will quite go into words.",
"In a right way, we should all love gain.",
"The great man can begin anywhere, or with any task.",
"No evidence of fire anywhere else.",
"This was now seen to be impossible.",
"It almost seemed to me that I could reach out my hands and touch it, as one would touch a wall.",
"He caught as fast as he could cast his fly.",
"Few places in this world are more dangerous than home.",
"To all appearance their behavior is just the same on seeing a man for the first time, as when they have seen him frequently.",
"Quite the reverse.",
"The question was again repeated.",
"He stands, in fact, a great deal.",
"He stands round to talk, to hear, and especially to drink.",
"He gave her the same bunch he had given me the night before.",
"The above view of the house will give a good idea of its outside appearance.",
"Besides, I had no choice of means.",
"To get out was impossible.",
"It would be a difficult task.",
"I accepted straight out.",
"Having accepted he ought to have turned up on the right night.",
"Besides he was going to see her tonight.",
"Soon the owner of the woman came and took her back.",
"The church was filled with people.",
"This filled her with fear.",
"They planned bad things against my boy.",
"No one else could touch it.",
"Now no one could touch them.",
"When she wanted to go anywhere, she had to be carried.",
"I accepted the part he offered me.",
"Here is the brief story.",
"There are some of us who call this freedom.",
"We got a grand view.",
"Let me pull down the bed.",
"But they warm me.",
"He put out a short, broad hand toward her.",
"When could it have been if not after my sister broke her confidence to tell me?",
"Let me touch her.",
"What followed is too sad to be related in detail.",
"What followed it is hardly necessary to describe in detail.",
"I rather expected he might have come, as before, to discuss the case with us, but he has made a point of keeping away.",
"In a few minutes she made her appearance.",
"True, he had seen them walking together in secret, which was strange enough, but that need not necessarily have been a planned meeting.",
"I saw that it would be impossible to stop them.",
"Of course I accepted his offer.",
"I broke down.",
"Hence the name.",
"The night was warm.",
"The morning broke.",
"Certainly it was warm in here, though there was no fire that he could see.",
"It was gold.",
"Besides, the thing was too good to be true.",
"Gold, too?",
"It had been very well to feel set up because they had done the thing that everybody said was impossible.",
"But she set about the task.",
"Besides, he had other business on his mind.",
"Nothing that men had ever made out of gold was so entirely beautiful as this.",
"The owner turned again to the gold.",
"They had said so as the day shift turned out.",
"Stand forth.",
"Looks on himself, and feels about him.",
"But art alive?",
"Not touch her!",
"But as it is, he is dangerous.",
"And I have accepted it as if it were a matter of course.",
"In order to gain real knowledge of himself, of his power, a child needs to compare his power with that of others.",
"We choose stories that appeal to our audience.",
"This is a question for future experience on the part of teachers.",
"This is progress.",
"His information will be given in detail further on.",
"But his task was very different and the time required much longer.",
"This of course broke up the meeting at once.",
"Of course there were many other causes at work.",
"She was in the same position when the morning broke.",
"Why, man alive, one has to have a big head here.",
"But it seemed that he did not want company, for he broke into a run.",
"I, who had said nothing, now broke in.",
"I had the sense to catch the girl and pull her after him.",
"It fairly broke my heart.",
"But I realized that I could not do this.",
"And then the impossible thing happened.",
"Then suddenly they realized that they were moving.",
"There was never a minute of the day for which something interesting was not planned.",
"It seemed impossible that it should come to an end.",
"Then some one repeated what she had heard before.",
"Besides, she is not thinking at all about me.",
"What am I, that I should do what they all said was impossible?",
"I was glad, besides, to take advantage of the explanation which one was giving to the other.",
"It was freedom.",
"The common man is the reverse.",
"I saw him ever making progress.",
"The fear of it the wish cuts short.",
"Where can I fly?",
"Every year there is one such offering, and each class has its own day for it.",
"In any case the topic was very successful.",
"He stopped again, turning round to her.",
"Whose it was and the explanation of its appearance even occurred to his mind.",
"It is impossible to say.",
"It is not, if there be a reasonable cause for the change.",
"Hence its real nature is at first by no means apparent, and has been the subject of much discussion.",
"It would not do to take them to task before the company.",
"The battle was to begin that very day.",
"Look how they fly along!",
"How many days had passed since the battle?",
"But they are gone, and he must fly.",
"To him the law of the impossible has no meaning.",
"There is no time to think of food until we get away from this dangerous neighborhood.",
"He repeated it several times, but there was no response.",
"I can get no assistance here.",
"Fly, fly the house at once!",
"Then, turning into the library, he saw that the host was alone.",
"There is not one but I have watched him in the stress of battle.",
"There was gold.",
"Much gold.",
"Which speed is the thing I want.",
"Besides, I must be alone with him for a moment.",
"The experience in battle was there, too.",
"The gold was running fine and free.",
"That accounts for nobody knowing him.",
"Besides, he was, after all, losing nothing which he had not already lost.",
"Was it indeed possible to fly to them instead?",
"I quite enjoy looking out a bunch of books for her, and watching to see which one will most appeal to her.",
"The situation was impossible.",
"Those who looked at her realized this.",
"Would she forget some detail that she must know?",
"And again he repeated the word to himself.",
"It was winter, and they had no warm houses to stay in.",
"They had not even warm clothes.",
"The battle was soon over.",
"But he found that it was a battle.",
"She led the little boy into the shop also.",
"Key could see the battle.",
"This almost broke his heart for a while.",
"It was now summer, but it did not get warm.",
"This chapter and the following, therefore, are given over to the study of words in combination.",
"Speech, like a man, should be alive.",
"Our first task in this volume was the study of words in combination.",
"He had finished the task.",
"His progress, both in the thought and in the language, will be from the general to the specific.",
"Besides, it was too soon for cards.",
"Besides, he was not making much progress.",
"It was part of the price he must pay for freedom.",
"After a time he stopped in front of a shop in a short side street.",
"She wanted to play an active part and feel she was alive.",
"Her progress was obvious.",
"Besides, she wanted to think.",
"Somehow it looked impossible, but she was moving.",
"Was it broke when I fell?",
"But if it is a house, let us always keep in mind that the appearance of it, being really secondary, must be seen to have been held so throughout.",
"I reached forth my hand to take it down.",
"If the sea wants songs, it will have them.",
"We are told that discussion is dangerous.",
"Dangerous to what?",
"But suddenly, no matter how great our efforts, no one answers our appeal.",
"Everything that helps the country is great.",
"Besides, some of them have come out.",
"Assistance on the way.",
"He determined to give battle.",
"The distance was so close now that a miss was impossible.",
"But the battle was not over yet.",
"But his assistance was not needed.",
"It was suggested in some of the newspaper accounts that an explanation of the cause of his return might throw some light on the murder.",
"If I could show him up and pull him down, I would.",
"Is such a story reasonable or likely?",
"Often we were together, and often we wrote letters when to meet was impossible.",
"I had seen them when I passed through the kitchen earlier in the day.",
"I did not know she was in the building, alive or dead.",
"I should gain nothing by saying no.",
"Her eyes filled, and she said no more.",
"Turning away, he made for the door.",
"It was her first appearance in court.",
"The case was his and he would gain it if he could.",
"A losing game thus far.",
"For the first time the dog did not seem to feel her touch.",
"He began to pull.",
"Alive, they are worth to me a great deal.",
"And his appearance was changing, as well as his view of things.",
"It could not fly.",
"Besides, I like to be alone.",
"She went to the city, and there saw a rich shop.",
"Chapter I.",
"Their general appearance.",
"It had not been accepted.",
"From doubt the truth may come forth.",
"She filled his heart completely.",
"What need to detail further?",
"Would that I could tell the story as he told it, but that were impossible.",
"I am certain of victory.",
"A great light broke upon me.",
"I saw that my assistance was not needed.",
"Reflect well.",
"How am I to live without anything alive about me?",
"Sex itself is a positive battle.",
"At one time it appeared as if we should have to fight hard to gain it.",
"We saw and heard the traffic on this section of the line.",
"Off the road it became almost impossible to move.",
"And the price of their victory?",
"Then even that became impossible.",
"For I am turning now to a new task.",
"They stand for the most part as the battle left them.",
"Our own troops have never been more sure of final victory.",
"The situation is still critical and dangerous.",
"Its success was due to the reverse being the truth.",
"Now let us carry forth our children.",
"Indeed, the small bunch still remained in the safe door.",
"To carry the body far would require assistance, and in my own mind I believed the crime to have been the work of one person.",
"She repeated what she had already told me, yet she could not remember where she had seen a similar figure before.",
"Man alive!",
"Their views were not, however, generally accepted.",
"They had neither the experience nor the power necessary to maintain their position.",
"Yes, he actually repeated it!",
"Before he came again, the country had made wonderful progress.",
"What led him into those dangerous places we have very little chance of knowing.",
"It was an impossible task.",
"The original break was due to many causes.",
"We got the car out at last, but the road was too bad for further progress and it was almost dark.",
"Our streets were broad and even.",
"Call me dangerous company.",
"Indeed, I find it quite impossible to leave.",
"I think he had often planned that leave taking.",
"There are accounts to be made up.",
"My wife was here, too, and alive.",
"Why not discuss matters here, for the present, I mean?",
"His evidence was brief and to the point.",
"Hence, the materials were present.",
"Then he broke in.",
"He went to the kitchen.",
"Now, be reasonable!",
"We know that she went to his shop.",
"No, it was impossible.",
"Everybody likes him.",
"On one point of detail some change will very likely by and by be called for.",
"It is not by any means unlikely that these causes all combined to produce the name.",
"This was the crisis of the battle.",
"When they could not agree on a peace, they gave the signal for battle.",
"Does that state of things look much like progress of the human race?",
"This text is a very important one.",
"Consider that one text.",
"But he shall save his soul alive.",
"How should I be able to pull through such a trouble?",
"Do I mean, then, that the text has nothing to do with us?",
"To describe a thing so ancient is impossible.",
"As for me I was more dead than alive!",
"But I am not sure she is yet alive, my dear.",
"Very much alive, I believe.",
"The will is brief, but it will hold good in law.",
"I knew him, and that not long since, when he had a most warm heart.",
"I think it will be popular among the little people, besides money.",
"I shall begin to feel a little more alive with the spring.",
"Just look at this shop book.",
"These, of course, have mostly been sold during the hard times to keep life in the owner and his family.",
"Besides, he had too much work to do.",
"All he had ever wanted was to go home, and now he knew that he was never going to achieve that goal.",
"Finding him would not be an easy task.",
"He recognized it first by its appearance.",
"In free countries, when great results are produced it is from great causes that they spring.",
"I showed the gold to him.",
"The meeting then broke up.",
"A severe trial was at hand.",
"Of her life in this famous prison we have little or no detail.",
"The work soon increased, and assistance was needed.",
"Believe me now, I never killed a mouse, nor hurt a fly.",
"Hence it is included here.",
"The rooms are always too warm.",
"The room had the appearance of an office.",
"They make no progress.",
"She could only see his broad back.",
"It was impossible there.",
"Without her assistance he never would have had it.",
"This man had played dangerous cards before now.",
"Besides, we have all the time.",
"But it was dangerous.",
"I have done nothing the law can touch.",
"We were too dangerous.",
"The program had gone at top speed for more than an hour.",
"He felt his new freedom.",
"Besides, it is a part of this story.",
"Which thing came to pass, as may one day be recorded.",
"And the church should send teachers.",
"The rest is detail.",
"To each one he said a word of appeal.",
"If they are not gain to those who take them, they are loss enough to the others.",
"The beginning of the task, however, is not in any way difficult.",
"That it largely helps to do this there can be no doubt.",
"These little matters of detail must, of course, be left to individual taste.",
"If the weather is very warm, these are usually left open until the last thing at night, to cool the rooms.",
"Keep on low diet.",
"The diet should also be the same.",
"They read a great many religious books besides.",
"It is all alive, as if each word had a soul in it.",
"Only when the children said no more she came back to her task.",
"No, impossible!",
"All this he had accepted as if it could not be otherwise.",
"I saw the kitchen just now.",
"It was a grand success from the start.",
"The experiment was never repeated.",
"This was the only real battle of the war.",
"Of course it was not accepted.",
"This ended the first phase of the great battle.",
"I saw nothing of the battle.",
"None knew what was going on anywhere but a few feet in front.",
"The battle was one in which no quarter was asked or even possible.",
"In war that is impossible.",
"See that she is kept warm.",
"I know where the gold comes from!",
"With a little effort he finished the task.",
"However, one of them was alive, just alive, but we have had a hard job to pull him through.",
"The battle began.",
"He knew nothing about that, but meanwhile he continued to kill.",
"The winter was severe.",
"She then put forth a front of battle.",
"The chief of these moral causes is the character of a people.",
"His world of ideas did not touch our world at any point, so that real talk between us was impossible.",
"I remember all these, though, if they were alive, I do not think that any of them would remember me.",
"But in none of them did victory come in the expected shape.",
"I am not concerned to discuss the education problem.",
"View, appearance.",
"But it turned out as follows.",
"Quite the reverse of his charge is true.",
"It was impossible for him to please both.",
"Thus another form of battle was brought about.",
"Of what moved them to this I have no knowledge, for it has not been recorded.",
"Such was the progress of the events of those days.",
"This apparent loss is of course in reality nothing but gain.",
"The old man repeated the question.",
"Not until she repeated her question did he answer her.",
"This, however, I found impossible.",
"On the return of the family, my host was met at the door with such accounts of what had happened as led him at once to see and question his daughter.",
"It was impossible to answer.",
"My task was not quite done.",
"It is impossible to imagine what will happen when serious events really come.",
"At present it is impossible to test the value of this evidence.",
"The latter represents the truth.",
"When looked at closely, how truly gold their color!",
"If I could find out where that gold comes from!",
"He felt that it contained a presence besides his own.",
"This indeed was being in a front line of battle.",
"But she realized at once that in this instance she could not get any news from him.",
"Before he died he realized his crime.",
"I had it all planned.",
"Fine bunch of boys, though.",
"It broke me all up.",
"She feels what she does not know.",
"If life was meant for that why do we have progress?",
"We must see that bunch.",
"It was impossible.",
"They charged, running low.",
"It filled her mind and her body.",
"The world of learning is so broad, and the human soul is so limited in power!",
"Several teachers were with me.",
"It is a wonder that teachers work as well as they do.",
"The great gain would be freedom of thought.",
"He was broad in his religious views.",
"I, of course, accepted it.",
"Therefore, we try for the impossible.",
"But now it did, as the full truth suddenly came home, that I could buy my freedom.",
"It is in gold and notes.",
"These were questions impossible to answer.",
"The task would not even be a difficult one.",
"Meanwhile we must not appear interested in each other.",
"It could gain him no advantage.",
"This was my first appearance in the show business.",
"They soon had the whole bunch under control, and we all got together to see if anybody was hurt.",
"That is the way it stands now.",
"And all for something other than just gold at the end of it.",
"Hence, what was to be, remained to be seen.",
"Nor was the task the impossible one it looked from a distance.",
"He was up before her, offering her his hand.",
"She wanted to run, run anywhere, just to be lost to him.",
"Then the gold was here!",
"But her heart was warm.",
"For at last she knew with her brain, as all along she had known in her heart, that it was to be victory.",
"But this is impossible.",
"But the task is beyond the power of the present generation.",
"What follows?",
"Perhaps, and no unlikely thought!",
"Running made them warm.",
"He would play up and play the game, even if it were a losing fight.",
"It was enough for him to be alive and warm.",
"It filled the whole table, and pieces dropped on the floor.",
"I am going into the city to see our leader, and I want to see how he feels.",
"He was never allowed to touch a gun at home.",
"The old man broke away, and ran to try and save them.",
"He said that he would make things fly.",
"He would never drop it nor leave it anywhere.",
"It almost broke her heart.",
"He tells me that she had a bad name among all the dogs in her neighborhood.",
"I have come now to the last chapter of my story.",
"They filled.",
"But its owner did not build.",
"Hard was the battle against death.",
"Is it not reasonable to suppose that it is?",
"A fair and reasonable guess, which would in many cases, indeed in most, be quite true.",
"And it certainly helps us to believe that a thing has been done, if we are shown that it can be done.",
"For what else is the content of the idea of freedom?",
"Just the same there is no other method of progress.",
"It becomes a task to make these children grow and gain.",
"Besides, a gun like that is dangerous to the community, I think.",
"He believed there was gold in this region.",
"And, besides, I like them, and I want them to stay a good while.",
"What has been the value of that freedom?",
"Every one knows the trouble that follows.",
"As broad as it is long.",
"Every little helps.",
"It is easier to pull down than to build.",
"But dangerous is the way.",
"The challenge was accepted.",
"I had to just pull his hand off my arm, he was holding so fast to it.",
"Besides it was getting dark.",
"From a decision like this there could be no appeal.",
"The victory was immediately decided.",
"Bring any new songs out?",
"She likes new places.",
"Such a little thing to think of, such a little thing to do, before he could go forth to meet them!",
"I have planned it all.",
"Between themselves the girls may send her somewhere while I am gone and I want to make that impossible.",
"Her eyes filled before she could answer him.",
"They had no right to touch me.",
"Some new students had been standing at a distance watching the scene described in the last chapter.",
"A minute later one of the teachers appeared.",
"Then if that human nature be evil, what follows?",
"I think that if we will take the story simply as it stands we shall see easily enough.",
"That is no reason why we should not look at the parts of the chapter which we can understand and can explain.",
"He never even anywhere told them that they would live again after this life.",
"In this chapter is another instance of the same.",
"But if that be not true, what follows?",
"He just likes to read because he can sit still and do it.",
"Progress became less easy almost at once.",
"He went back to the hotel and went into the kitchen to find food.",
"All this filled a matter of weeks.",
"Besides, food had been before him.",
"Now what could be more reasonable?",
"What is the reverse?",
"And, besides, they worked as they grew older, and brought a little money in.",
"But as for me, my dear doctor, it is impossible.",
"And, above all things, they are not to go into the kitchen.",
"I can never come home without finding them in the kitchen.",
"And he helps her.",
"Was he still alive?",
"Is he alive?",
"Tell me simply whether he is alive.",
"I do all I can for him, and he is reasonable enough not to ask me to do more.",
"Besides, he now had his wife against him.",
"Besides, that would not suit my plans.",
"I do not discuss this view.",
"Everybody seems alive.",
"It stands between the points.",
"Why, is his house of gold?",
"Then he began turning over the names of schools in his mind.",
"It was a hard enough task.",
"They seemed to put on an extra touch of speed on their own account, just then.",
"This time it was accepted.",
"Besides, her population is mixed.",
"They have no appeal.",
"That the parties would go so far as to pair off their women workers against each other is unlikely.",
"Both of these causes were important, the latter especially so.",
"Added to all this are the ever important economic causes.",
"By night they had charged.",
"It is next to impossible to do so.",
"And so forth.",
"Is that freedom?",
"It was a wonderful battle.",
"We have no time to discuss our business at this table.",
"It may be thought that their small number made the task an easy one.",
"It was a warm night and there had been no rain for some days.",
"He took the wrong turning years ago.",
"I have little concern in the progress of events.",
"But that is impossible.",
"Time stands still in a manner to me.",
"I have worked task work, and have the rest of the day to myself.",
"It is impossible to pull her to pieces in this manner.",
"Battle too.",
"I think we should suit one another mainly.",
"The population is greater than the appearance of the town would lead one to expect.",
"To sleep was impossible.",
"Many of the plants were for sale.",
"Many are considered dangerous.",
"I wrote numerous letters as a result.",
"To imagine, that we are going forward, when we are only turning round.",
"It is impossible to carry on military operations in such a country during summer.",
"In the course of this work a numerous variety of names has been mentioned, to which many might be added.",
"Come forth, man!",
"Nor, in the little time left to us, did I ever achieve a condition higher than this.",
"An opinion of any sort was impossible.",
"That last touch seemed to have been needed.",
"First, it was impossible to think of going to her daughter.",
"I shall not detail a conversation that could have but little interest to others.",
"It was simple enough, and derived its interest mainly from the fact that it concerned their new friend.",
"He is the rich man of this neighborhood.",
"Then I knew that she loved me, and my secret broke out against my will.",
"Then comes the application of the power thus generated.",
"But for them our task would have been much easier.",
"But this road seemed alive again.",
"We count all friends, who are ready with their gold at need.",
"The appeal which was made, more with the voice and manner, than in the words, had its effect.",
"Of these letters, which would form an important chapter in political science, no entire copy, I have been told, is to be found in this country.",
"This was an easy task.",
"And what was I to gain by all this?",
"Why should he not be alive?",
"What broke it?",
"Whom have I to account for besides?",
"Fly, then!",
"But I doubt whether they will gain any advantage by doing so.",
"We are now on a most interesting topic.",
"But it is an impossible task.",
"In general appearance she seemed to be the opposite of her husband in every way.",
"He has told me everything, and I know that it is impossible for him to tell a lie.",
"I had some money, and there was a house with a piece of land for sale near the town.",
"She told me, in fact, that she did not believe she could have written it had it not been for my assistance.",
"A grand career would open before me.",
"I required more than speed in a case like that.",
"We never touch on these points, unless we are asked questions upon them.",
"We accepted the latter proposal.",
"The troops were brought immediately into line and charged up the bank.",
"The battle at once became general.",
"In the camp, or on the battle field, she was ever near him.",
"As every boy has read of the visit of this good man, only a brief mention of so important an event is necessary.",
"They had become the text of his life.",
"He was filled with a new confidence.",
"She broke off in her speech.",
"She broke off.",
"Is there anywhere else in the world, I wonder?",
"Besides, I wanted to get away.",
"I accepted.",
"She broke in at once.",
"He had come into touch with something which he could not understand.",
"She accepted his terms.",
"It was late in the afternoon before she dropped him at his rooms.",
"It was impossible!",
"I never meant to touch that money.",
"There it goes, all his great offering to me!",
"In answer to his first question, we told him that we had business to discuss.",
"I mean gold.",
"To pull up at such a moment was difficult.",
"Panel, I think I can guess what has happened.",
"Panel continued.",
"Pull it off?",
"The editor considered matters for a brief moment.",
"How was he going to set about this difficult task?",
"I want to know who its original owner was.",
"I thought at double extra speed just then.",
"He realized he was on dangerous ground.",
"Several times this was repeated.",
"The place was well filled.",
"But which way should I fly?",
"It will be found impossible to separate the music of his words from the music of the thought which takes shape in their sound.",
"They touch each other.",
"The first turning away from the easy, natural flow of my life occurred in an early spring.",
"Now again they were turning.",
"The voice of the old woman broke.",
"The party broke up.",
"As might be expected, I got no good from this reading, but the reverse.",
"She remained with him for a few minutes, then left the room, turning the key in the door.",
"I would give something to see that letter, to know exactly how he stands.",
"It is very good of him to come to my assistance.",
"No, no, do not come near me, do not touch me!",
"She thought it impossible.",
"And he also said that nothing to him was impossible.",
"And besides, said they, if we get into the way, what matter is it which way we get in?",
"It has been a severe winter, but now that is all past.",
"Besides, why should he make such an attempt?",
"These were filled in at the moment of leaving.",
"It was not in his rooms, however, that the meeting was to take place.",
"They set forth the situation.",
"But it was impossible to wait until that hour.",
"They set forth.",
"He offered us the use of his rooms.",
"This offer was accepted.",
"In broad day.",
"Suddenly it became impossible to do so.",
"No victory is possible.",
"A nation does not pull up short.",
"After victory, we will see.",
"Other matters had been decided, but these were not recorded.",
"Another detail.",
"Our appeal had ended by being heard.",
"Their position, to all appearance strong, was not so in reality.",
"He broke it.",
"I begin the battle therefore.",
"His mind was filled with his wife and children.",
"It was impossible to determine what sort of animals they were, but he was quite sure they were not dangerous.",
"This was repeated daily for weeks.",
"Good speed, good man.",
"If, then, we would come in touch with it we must meet it on its own ground.",
"It is not difficult sometimes to drop out of life while yet alive.",
"To learn more was for a time impossible.",
"The visit was a brief one.",
"He realized the situation in a moment.",
"One likes to see almost anything done well.",
"That was impossible.",
"But let us come back to our original topic of conversation.",
"Various accounts.",
"I might have repeated the offer and accepted the bet over and over again, so popular was it.",
"The loss of a brief to him is almost like the loss of an eye.",
"But it was impossible to do other than I did.",
"I asked when they thought I ought to put in an appearance.",
"He went forth on his mission, and saw a woman coming towards him with a baby.",
"I shall give this case, therefore, more in detail than I otherwise should.",
"He was told that that was impossible, as I could not come to him, nor could he go to me.",
"I will mention a few more names, and then close another chapter of my memory.",
"It was for sale at a price I thought then I should never be able to pay.",
"But what is the real meaning of the battle?",
"This is the secret of the battle of life.",
"He left the kitchen and reached his own room.",
"A touch might throw it out of position and drop him like a shot.",
"That evening he made his first appearance in public as a real professional.",
"He put on full speed.",
"In every detail!",
"As far in the background as the teachers can keep them.",
"If many of these things have been taken from the home, they have only been taken that they may, as it were, be carried back and forth between the home and the school.",
"The other afternoon I stopped in during the story hour to visit a room in the school of my neighborhood.",
"Why discuss, when they cannot act?",
"I maintain my rights, and make no resistance!",
"They were not to wait anywhere for her but to go right along.",
"Meanwhile she must avoid worry as much as possible.",
"She moved, and he realized he could not let her go thus.",
"It seemed unlikely.",
"It was essential to maintain as straight a line as possible.",
"Besides, it will soon be too dark to go on.",
"But we did mind very strongly, and said so.",
"The church is well worth a visit, being very old and of interesting appearance.",
"For reasons of his own he was fighting her battle.",
"West repeated the question.",
"She had been dead and was alive again.",
"It was impossible to tell yet whether he would live or die, but for some days at least it would not be safe to move him.",
"Never had she seen anything so grand.",
"He follows a straight enough line.",
"There were other problems that made the situation impossible.",
"All he had to do was to achieve the impossible.",
"A woman comes to the rooms of a friend.",
"I could trust only to the touch.",
"Before coming I had planned what to do.",
"My voice broke.",
"And certain it is that I have no wish to say the final word on any topic.",
"One is necessary to the other, and they often shift places.",
"Man is the result of cause and effect, and the causes are to a degree in our hands.",
"He knew that, when he had accepted this position of power, he also took on a responsibility.",
"What a grand guy he was!",
"Literature is at once the cause and the effect of social progress.",
"Not with my hand, but heart, which broke her heart.",
"Well, nothing but words will come of it, and words are dangerous.",
"Her secret knowledge that he knew her secret was more dangerous to him than anything that he had found out could be dangerous to her.",
"I only gain a little here and there.",
"Who knows which of us will be alive tomorrow morning?",
"He must know all that they know, and his own art besides.",
"It is alive.",
"From which follows one result.",
"What broke them up?",
"Impossible that they could be true.",
"The reason seemed to be that she never went anywhere.",
"They were individuals and alive.",
"She accepted it as a reason.",
"She gave me all the extra work to do that she could think of, apparently to keep me from helping my wife in the kitchen.",
"We used to get together every time we had a chance and talk about freedom.",
"We thought that as others, here and there, all through the neighborhood, were going, we would make trial of it.",
"It was such a warm night that they did not want to move on out of the water, and would not start, either, until they got ready.",
"Against this decision there was no appeal.",
"But, this is losing time.",
"Both had grown old, not only in fact, but in appearance.",
"Cool in summer, and warm in winter.",
"See, they fly away, away!",
"So he had planned.",
"Anyway, he accepted it.",
"Really, there is no house within reasonable walking distance.",
"If she is anywhere near, she will be sure to hear the dog.",
"But it is impossible.",
"Besides, I use it.",
"The world, the beautiful world, was gay in gold and green.",
"Besides she might not have wanted to.",
"But it feels as if our fine weather were over.",
"Impossible, if he loved her.",
"There was no light in the house anywhere.",
"Besides, there was the matter of the marriage.",
"Every day he filled as full of work as possible.",
"I think he is going to pull through.",
"Take gold, for instance!",
"Hence the relationship between crime and progress.",
"Meanwhile, was not the jury ever going to set the poor man free?",
"Had its owner been into that room recently?",
"He realized the possibility of various answers to these questions.",
"I could not find it anywhere.",
"Therefore we made but little progress.",
"I could never understand why, when one is above him, he stands and looks.",
"Gold might be more successful.",
"I set forth, therefore, towards evening.",
"No break anywhere.",
"But there was no appeal.",
"Then the fire broke out and we had to stand back.",
"But it was not her assistance that he wanted so much as it was her love.",
"But at last there was progress.",
"The sense of his loss was coming back upon him very strongly.",
"He thought he had just bought his freedom, and that he need not go.",
"He knew that sleep was dangerous.",
"But it might be many hours before assistance would come.",
"Causes of it.",
"Smoking has gone out.",
"There is a certain association of ideas in my mind upon that subject, by which I am strongly affected.",
"Then she broke down.",
"His heart beat strongly.",
"How impossible he always made it!",
"Somehow he made it impossible.",
"The greater resistance calls forth a greater action of the muscle.",
"Hence it is added to many articles of food.",
"Light helps the sense of taste.",
"Make a firm pull for a moment.",
"But what a reverse was here!",
"The present one was, however, the reverse.",
"She could no longer move without assistance.",
"Resistance was impossible.",
"Where he looks, all things fly into their places.",
"He must touch and taste of everything, and know every secret.",
"He knew not a soul in the house nor in the neighborhood.",
"Come closer to me and warm me!",
"So I turned short and went away, and in turning I looked again at the wall, and I could see no end to it.",
"I must be brief.",
"I should be easier when I had made one direct application.",
"Can fly to no other protection.",
"No other protection to fly to but his.",
"Here follows a copy of her letter.",
"All was still and warm.",
"He did not see how they could either turn out or stop themselves at that speed.",
"But it did not fly open.",
"He tried hard, but made little progress.",
"The man broke into a run.",
"She was just and cold and severe.",
"And that impossible dress!",
"In a few days I will reflect upon it.",
"Be reasonable, my child, and run away.",
"It really would be quite impossible to describe the wonderful things he showed them.",
"In brief, the year without me cannot stand.",
"Speak, and be brief.",
"Now, by this gold, I will.",
"Hence with him!",
"Be brief.",
"Now, be brief.",
"Go, go hence in peace.",
"They all realized this.",
"I believe the reverse.",
"He is a great man working at a great task.",
"Fear filled her heart.",
"Travel of any sort seemed impossible.",
"Seeing him down, the others broke and ran, but one had a shot at me.",
"How to gain her to my wish I cannot tell.",
"So numerous was this fair company that I have lost count of their numbers.",
"Then he returned to the battle.",
"Which last was putting it pretty strongly, even for the time, the place, and the girl.",
"I got it all planned out.",
"That dog he likes me, he does.",
"At this she came forth.",
"Too dangerous.",
"But this was impossible.",
"But he could see nothing to eat anywhere, and still less to drink.",
"We will pull on to the end when we have finished with him, but not a minute too soon.",
"If he helps us, we will help him.",
"Their chapter has been closed.",
"And it would have been such an interesting task, too.",
"See the trouble they took to achieve it.",
"No, I have not followed the accounts.",
"But if I have, I do not feel in a position to discuss them.",
"There is something that makes it impossible, now and always.",
"After that date he was never seen, alive or dead, by any person who knew him and was able to identify him.",
"Hence the name of his school.",
"He was the most human of teachers.",
"Where else at that period could they have found such teachers?",
"Then what follows?",
"A certain number always put in a regular appearance.",
"Today it has a large appearance.",
"It is neither a high nor a low, but an absolutely broad church.",
"There is somewhat of the student, and somewhat of the college professor in his appearance.",
"This is a tiny building, and appears to stand in a dangerous region.",
"Going out of warm rooms into the night air.",
"Rather dangerous.",
"First change in diet.",
"Their progress in learning to stand.",
"They are too warm.",
"Heat of our rooms.",
"Sense of touch.",
"Besides, if this is a rule, it is one which nobody follows.",
"Dark rooms.",
"The grand rule on this point is, to wear as little dress during sleep as possible.",
"Did they sleep in a cold or warm room?",
"To make a long story short, the company broke up and returned to the more important concerns of the election.",
"The appeal must come from within.",
"Suppose it should break in turning out!",
"He broke down all at once.",
"It shall not be repeated.",
"It is the turning point in his life and he knows it.",
"But the progress of development was slow.",
"Hence social life was free.",
"He was a most severe judge of himself, as well as others.",
"In this way, I went along, saying to myself, I will ask something in the next shop.",
"I accepted the proposal, and took my leave.",
"I tried to do it again, but it was impossible.",
"I will give it in detail, as women like to have stories told.",
"Besides, ought I not to speak to him first?",
"Other eyes were on the girl besides those of her mother.",
"There are certain articles thought to be especially dangerous.",
"As to the manner in which this service has been performed, it is impossible to speak very highly.",
"The next year stands for the coming time.",
"So go forth to the world, to the good report and the evil!",
"The progress of such an idea is from film to form.",
"Meanwhile, be a good girl.",
"This last is the point where old age starts from.",
"Dangerous word!",
"A man had been observed leaving the house, and his appearance had been noted.",
"Need we wonder that his progress was slow?",
"The technical problems were even more difficult.",
"What the future will bring forth we do not know.",
"But of this further mention will be made in a subsequent chapter.",
"I decided at once to visit every family in the neighborhood.",
"It now became apparent that a severe financial pressure was upon us.",
"The house was filled as usual.",
"And during the first round the work was planned for the winter campaign.",
"He has a clear head and a warm heart.",
"As reference has been made to the first named in a former chapter, it need not be repeated in this connection.",
"Have to drive up in a village fly.",
"Do they not fly by night?",
"A true friend of man, almost the only friend of human progress.",
"The meeting follows.",
"I get paid for news at my shop.",
"There she stands, quite still.",
"We are losing time.",
"He cannot be severe.",
"She will be sure to ask to see the accounts.",
"Let them appeal.",
"He stands still.",
"The others pull him back.",
"Some one had said she had accepted him.",
"No appeal?",
"That is impossible!",
"How many rooms does it contain?",
"Nothing could be more reasonable than this demand.",
"The fly will be here directly.",
"Well, well, he means well, all the same, so one must not be severe.",
"Why should great results spring from such small causes?",
"Not understanding this, I repeated my question.",
"No one can have rooms kept for him.",
"Their rooms will not be charged for, but they will do well to give the same as they would have paid at an hotel.",
"Of these I will speak at length in the next chapter.",
"Whatever these songs describe is true to that life.",
"Besides what I had many years ago?",
"He had as much as charged her with this in saying to her, many months before, that she even then knew something she was keeping from him.",
"I shall leave them a record and an appeal.",
"No more than a touch is necessary.",
"To begin with, he was not so much in the shop.",
"A similar test for the future would then be impossible.",
"He did not return home nor to the shop.",
"It was different at the shop.",
"All this, however, was accepted as the established order of things.",
"He is as responsible for turning away from it, or turning towards it, as he is for any of his actions.",
"Just consider, for a moment, the strain of detail.",
"He further agreed that if he were alive at the end of that time, he would continue on.",
"Nothing stands alone.",
"I gave a pull.",
"It was a long pull and a strong pull.",
"This was repeated many times.",
"Besides, how did I know that it was the right stuff?",
"It was the only way she could get anywhere.",
"This woman stands for the town itself.",
"Are all teachers?",
"But of these things we cannot now speak in detail.",
"But I had never been on a progress.",
"He filled the eyes of any woman, yes, and of any man.",
"I alone remain alive of those men.",
"Never a mention of losing herself.",
"He ought to have expressed himself more strongly against them.",
"I cannot discuss the matter with my father.",
"As I say, however, he does not strike me as dangerous.",
"Even an added hour of freedom was worth having.",
"He went forth with us to the wall.",
"To shop?",
"It was a regular game of golf for us.",
"It is accepted.",
"And there is, at least, a warm heart about it somewhere.",
"He had the touch of names, I think.",
"Argument is impossible.",
"I made sure, besides, to have died first.",
"Besides, my father will not perhaps be long here.",
"So much said, I come with guilty speed to what more immediately concerns myself.",
"It is impossible I should answer anybody the way they should be.",
"And was that last chapter worth the trouble it cost?",
"A shop.",
"Hot, warm.",
"But what is he besides?",
"But the effect of failure upon my own mind has been just the reverse of this.",
"Meanwhile, the children in the house had been making themselves happy also in their manner.",
"I took the boy home with me and put him in the kitchen.",
"I then felt that my life was bad, and that it was impossible to live in that manner.",
"And these are the people to whose assistance I go.",
"Every one likes to think that money is only a medium of exchange for labor.",
"We will exchange our products through the medium of money, and the money of each one of us represents our labor.",
"Money represents labor.",
"He has taken up smoking within my memory.",
"These are my chief reasons for offering this volume to the public.",
"These rooms were all full.",
"But there were signs of progress.",
"Eye cases are unfortunately very numerous.",
"The usual appearance is that of a small house built on at the end of a larger one."],

["Thus, I received a fresh surprise.",
"Could she be afraid of me?",
"But, so far as the light showed, I saw nothing unusual.",
"Even now, the idea is strange and terrible to me.",
"I was not particularly afraid.",
"I did not attempt to prove it.",
"I grew to wondering, how much longer the house would stand.",
"Then, I saw the sun.",
"The sun was very close to me, now.",
"What reason to keep us apart?",
"Sometimes the heat was terrible.",
"We met all our friends, and heard every language under the sun.",
"He wanted too to choose his seat.",
"Shops, trading at small.",
"One might as well say, I prefer to fight in battle by myself!",
"We cannot see it, or touch it, or handle it.",
"This is the real difference between students at the same school or university.",
"With all this demand, the business man still stands largely in a class by himself, a class apart from the great leaders of the world.",
"Is it merely a way of making money?",
"It has a false bottom.",
"We had moved a little back, and had come to another seat.",
"My father was busy over some papers near the window.",
"There was no further entry.",
"I can hardly believe that he is afraid.",
"Keep in company and watch for signals.",
"Otherwise he showed no sign of surprise.",
"Being busy from morning until night we knew but little of what was about us.",
"My idea was that the island would keep the men busy for a while.",
"As I look back on it now, the period seems to me to be one of merely potential trouble.",
"Quite proper.",
"I had plenty of time to run away.",
"Far out to sea we could make out the sun on the water.",
"He pointed under foot.",
"The officer was not long dead.",
"When we arrived, we found everything in order.",
"Mine, at least, will soon be broken.",
"How long this era continued no man can tell.",
"May not this be the new era that is about opening in the progress of all things?",
"Mix well.",
"Season and mix together.",
"Mix all well.",
"In cool weather it keeps him warm.",
"As for weather, dark days and sun days are the same to him.",
"The old man fell now into his seat, and I took the glass from him.",
"They work cheap.",
"Of course when he suggested a drink, he assumed the responsibility of paying for it.",
"These he could carry out elsewhere.",
"Many, however, would prefer their stock straight.",
"His strength gave way.",
"It was not merely the disease, but the individual he treated.",
"He had arrived at the right moment, as he always did.",
"I was afraid.",
"So unusual.",
"They arrived just at the same time that I did.",
"This decided him to have a short rest, and then go and surprise her with a visit.",
"I arrived early this morning.",
"He went to his club, there to try and pass the time until the evening.",
"Here she soon found a seat.",
"Now, she assumed the worst!",
"He put up his stick.",
"At this moment he arrived.",
"He was more welcome than ever now.",
"Some were afraid.",
"They were afraid to pass it.",
"They were afraid the people would kill them.",
"She was busy all the time.",
"The sun sets.",
"Yet it lies before me.",
"I feel so like an odd stick.",
"He looked up at an unusual sound.",
"When the sun set last night it was still winter.",
"Odd books have been put in my way.",
"But he had not the strength to carry out his purpose.",
"I am quite broken down and brought low.",
"It was no easy task to perform.",
"A terrible moment followed.",
"There was plenty of work for him to do.",
"Just then a terrible thing happened.",
"All those who followed, as they arrived on the spot, did the same.",
"So begins the battle.",
"Well, I, for one, am not afraid to be open and speak my mind.",
"Of that I had thought little, merely taking care that the man did not see me.",
"That explains it all.",
"He must see that everything was put in proper shape in the event of his death.",
"We never seem to be able to do anything in proper style.",
"She could afford to wait.",
"Where is the soul of the sun?",
"Meanwhile, many of those already there were wondering why they came and how they could get home.",
"I then should make love elsewhere.",
"I am not in the least busy now.",
"And, all the while, I was afraid of it, I think.",
"The room seemed less comfortable than he had ever known it.",
"She was afraid of him.",
"In both cases we must supply what the children need.",
"The change was not welcome to all teachers.",
"The road generally runs into a main road with shops and traffic.",
"Then welcome reaction began.",
"How was the cost to be shared between the mother country and themselves?",
"And this was an unusual fight, too.",
"This was an easier day, for he went slow, as if seeking for something.",
"The odd thing was that at that moment I did not fear for myself.",
"It was odd to see the way in which her presence affected each of us.",
"The man was fairly broken down.",
"Was it really only yesterday that she had broken it?",
"Each man carried a heavy club.",
"She had never been one of those who are afraid of death.",
"No one had accused her, or brought before her judge the things that were against her.",
"It was winter, and snow was on the ground.",
"Yet she was not afraid.",
"The child declared that she was not at all afraid.",
"Was she afraid that some one might hear?",
"They were too far off for her to see clearly, but many came each apart, one figure only at a time.",
"When he keeps us from them, it is for love.",
"Is there any one that is not afraid to die?",
"I have always lived a very busy life.",
"It is to welcome those that are coming, and tell them.",
"There will be plenty of fun.",
"After a while I began to feel my strength come back.",
"The woman was taken by surprise.",
"They looked at me with wondering eyes.",
"And I was very busy with my figures, interested, feeling no room in my mind for any other thought.",
"My father returned to his seat.",
"Some may go on together in this latter course, but be wide apart in the standards they reach in it.",
"That explains it.",
"I say found myself, because really it was a surprise to me.",
"That meant a lot of money, a fat lot of money.",
"Even since the publication of that book, changes have been made.",
"However, these statements are hardly accurate.",
"They found the office a busy place.",
"I think the true explanation is easily arrived at.",
"None of them can ride.",
"As this had been the plan all along, she looked up at him in surprise, not knowing, of course, that he had been thinking of putting off the fixed time.",
"To do this he must, first of all, keep his lines of supply safe.",
"Night is not terrible of itself.",
"Yes, there was food, plenty.",
"She took up some work and tried to busy her hands.",
"Of what am I accused?",
"Nothing easier to prove than that.",
"She keeps house for me and I am trying to show her all the love I can but it seems to have no effect upon her.",
"Time will prove the new love.",
"That period of development has arrived.",
"The evil of our age is that its values are all false.",
"He had failed in his first surprise attack, and without surprise to help him now he was gone.",
"Kind of hard on his skin, the sun, maybe.",
"And ride straight.",
"That he should have done all this merely to focus all eyes upon him, and particularly the eyes of a girl, did not occur to anyone.",
"She dropped one hand on the edge of the table.",
"The girl merely looked at him.",
"He was afraid.",
"But at her appearance all talk was broken off.",
"But she was beginning to be afraid.",
"The little handle at the side fell out, but suddenly he stopped me.",
"And it was cheap at the price.",
"Again his attention was directed to the new girl.",
"But there was now plenty of food.",
"They held this up toward the sun.",
"They had no guns.",
"There was snow on the ground.",
"So he pointed the wrong way.",
"He wanted all the children to be afraid of him.",
"The odd little man came in.",
"Then they were not so much afraid.",
"He held it in the sun.",
"They were more afraid of him than ever.",
"The men who made these guns put little pictures on them.",
"He was afraid that the men in it would give up.",
"But he was not afraid of trouble.",
"For months there was no sun at all.",
"The sun did not rise any more.",
"He fixed one of these so it would catch the light of the sun.",
"He wanted to make a club.",
"He cannot be killed with a club.",
"He was afraid that he would hurt his eyes.",
"An accurate one?",
"Moreover be brief.",
"What was the last element discovered, and by whom?",
"May they be broken in pieces!",
"Moreover, business did call.",
"Looked as if she was afraid of him.",
"He said I must stick to him because I could not go back.",
"Moreover, the house was comfortable.",
"Here, too, as in political economy, the supply answers to the demand.",
"An odd thing to think of then and there!",
"Something terrible.",
"The stars looked cold.",
"I felt afraid, even with this strong man, for I did not know where I was going.",
"Her strength was gone.",
"Here it lies before me now.",
"So much food, air, protection given produce so much strength.",
"And there is plenty of need of both.",
"Women fight for a place in the sun for those who hold right above might.",
"Quickly, there being no red tape, the need begins to be met.",
"But that is merely a guess.",
"Every woman who keeps herself in condition is making a war saving.",
"Perhaps we have assumed that men can look out for themselves.",
"He would find that he had lost one and that he had left his stick behind.",
"Moreover, the door was closed as though customers were not expected.",
"A lawyer will prove that black is white if he is paid for it.",
"What more could they expect us to prove?",
"He started with surprise, read the note through again, then turned round as though in search of the writer.",
"I was the president of the club and felt responsible.",
"I knew my business as president of this club.",
"And when he talks, listen and remember what he says.",
"But had I strength to speak that word?",
"I was early in my seat.",
"What did I care for the snow?",
"The surprise was complete.",
"She was afraid to risk it.",
"Meanwhile, my own mind had been busy.",
"I would join her, and find out if she had heard.",
"It was very short and contained but one surprise.",
"This meant that the lower part had been carried away, broken.",
"She was like a snow woman and her touch was ice itself.",
"For the first time in his life, it was broken.",
"The club he placed on end against a tree.",
"For he knew what a club meant!",
"He was not afraid, but he was not ready to go.",
"He wanted to lie down in the snow.",
"But we are comfortable now, and warm.",
"To his surprise the man did not pick up a stick or a club.",
"The snow was not so deep on the ice of the river.",
"The snow grew heavy under her feet again.",
"His strength was gone.",
"I see that by the snow.",
"All that I know by the snow.",
"Others were covered with snow.",
"Nearly all of his old strength had returned to him now.",
"Both were seeking food, and as there was no food between them to fight over, each went his own way.",
"All the strength was gone from his body.",
"Each time he brought the club.",
"It was a different looking club now.",
"The club was washed clean.",
"Another brother was pointed to him.",
"His brother, who had gone to get a drink, was afraid, and ran away.",
"When he arrived he felt that it was heavy.",
"The man heard the conversation of the dogs, and went and got a stick.",
"They pointed out the place.",
"They recognize that they need us, as we have need of them.",
"They have done so at a terrible price.",
"It would be such fun to surprise him too, by all at once reading him something!",
"They wanted stuff to shape and fashion into things, and join into other things.",
"I can afford it very well.",
"I saw in a moment what the boy was afraid of.",
"A tour of the house showed me, moreover, that it had been built with the same possibility in view.",
"We soon found what we were seeking.",
"It is a terrible risk to run.",
"And here, for the first time, I found myself welcome.",
"Moreover, he is a dangerous man.",
"They are too vast and complex for that.",
"Yet it is often assumed that it does.",
"There will come a term to this phase of evolution.",
"That completed it.",
"That estimate was found to be approximately accurate.",
"But bad as was the route the men had followed during the night, it was easy as compared with the position they had set out to carry.",
"She has done worse elsewhere.",
"The village has played us false!",
"It was terrible to watch him and seem to hear such words.",
"My request was an unusual one.",
"In an hour it would be dark, the beginning of the long northern night.",
"But now that all is over it appears to me like some terrible dream.",
"What is the meaning of this terrible work?",
"He was afraid to continue.",
"From here I had pointed out to me the various features of the country.",
"We were to wait for the guns.",
"He asked where our guns were.",
"To my great surprise, we began to move.",
"Star arrived during the morning and took charge.",
"Also more guns and war material.",
"No one expected anything unusual.",
"But when we arrived we found that the emergency had already passed.",
"It was very clear and there had been great activity in the air on both sides all the morning.",
"The other officer had his own party.",
"Strange, as I recall that afternoon.",
"I have broken no law of the land.",
"I have arrived where I am today only for one reason.",
"My question was not a welcome one.",
"He pointed straight before him.",
"Believe me, I did not realize this little surprise would be waiting for us.",
"Something had been broken.",
"But I may be very busy in the office.",
"It is quite a terrible story.",
"I would recognize them anywhere.",
"She lived apart from her husband.",
"How busy those hands had been that morning!",
"During all that time their strength had been turned against themselves.",
"Thus they shared with each other what they respectively had.",
"He keeps that in the background.",
"Strength to live like men.",
"And strength to die.",
"He begins by giving them credit for whatever good there is in them.",
"I do not mean base false people.",
"This is a point open to a good deal of discussion from both sides.",
"His wife lies opposite him with others of his family.",
"We may well ask by what route he went, and to that question we shall get no certain answer.",
"He was successful in his request.",
"It was something unusual for her to receive a letter.",
"Find her and argue with her.",
"The boy looked at him in surprise.",
"There was no need to request their attention.",
"I suppose that is what his folks were afraid of.",
"I am afraid to look it over.",
"It would be rather fun to see his odd ways.",
"The streets, the shops, are left, but all old friends are gone.",
"He pointed to some of the cases in his books.",
"The business of each day begins with the reading of the rules, after which, the names are called over.",
"Instead, she determined to find a way to reach her goals elsewhere.",
"She even tried taking a different route to the station.",
"In time, she was able to afford her own house.",
"It was now several weeks since she had changed her route.",
"The news, however, was not welcome to all classes.",
"At this crisis the guns opened fire.",
"No one could leave the guns to bring up more shot.",
"There she and her children were always welcome.",
"Her sun went down while it was yet day.",
"By the time it was finished the company had arrived.",
"Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.",
"Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.",
"Here I am running away from my own home as if I were afraid of the police!",
"The country was here a little more broken.",
"The sun had just set.",
"It has been terrible.",
"I have been very busy, in my small way.",
"What does it matter if it is broken?",
"He looked round as if wondering whether the room was very hot.",
"She was afraid of her.",
"He looked up as if interested in the answer, but did not join in the conversation.",
"He turned and looked at her in assumed surprise.",
"I am just wondering.",
"Yet it was not all snow.",
"She was afraid of this man.",
"The time has now come for us to put forth our strength.",
"The time has gone by for merely asking for what we want.",
"The strength of his will made itself felt.",
"The sun had set long ago.",
"For the next few days I shall be busy.",
"He was rather afraid of these women.",
"They are afraid of nothing.",
"For a moment he did not seem to recognize them.",
"Where lies the body?",
"I am afraid!",
"Ride, then!",
"It seems to me as if I had always known a lot of what we are getting in these classes, though there is plenty of new stuff too.",
"And since nobody had anything else on for the evening, there was plenty of time for talk.",
"He could hardly believe, but he had one request to make.",
"And I want to join.",
"Anybody who appeared to have intelligence and interest was the more welcome.",
"They think enough to be afraid, but not enough to be sure of anything.",
"How did it happen that the church was busy with this and that and the other work?",
"Then we have accurate rules.",
"I was feeling fairly comfortable, and I could think out a plan now.",
"I think there is something terrible about this.",
"Hence the house was exposed to the elements on all sides.",
"But I must eat, I must drink, I must mix in society of some sort.",
"Put it by, and, when cold, take off all the fat.",
"As there are some people who prefer the outside cut, while others do not like it, the question as to their choice of this should be asked.",
"At the same time, plenty of exercise and clean water should be at their service.",
"Mix them together, and drink immediately.",
"And what do these names prove?",
"Go, then, false man!",
"For himself, he declared that he could not get enough alone to write a letter to a friend.",
"Does a child only begin to exist when it begins to think?",
"They are able to learn plenty still from him.",
"Welcome home!",
"The mother was very busy keeping an eye on them all.",
"They always asked us to join them in their games and we were very happy that they wanted our company.",
"But she could not help wondering why these people were trying to force the boys to live together.",
"He arrived in the middle of the night when nobody could see him.",
"She intended, therefore, to voice her request immediately.",
"This manner of being taken to a hospital seemed very odd to him.",
"And now how terrible it all looks!",
"Hold the stick down.",
"This came from all sides and all at once.",
"This gives them plenty of room to turn round in.",
"It was the greatest and most successful surprise of the war.",
"The guns are starting.",
"Never can I forget that terrible picture.",
"Thus would I argue within myself.",
"I tried to argue with him, but it was difficult to argue with a man when I did not know his language.",
"How busy they were!",
"I want to go into this thing fair and square, so I must get fixed up proper first.",
"While we were waiting for the time when we could afford to set up house together, another man came along.",
"The surprise is complete.",
"The country is covered with a deep snow.",
"This history explains many things.",
"Vast chain of being!",
"She begins, let all be still!",
"Perhaps we should not even find them, especially if we handle in such a way the present situation.",
"His strength of mind?",
"His liberal treatment of his friends?",
"He was all right, he declared, warm and comfortable, and wanted to rest.",
"To me he must know that he would be most welcome.",
"This time it is not merely my absence, if it ever were so.",
"There is a law which can be used against the members of a secret society with terrible effect.",
"She told us in a broken voice that her husband had been called up.",
"Civil war is always the most terrible thing which any land can have.",
"We can handle trouble.",
"Never before had she been afraid to look into herself.",
"No matter how hot the sun ever got there, she liked it.",
"It was indeed very comfortable there after that long hot ride.",
"That was a ride.",
"There seemed to be an unusual number of men on the dark streets.",
"He must stand apart from all others she knew.",
"There was need of his strong hands in many places, but he could not choose any one labor and stick by it for long.",
"He saw nothing unusual, heard nothing.",
"Have all of them get their guns!",
"What had seemed terrible began to feel natural.",
"It left me, and then I got a terrible pain in my side.",
"No, not me, but it keeps them away from me.",
"They are afraid.",
"That showed him to be an officer.",
"They were many, but wide apart.",
"How terrible for him to live it all over!",
"Her strength began to leave her now.",
"I had a short seat in one of the cars, through the night.",
"Once one of them came along and said something about there being room for him on my seat.",
"The girl said the rooms were let for shops.",
"I will recall the truth, and can do no more.",
"There must have been some unusual cause.",
"I was kept at the guns during the entire time of our watch.",
"My purpose is to keep the men busy, and then talk the situation over with them.",
"I believe I can handle them, with what help I have.",
"Yet at that they were too late, the advantage of surprise had failed them.",
"Besides, he had the documents to prove the truth of his story, he said, which he would spread before them a little later on.",
"I had not arrived at it before.",
"Then I got on a front seat to watch the fun.",
"He, too, pointed or seemed about to point.",
"He pointed to the floor.",
"It would be a surprise for her.",
"He looked where she pointed.",
"She was afraid!",
"One man alone held apart.",
"He was looking for something, seeking something!",
"But all her strength was gone.",
"This last request.",
"But, doctor, I got the surprise of my life.",
"The women need a few members there to stick up for them.",
"Life was not so simple and easy as she had thought, or was it true that the element of trouble was in her own mind.",
"I had to argue a long time to get them on him.",
"The sun was setting, and all had returned to the village.",
"Come along with me, and leave the rest to do as I have directed.",
"It was very terrible.",
"My heart was nearly broken, and I could stand no more.",
"Each one to do something for somebody, outside and apart from himself, every day of his life.",
"Then it keeps them at home.",
"I never wish to spend such a terrible hour again.",
"I think that she thought he would be more comfortable with them.",
"Soon they got quite close together, and I saw some shops.",
"He came to a terrible end, but for a long time no one knew anything about it.",
"On the other the ground and rock were broken away, and it was quite easy to get into it.",
"Then the sun seemed to come out and work for the people.",
"He must have arrived at his house by night.",
"What lies under them again, does not concern us just now.",
"There are plenty in nature quite as great, and greater.",
"Let me by a few words prove this statement.",
"Now what does its presence prove?",
"Here and there pieces stick out, obviously out of place.",
"Immediately everybody became busy.",
"We will each choose our colleagues.",
"That argument has a double edge.",
"Let us keep on, they would argue, with what we have.",
"Terms very liberal.",
"Little I knew of the terrible thing that was going to happen at camp the very next day.",
"And always he had a stick with him.",
"I saw he had a stick in his hand.",
"That was a busy week for the school boys and girls.",
"But what can I do if she does prove to be the right one?",
"They directed their course towards the sea side.",
"Nobody ever talks of marriage now.",
"Several times he has tried to walk with me when we met, and has often tried to see me home from church or elsewhere.",
"Their first move was, as it must be, to report their return to the officer in charge.",
"Some things they said were very odd.",
"There was a great deal to be said on both sides of the question.",
"As quickly, a choice of sides was forced on him.",
"Does the knowledge come so cheap, or at a price?",
"The writer was afraid of being caught.",
"Their whole supply.",
"There is a cheap way of living in large cities as well as an expensive one.",
"For all there were so many yet was not the net broken.",
"This is such a surprise!",
"But I prefer not to.",
"But I had to find her a seat, after she about asked me to.",
"It is afraid to sleep alone, to go alone.",
"On the level, of course, it was a different matter, but in broken country he more than kept up.",
"His own gun was far away, but guns were not what he wanted.",
"There was an odd change in the little man also, the moment his gun was in place.",
"I was afraid all the time.",
"Moreover it was a strange time of the evening.",
"And this was merely a beginning.",
"All his strength in his back and none in his head.",
"I knew that love is not found through seeking.",
"She was afraid I knew something.",
"And all the while they were watching him and wondering what was in his mind.",
"No stars, no stars again!",
"The sun!",
"And there was a terrible lot of work waiting for me this morning.",
"But she declared that one child was quite enough.",
"She had friends on many sides, it seemed.",
"But she pointed to her baby.",
"And that explains everything.",
"That, then, is the truth I was seeking.",
"How terrible!",
"Yet her loss did not surprise her.",
"What a terrible thing!",
"Or perhaps she had arrived just before he died.",
"But more serious trouble declared itself.",
"Between them they were reason, and health, and strength.",
"No one of the children had strength enough, time enough, or material enough to build the village alone, yet see how well and how quickly it is done when we all help!",
"He has broken the law in some way, and he has no work.",
"It will not prove well.",
"But I am glad I found her, though I was afraid.",
"Well, may she prove a happy wife to him!",
"Military law had been declared.",
"And so the terrible news was brought to us one morning that we were free.",
"He could afford to wait, as it would be some hours before another train would be in.",
"Odd, was it not?",
"It is too busy.",
"It was the first time he had broken his word with the people.",
"Our life has broken away from the past.",
"And the question seemed to be directed, not towards the bed, but behind it.",
"He probably knew what they were afraid to say to each other.",
"There was plenty of time.",
"He is terrible.",
"Then he turned the handle and opened the door.",
"And no one was afraid of him.",
"He was usually very accurate in details.",
"The night arrived.",
"What else may it generate?",
"I thought this a really unusual idea.",
"All day there were talks, most of them by scientists.",
"The first exercise was the most terrible one.",
"It is not to be expected from a more liberal people.",
"But how much greater means for such a purpose, would an alternative like this afford?",
"This is merely playing with them.",
"When we arrived, the water had just come.",
"I am afraid to think on that which I know I cannot avoid.",
"I seem to myself neither to gain nor lose strength.",
"I am afraid of thinking what I have lost.",
"I am afraid of a civil war.",
"This is a cheap place, full of cheap men.",
"I could no longer recall them.",
"If the connection is broken there is no action.",
"By the afternoon they were back again, and with them the stick.",
"Here is the story of a night surprise, as it was told me.",
"The little said was merely about writing.",
"What is more beautiful than vice!",
"In the course of the evening, the cards for the expected ball arrived, and were accepted.",
"What is false?",
"However, we shall argue on for ever.",
"See how comfortable I am.",
"Not to take part in politics means not to take sides.",
"But the testing time has now arrived.",
"Here we will be safe, with plenty of room, and plenty to eat and drink.",
"But the results were not accurate.",
"There would be plenty of time for him!",
"I cannot speak of all the plans and projects which we discussed, but at last one of them was carried out.",
"I looked at the man in surprise.",
"He then reviews his own situation, his calling and his work.",
"The officer was very civil, but told us it was not in his power to do otherwise.",
"Towards this place the party now directed their way.",
"And what was their request?",
"It cannot, like music, be shared with others.",
"I was forced to join them or be killed, and will have to go with them that night.",
"The company was more than half made up when he arrived.",
"His mind was busy with his own sad life.",
"The effect was terrible.",
"I judge by what lies behind, and I understand.",
"She looked at him in some surprise.",
"Over in this country we sometimes do things in an unusual way.",
"I am very busy.",
"He looked at me in cold surprise.",
"Stick at it.",
"They say that money talks.",
"I am going round to all the shops, and I am going to bring the clothes I buy away with me.",
"An hour before men had been busy within and without it, now not a soul was to be seen.",
"I prefer to put it this way.",
"To our surprise he accepted.",
"I can supply everything.",
"I accused them both.",
"The others certainly did not recognize him.",
"Some day he would prove it.",
"She was almost afraid of him.",
"The surprise had been too much for her.",
"There is one only which I can recall.",
"The day is far spent, the red sun is low over the west.",
"Make everything as comfortable as possible.",
"He knew it by the handle being broken near the end.",
"He had no right to be there, no right, to have seen her father in that terrible condition, that death in life.",
"I shall stick to my original proposal.",
"It so exactly describes him.",
"He looked at her with surprise.",
"He wants me to join him.",
"He looked at her with an air of surprise.",
"Come away, and prove my words.",
"The sun is set.",
"He pointed to the volume.",
"Both sides were afraid.",
"The officer gave the order to charge.",
"The officer!",
"Some began to throw down their guns and go away.",
"How many guns?",
"A surprise was possible.",
"This moment of surprise did not last long.",
"We have just arrived here.",
"I pointed them out to him.",
"It is terrible.",
"Did they know the accused?",
"At something terrible and lost to view.",
"His attention was thus directed to the interesting country which the paper would describe.",
"The diet pointed out, then, is to be continued until the second year.",
"The time when, and the manner in which the first set appear has been pointed out.",
"Even these terrible laws could not keep them away.",
"The government at home was kept busy at this time.",
"Welcome, bad boy.",
"Next day, though, he was a busy man.",
"It was the same way at this time when the snow was deep last year.",
"Still they are far apart.",
"The morning has broken.",
"I did not argue with him at all, for I knew be had the advantage of me.",
"He merely took her in his arms.",
"Furthermore, he told her when they would be married.",
"One thing, meaning much, she had done, which took from the man his strength.",
"Then came snow again, and the road showed next a straight white band across the water.",
"He was afraid to meet his wife.",
"He had declared himself.",
"Both her father and mother are below the grade which means the average of my own kind.",
"Having failed in this, he was next asked what, when they died, became of people who told lies.",
"He was not the man to be afraid of being asked where.",
"Others I could recall by the score, men of character and of no character.",
"I knew nothing of him, but seemed to recognize his features as those of one I had seen before.",
"He had written to her, and if his letter did not prove familiar terms, there was no meaning in language.",
"A doctor was accused of a terrible crime against a female patient.",
"The home is not yet completed.",
"Why should I be afraid?",
"It was broad and had a very long handle.",
"Now, however, they appeared to be quite clear of the town proper.",
"He found a double seat.",
"They are not what she ought to have, and, moreover, they are not what she wants.",
"Most significant of all, when they find it, they recognize it.",
"Thus our day begins.",
"I did not know which to join.",
"He lies about it, besides.",
"Not merely being in company with him.",
"Some more people bought copies.",
"I am very busy this morning.",
"He could not reason or argue.",
"But his voice carried an edge.",
"They got a right healthy fear of our guns.",
"With a big club.",
"When he got through, he was white as snow.",
"Let it ride.",
"Once he found her sitting on the snow, her back to a tree.",
"She was afraid of it.",
"They expected to find game sufficient to supply themselves and stock up for a few days.",
"Now he took plenty of time.",
"He moved forward and examined the snow.",
"But they could not afford this.",
"Why should he have to feel so long for that stick?",
"Directed by the officer, he made a fire and prepared for business.",
"It must have been a terrible hour.",
"Moreover, he knew she knew it.",
"Both were taken by surprise completely.",
"One officer and one man were picked up.",
"A signal was then made for assistance and help arrived within a couple of hours.",
"Both of them are so placed that they prefer her call not to be talked about.",
"But I will not be broken.",
"Yet hearing the word brought no great surprise.",
"And I was afraid that he would know it.",
"I was afraid of myself, and what I might do.",
"I was afraid that I could guess.",
"They both looked out, and one pointed several times.",
"He and I would never have arrived at the understanding we had reached now.",
"I would prefer it.",
"Women and men are never really far apart anyway, and women are largely what men have made them.",
"Even if a private strike an officer, the officer is not allowed to strike back.",
"Looking closer, he saw that it was directed to himself.",
"This news had met with mixed reactions.",
"Our plan has to be fair to both sides, not just one.",
"Now I have all of this power and strength that was brought about by my hate, and it is no longer of any value to me.",
"The one describes a thing as it is, the other describes it as it is felt.",
"I was not broken in upon by society.",
"They would welcome me back there, if all I hear about the present man is true.",
"I have been busy.",
"Besides, I think I recognize the man.",
"Usually I am not afraid of him.",
"This time he turned my strength to water.",
"If they prefer to turn on me, what matter?",
"Things are often where they are, simply because they happen to have got there, and not elsewhere.",
"He has had no share in the process by which the results were arrived at.",
"This may be true, or may be false.",
"Outside were to be seen the early stars.",
"It was too vast for her.",
"It was terrible for him to have to do.",
"She merely wanted to see them about something.",
"Much was said on both sides.",
"Sometimes they looked well and comfortable.",
"They declared that he was indeed a wonder.",
"It seemed to me that I felt that it contained something unusual, but I did not know what it was.",
"We were at the station in plenty of time.",
"Those were terrible days.",
"When a picture is ready, we send copies to all our agencies and set a day when they may release it, or give it to their customers to use.",
"Or his strength may have given out.",
"He looked at her with an expression of surprise.",
"Why should he do this, even if he could afford it?",
"And what was it she was saying as she pointed to a certain column?",
"I could never recall the details of anything after that.",
"A year had done a vast deal for the place.",
"This was the route by which the major had come.",
"Got a head like snow on rock.",
"The warm sun also held them to their task.",
"She has been extremely busy with accounts, papers, and letters.",
"Her brother still lies in a very critical state, and she will not leave him at present.",
"Now she had arrived.",
"The sun had long since set, and it was beginning to grow dark.",
"The many who have worked in the mine of knowledge are glad to welcome others who have different methods, and with them bring different ideas.",
"The doctor looked up from his writing in surprise.",
"She closed her eyes and tried to recall his face as he had looked up at her.",
"When he went walking he went early in the morning and directed his steps toward the country.",
"Been very busy though.",
"The surprise came when one looked into her eyes.",
"What an odd name!",
"There is plenty of time.",
"But it was a long time before she found the strength to pick it up.",
"It was the only thing she was afraid of.",
"What an odd thing for her mother to say!",
"He said such odd things.",
"We merely state it.",
"I have been afraid of it for some time.",
"She knew, though, that she was coming to the end of her strength.",
"This terrible strain must soon be over for her.",
"He was so odd!",
"She would order the fresh supply at once, that very afternoon, by the first mail.",
"She was a soul apart.",
"She was so happy that she was afraid to look at her own face in the glass.",
"Everybody else was in his proper place.",
"In every law office there is usually some one person who keeps the shop going.",
"It was, he told them, a most unusual and hence most important case.",
"It is clearly a proper question for them to pass upon.",
"It was done before she finished the request.",
"It was the members of the northern band that I met.",
"He keeps it secret, but mother knows, and so do I.",
"He was so slow that all his strength went for nothing.",
"But of late he has been terrible.",
"At first I saw nothing unusual there.",
"He was not only just, but liberal and kind.",
"His mind was elsewhere.",
"It was warm here, and he had a seat, and he knew of no other place in the city where he could be so comfortable.",
"But, true or false, it would not do to have the statement get before that jury.",
"It was hard to give them up, it was terrible, but it must be done.",
"He thought that the game was his at any rate, and that it was of no use for him to lose strength over it.",
"He had often thought to go over again the route taken on that day, but he had never found the time to do so.",
"It would be terrible, he thought, to lose it now, and be left alone in the dark.",
"They might as well have talked to the stars.",
"When they reached the face, they turned and looked at each other in surprise.",
"He was quite in his element.",
"If a man would rather be the machine, I cannot argue with him.",
"It was dark when we arrived.",
"I believe the people never ride.",
"I felt myself comfortable enough in the afternoon.",
"I have heard him say, that he is afraid of no dog.",
"It was only a place of strength.",
"There are plenty of ways.",
"A very simple experiment will prove this.",
"To all such it is a false friend.",
"The sense of contact is the most important element in touch.",
"Do not be afraid to act at once.",
"Give plenty of fresh air, but apply no cold to the body.",
"Hold a straight edge just below the level of the eyes.",
"The science which describes the structure of living things.",
"I should be very comfortable if it was not for thinking about home, so much.",
"But his business was sufficient for the supply of his wants and those of his family, and so he studied and worked on, and was content.",
"That took all my strength out.",
"He begins to feel the use of the past.",
"I am afraid I did the greater part of the talking.",
"Her strength returned.",
"She did not recognize him, but asked him to stay to dinner, saying that her husband would be glad to meet anybody who knew that old friend of his.",
"And they said it was well for him he had not given them time to join the body.",
"Describes her to great advantage.",
"She could prefer him to all the men she ever knew, if he would always be what he had been that day.",
"She keeps him at distance.",
"Indeed, my dear, I think I could prefer him to all the men I ever knew, were he but to be always what he has been this day.",
"The poor thing, she said, was afraid to lie alone.",
"But why, rather I should ask, will she fight against her stars?",
"I must therefore make my first effort by surprise.",
"How odd is that!",
"How terrible to go in there in the morning, when the sun was only just up, and not to come out again until it was quite down!",
"A surprise was waiting for him.",
"He pointed her out to the other children.",
"He was afraid to go in.",
"But all who are going have not arrived.",
"Just look at the snow!",
"And comfortable it certainly was.",
"But finally the sun came out, and the girls really set off on almost the last stage of their tour.",
"I am afraid of her.",
"Her strength seemed to be giving way.",
"What he saw was a great surprise to him.",
"Come, cheap for love, or buy for money.",
"I cannot speak, but welcome at a word.",
"What though it were once her own proper gift?",
"Welcome, my love!",
"Moreover, she made some severe conditions and put him on his good behavior.",
"Would I not come to give them welcome?",
"The only surprise I can feel is that this should be the first time of its being paid.",
"But, again, a surprise was in store for her.",
"This caused a great deal of surprise.",
"Then, when the sun had set, he got up and went home, feeling that all things were at peace.",
"And though she was afraid of him, he would not leave her until he had led her to her own house.",
"Either the land was not to their mind, or they had not the strength to hold it.",
"There was no welcome in his face.",
"The sun set.",
"But he could not afford to take any risks.",
"He would have given a great deal to go elsewhere.",
"The hand was broken.",
"Which was odd.",
"There was something very familiar about the figure of that fat man.",
"For the first time in his life, he felt how comfortable it was to have nothing on him but himself.",
"The professor, indeed, went further, and held that no man was forced to believe anything to be true, but what he could see, hear, taste, or handle.",
"Now, was not that very odd?",
"Both name and address were false.",
"Yet in many ways, of which it were well not to be particular, I arrived at the full story which I now tell.",
"That explains all.",
"But if the court itself had been a surprise, this was a positive wonder, a dream.",
"There was plenty of it.",
"I have to send in the completed notes not later than this day week, and it will be quite impossible.",
"Very odd.",
"They would be wondering what had become of me.",
"Nothing pointed has been said up to the present.",
"This was his mission, and he declared it by talking.",
"This is odd but quite true.",
"They are a liberal class, too.",
"Proper hour.",
"Proper season of the year.",
"What it indicates.",
"Children prefer the society of parents.",
"And how can they afford to have a separate dress for the night?",
"I generally prefer the latter.",
"But on this point, I have treated elsewhere.",
"As his strength increases, however, the latter direction will be less and less necessary.",
"But it is proper that I should here explain a little.",
"But of this, too, I have treated elsewhere.",
"My steps were sure, and could afford but a single result.",
"The hand was pointed straight before them.",
"The story begins with him and ends with him.",
"The day of the ball arrived.",
"His legislation, so far as he directed his mind to it, was very just.",
"It was a very unusual thing.",
"They had in view the public rights of the state in which all its members shared, and the rights of the members as parts of the whole, but they did not think of individuals as having rights independent of the state, or against the state.",
"I think therefore it will not be hard for me to make good what it was to prove.",
"I love, with all my heart, when people can prove what they say.",
"Not the least strength remained in my body.",
"It is, moreover, a topic with which few are familiar.",
"It has its seat in the region of sense rather than of thought.",
"Yes, odd things come out in ways that nobody thinks of.",
"But it is odd when it comes.",
"Strength comes ever to the strong.",
"There is no doubt when old age begins.",
"I am not, therefore, afraid to attack a new study.",
"He received an unusual education.",
"Thought was busy.",
"I had before given the subject special thought, but now it seemed to assume unusual importance.",
"The whole cast of the man indicated strength.",
"This done, I took my seat, for what more could I do.",
"Should he not be in some measure the judge of the situation before him when the trouble begins?",
"We are not afraid of what will happen, but of what may.",
"One should view nature with the setting sun.",
"The work begins.",
"Sound the recall!",
"In one respect she is a liberal.",
"I merely state the fact.",
"Still he was welcome.",
"He keeps time with his foot.",
"I watched the stars come out.",
"The contract lies before him.",
"The little strength she had suddenly left her.",
"This served him as a stick.",
"As he did so, he noted with surprise the power of his eyes.",
"The sun is setting.",
"They knew almost every hair of each of them, and I believe could have told which was which, in the dark, merely by their feel.",
"The day arrived.",
"He would not let it be a surprise to them.",
"At any rate, so far as I can see, the present is about the only comfortable time for a man to live in, that either ever has been or ever will be.",
"We had long talks together.",
"There is no chance of getting among our scientists in this way.",
"This made everything quite comfortable.",
"I used to be a little afraid of it at first.",
"False world!",
"That would be too terrible!",
"It is all very odd, certainly.",
"We have plenty of customers who go to church.",
"She loved plenty.",
"We arrived.",
"There is a vast deal yet for me to learn.",
"And inside of half an hour I was able to start myself and ride in.",
"And such a ride!",
"Never was there such a ride.",
"Day by day he was losing strength.",
"This new supply was too much.",
"This is the way of the sun.",
"He saw that life about him was cheap.",
"He describes a life he had lived.",
"For the present their connection was broken.",
"And he directed that something should be given her to eat.",
"And they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.",
"Yet I know and can prove it.",
"But I was afraid of the dark.",
"But I do know, and I can prove it.",
"He seemed to be too busy.",
"I was almost too afraid to sleep again.",
"But, on the table before me, there lies all that he had written of his latest and last story.",
"In the afternoon they sent to request us to go there.",
"I am always afraid.",
"Is that a false note?",
"This is the word which describes him.",
"They are as just as they are unusual.",
"He soon arrived at the house of his brother, who hardly knew him.",
"He thought the people had broken in.",
"It was not possible to remain and argue.",
"To my surprise, however, he did nothing of the sort.",
"If they are the members of the club, we are all right.",
"The sun continues to rise every day, to my growing wonder.",
"As to that question, I would deal, in so far as in me lies, fairly with all men.",
"All this is a very pointed instance.",
"What does it prove?",
"Is it on the proper side of the hospital?",
"It is odd to know nothing of all this.",
"The sun.",
"To ride.",
"The sun is hot.",
"It is not merely the bad book that does not last, and the good one that does.",
"But do not be afraid.",
"This was not so much of a surprise to the students as to me.",
"This went on until the time arrived for us to set out, and we started.",
"I thought she could not live for many hours, and was much afraid that they would think that I had killed her."],


// drill 22
["It may have been a few seconds before I was able to open them.",
"This died away, and, after that all was again quiet.",
"Then, it was quiet.",
"I was unable to see what it did.",
"For she has come to me out of the unknown.",
"I sat down.",
"By doing this, I am safe from observation from the window.",
"I have determined to repeat my experiment of last night.",
"I am not personally.",
"It was beautiful winter weather, very cold but no wind, and it was very good exercise.",
"We sat talking for some time.",
"Would any one be to blame?",
"I blame them only for the course they take towards each other.",
"She sat down.",
"And so they walked on, and I heard no more.",
"The wind died.",
"I walked to the edge.",
"It would have been impossible to reach the level of the upper country.",
"They did not project from the laboratory.",
"I caught them at every trial, and whenever we wanted them for food.",
"And the wind all died away!",
"He walked some distance without meeting with any of the places of interest of which he had heard so much.",
"They blame me for not talking out.",
"She sat with him as he examined his books.",
"They seemed so much interested in their talk that they went to the other end of the room and sat down there together.",
"He nearly got up once or twice and sat down again.",
"These things occasionally happen.",
"Yet she had certain mental characteristics which were entirely unlike most women.",
"But she did not like carrying out in detail her plans.",
"This was why she first went to see him at his flat.",
"She got up and walked on and on.",
"Then they both sat down on a seat.",
"They walked on and had nearly reached the station.",
"She sat down by him.",
"He was carrying a little black baby in his arms.",
"He turned and walked away.",
"She walked right up to the chief.",
"I am not weak.",
"They are to blame.",
"She became very weak.",
"All was quiet.",
"Be quiet now.",
"All was still and quiet.",
"She became sick again and very weak.",
"Now her eyes began to get weak, so that she could not see as well.",
"Her heart was very weak now and she had to rest often.",
"Nor do I entirely blame them.",
"Few cases came their way and no offices.",
"Our flat!",
"The quiet.",
"Nobody to blame.",
"Cross my heart.",
"No one found her out, and the wind could not reach her.",
"Surely there is no need to turn me out.",
"One can hardly blame him, poor fellow.",
"If they have the gun, thought I, they would surely believe that I intended to come back.",
"We found him to be a good fellow in camp, and excellent company.",
"There are men here who can draw their note for any amount.",
"I will dry up.",
"Surely she had heard that voice before!",
"He sat and considered the matter.",
"The only sound now was the wind up in the world above.",
"Certainly the wind was worse, the going was worse.",
"To push on and come out alive.",
"Fellow, what art?",
"Substantial and good!",
"Yes, sure, on such substantial security.",
"This stage direction is in no previous edition.",
"I have added this necessary direction which is in no former edition.",
"For the most part we have sat upon the bank our whole lives long.",
"Here was a moment he must give its full dramatic value.",
"So she walked along for about an hour and came to a little village, and after a few minutes she came to a large rock, and guess who she met?",
"He sat thus for a long while.",
"He sat quite still.",
"They were both rather cross.",
"Yet they had not any look of being recently purchased.",
"We account for this from the fact that the air is very dry.",
"The men agreed to work the claim on shares, the agreement being that they should work on shares by each receiving half of what they could get out.",
"News came in occasionally from the outside world.",
"So did his recent seconds and the late officials of the fight.",
"But in other subjects he was somewhat above the minimum.",
"I had come out to seek for trade, and it looked as if I were to find war.",
"Inside we made a division.",
"I was determined to make a good ending, since that was all now left to me.",
"I held my head high, and walked like a free man.",
"Then suddenly she sat up.",
"She tried to push past him, but her brother stopped her.",
"Was it possible that she personally had died?",
"She is a sweet little thing, though perhaps I should not say it.",
"To be alive was so sweet.",
"And the dream is sweet to lie here, and think that I am at peace.",
"And in each of these scenes I saw what I had never seen before.",
"There seemed no quiet streets, so far as I could make out, in the place.",
"Is there here, then, either beginning or ending?",
"I sat up.",
"Death is still and cool and sweet.",
"His wife sat by, giving him a quick look now and then, but saying nothing.",
"The great fellow was as weak as a child.",
"Go there and seek her, not here.",
"It seemed to me that it must be the middle of the night, as we all walked back.",
"Thus time passed on for several quiet days.",
"Sweet was the scene.",
"To teach them I should try.",
"She sat up.",
"There all was quiet.",
"No, the form is the same in all double offices.",
"Attention in reading the hours is a much more discussed and much more difficult mental effort.",
"I purchased the lot a long time ago.",
"A small beginning has led us to a great ending.",
"A man may be able to handle all the tools and not know their names.",
"Are they to cross the river?",
"All he needs is quiet.",
"Indeed, every fellow about here does!",
"He should probably not get a chance to see her again during the conflict.",
"He sat down to think.",
"Poor fellow!",
"But, unfortunately, he had not provided himself with the tools for the emergency.",
"I blame them because it was the truth.",
"Meanwhile, they will need good nursing.",
"I used to know a woman who never did a thing but look sweet.",
"Dress, look sweet.",
"They sat about in the center of the train, on the forward end of one of the cars.",
"He walked like a cat, and most likely he could see like a cat in the dark.",
"When in doubt, head into the wind.",
"Let the fellow go and she will forget him.",
"Treat both of us well.",
"The music, ending, left them face to face as he dropped his arm from about her.",
"He walked on.",
"He was apparently unable to complete his sentence.",
"And they sat down together in the room.",
"How was she able to strike so surely?",
"Heavy at heart, I sat down near by and watched them.",
"After all, I was not to blame.",
"It was a sad ending.",
"They went in and sat down.",
"The cause is not far to seek.",
"Other people spent their time in cutting down the trees.",
"But there was more water to cross.",
"But they soon reached dry ground.",
"Their friends heard them but could not cross the river to help them.",
"From the time when he was a boy he never sat down to rest without a book.",
"He had walked ahead of the rest of his men.",
"He sat down on a rock.",
"Poor men who had to stand in the rain could now keep themselves dry.",
"He was a great guide.",
"Sometimes the little fellow would go to sleep.",
"He walked many long miles to see about it.",
"One word may be strong, another weak.",
"Let us see in what different degrees.",
"The man who got down was the fellow who had gone through the car looking for the girl.",
"There was no wind.",
"At the last meeting, one fellow talked about the need for fresh blood.",
"He sat still.",
"If a number of others agreed with her, his retirement would be forced.",
"Another man got up and began to talk in a quiet voice.",
"Moreover, one could not trust the fellow.",
"They teach us how to die.",
"Put me down, old fellow.",
"The wind put out my light.",
"There was less of wind.",
"I looked far down the street, having walked to the corner of the church for the purpose.",
"They could take little account of the past, and were often unable to make any record for the future.",
"And are we to draw no light from history?",
"We fight to protect the freedom of our citizens.",
"Our winning of the war depends upon the full use of the energy of our entire people.",
"The government called them in the first hours of the conflict.",
"And in any case, women do not push men out, they push them up.",
"The savings made to support the war must needs, then, be made by the people, for the people.",
"Here they sat down and for some time talked over the events of the days gone by.",
"These, it seemed, were to be his seconds.",
"Instead, some walked a short distance to the east, others to the south and still others to the west.",
"He seems to be weak.",
"The man who keeps the place gave me a good description of him, though.",
"They reached the flat and found the front door open as they had left it.",
"Yesterday he was committed for trial.",
"It would be easily explained if this girl was present in the room or the house when the murder was committed.",
"Unable find where purchased.",
"She took on herself the blame for it all.",
"Then all was quiet and dark again.",
"Might I draw a hope from this?",
"A very quiet one.",
"Then I got up and walked away.",
"In the afternoon I sat in my window thinking.",
"Let me first express an opinion.",
"Here it was very quiet.",
"He was weak.",
"The baby was quiet.",
"Something came to him with that wind.",
"It was sweet.",
"He was sure now that there was something in the west wind.",
"Go, seek the large house.",
"All the people of the city came to draw water.",
"They all sat down.",
"He went to his mother, who asked him why he came to seek her.",
"It is not for that that we have no relations with it.",
"Property of private citizens.",
"Because they all draw.",
"For the moment he saw that he ought to learn to read, he ran to his mother, and asked her to teach him.",
"The summer was a very hot and dry one.",
"Small blame to him, say I, for that is just where my own eyes would have been.",
"I had no choice but to go to him, nor did my mother seek to hold me back.",
"He walked on for a moment, and then came close to me and caught my hand in his.",
"Surely such a thing as this could not really be!",
"But they did not even turn their heads.",
"Here is the document.",
"No scientific man could get beyond a working hypothesis.",
"She might surely think of him when she had nothing else to do!",
"She turned away, and walked down the street.",
"But the situation itself has at least this dramatic value, that it is different from what it seems.",
"It can only be with the ending of the commercial and military classes, as classes, that peace can come to the world.",
"The whole party remained quiet during the night and most of the next day.",
"My sweet sister!",
"Poor little fellow!",
"They were very sweet.",
"Finding that he would not listen to anything she could say, she sat down on a rock and left him to himself.",
"Yet surely she had not always been so!",
"Surely my position was a strange one.",
"But surely I need say no more.",
"The fellow was made up very much like him.",
"There were reasons, however, why she was unable to write, she added.",
"And we turned and walked home again.",
"Because it results in a draw.",
"What business have women to be trying to teach?",
"Things were pretty quiet at present on both sides, but greater activity was expected soon.",
"In normal times it must be a quiet place with little traffic.",
"And then all grew suddenly quiet again.",
"He was a fine fellow.",
"Meanwhile we should push on as soon as possible.",
"I walked back along the road towards the guns.",
"On the left, further west, it ran mostly on the flat and more in the open.",
"The time during which he could keep in the air for observation was, therefore, very limited.",
"I made him lie flat on the floor, and told him to keep as quiet as he could.",
"For miles round us the country was dead flat.",
"Surely there is more about me.",
"He would not blame me.",
"And it seems to me that I never knew the air to seem more fresh and sweet.",
"Surely he was coming.",
"We have kept it quiet long enough.",
"The mental effort needed for such a long speech said as much.",
"Do I blame her?",
"The reporters had missed nothing.",
"He walked straight into the post office.",
"My business is absolutely unknown.",
"What a sweet house it is.",
"What a sweet voice she had!",
"The men of his years had taken their degrees and were gone.",
"He was very much changed, poor fellow!",
"Some scenes occurred which seem to show that both sides were prepared for civil war.",
"The same country was the scene of the principal military career of each.",
"Not that I blame that.",
"Surely there is.",
"Surely, this was not done without a reason.",
"Yes, my friends, why seek the living among the dead?",
"Simple things will often teach us most.",
"One does not blame it, or call it wrong.",
"They are weak.",
"He is only their leader, their guide.",
"Surely it is so.",
"The wind failed.",
"Then, indeed, his days of peace and quiet were ended.",
"Then she referred to the letter again.",
"I cannot blame her, for she has really but little money to pay for her own support.",
"Send car by express.",
"Is the phrase classic?",
"We sat down.",
"They are sweet lines, and upon a sweet picture.",
"I never thought an evil or a weak thought in my life.",
"I have not had such a quiet half hour to sit down to a quiet letter for many years.",
"It has been such a treat!",
"The still small voice is surely to be found there, if anywhere.",
"She walked by and did not look his way, as usual.",
"She could feel it as she walked by.",
"But he had no such map.",
"Everything is quiet.",
"For a while all was quiet.",
"She would have continued to teach me, but she has not time, for she has a little baby of her own now, and that is the reason I came to school.",
"Sweet little red feet!",
"Then she walked on.",
"I am to see no relations.",
"He walked past her and closed the door, which she happened to have left open.",
"At times this man had the power of moving her, and she was afraid of allowing him to exercise it.",
"He went to the table and sat down.",
"The weak blue eyes looked into the strong face and read nothing there.",
"Then she sat down.",
"They treat me just the same.",
"At first I thought that was no more than a description of his particular case, because I knew how true it was.",
"And often the boss thinks he wants nothing bigger than a few more things.",
"Otherwise, all that had been learned would surely be lost.",
"The church has built itself up out of the community, and for the most part it puts very little back.",
"Study the people and their tools.",
"We put down the gas, and sat watching her.",
"No, my good fellow.",
"Not more of these should be purchased at a time than are likely to be used in the course of a month.",
"It should be kept in a dry place.",
"This should be kept in a cool dry place.",
"It will remain good some time, if kept in a dry place.",
"This will remain good some time, if kept in a dry place.",
"We shall give the principal causes, and the treatment to be followed in each case.",
"He has, however, nothing of his dramatic power.",
"Now for a description of the bed.",
"See how the papers treat them!",
"She wanted the child to thank him for receiving her into his house.",
"Then all was quiet for a time.",
"It was not with their previous knowledge or approval.",
"The government has offered help to the banks, but they do not need it yet.",
"A few seconds later came a new sound.",
"At length a strong division arrived to support us.",
"I remained still for several minutes, feeling quite sick and unable to get up.",
"Room after room was filled with the victims of the conflict.",
"Both sides showed the greatest confidence in the outcome.",
"This was the push that brought the break.",
"I sat down to rest myself, and began to look around.",
"They asked help to seek him, so we turned back.",
"It is one of the principal sources for the political and social history of the time.",
"Here is a population in which there is a large division of labor.",
"In order that this procedure of his might not appear to be characterized by violence but by justice, he proposed a law about their trial and tried the cases in their absence.",
"He made very little of it, but it meant a lot to us, and to him, too, poor fellow.",
"Banks asked.",
"Banks for the word.",
"My own thought of the moment was not her guide.",
"Beyond them surely was the answer, and perhaps peace.",
"Come on now, boss.",
"It was sweet to feel.",
"The night was dark, cool, and quiet.",
"The air was dry.",
"My father believes it.",
"It left her weak.",
"He sat down.",
"The fellow in the bed next to me is out of his head.",
"To seek a level!",
"To quiet down to peace!",
"The wind came from that side.",
"All became quiet.",
"That knowledge which is popular is not scientific.",
"Then, of course, I had to make them quiet again.",
"He has a bad cut, and is very weak from loss of blood.",
"Beyond doubt the girl was within and alone, and I must trust her quick intelligence to respond to my written message.",
"But what is to be the ending?",
"Now we must be content to seek release through our own efforts.",
"Surely that can be done.",
"My secret hope could not be revealed to this fellow.",
"What had become of the fellow?",
"I am not going to repeat this.",
"So he sat down and made himself at home.",
"And caught in the act, as he had been, it was to be expected that the fellow would have some kind of reasonable story to spin, in order to explain his presence there.",
"Everybody watched to see what the outcome might turn out to be.",
"A few seconds passed.",
"Besides, he would be well paid for all his trouble, and his family might even come over to visit him occasionally.",
"She sat up and watched him.",
"Well, he did not blame her for that.",
"She had meant from the first to take the upper hand.",
"She tried to draw back, to run.",
"How can I be to blame?",
"Fair scenes!",
"As quiet all within me.",
"And, surely enough he did.",
"She did not see that we were depending on her.",
"Life was too sweet.",
"The doctor sat down to read his mail.",
"He told me the father was the only parent the child had in the eyes of the law, and I had no claim on my boy.",
"Surely not.",
"And after a time the wind carried them to a beach where all was summer.",
"In a week, thanks to good nursing, good food, and kind words, I was almost well.",
"But I must return to the conversation I referred to.",
"She did not notice him, for he always walked behind her.",
"How cross she was!",
"I sat down and looked about.",
"Then they came in and sat down.",
"They like quiet, too.",
"I sat and looked at him.",
"The first fine day he was off, and during the rest of the spring and summer we occasionally met him running about the town with a set of fast dogs.",
"He walked much alone after dark.",
"They sat a very long time talking over little family matters.",
"He must teach it himself, by patient observation, by patient common sense.",
"Always try to explain the unknown by the known.",
"But still, some should surely be found here and there.",
"I only mention it to show them what serious questions the scientific man has to face, and to answer, if he can.",
"The relations of some of them to one another or to the whole design are not at all clear.",
"A certain minimum amount of each must be present if life is to continue along the normal lines.",
"And we may explain a number of mental types upon that basis.",
"A relative control of its properties is already in view.",
"Why, I ought to know that fellow.",
"Some are forced to fight by that very division.",
"If they have not, it is conflict.",
"Surely the moral is obvious.",
"Here is a guide with his party.",
"As quiet as a mouse.",
"As weak as water.",
"A hard beginning makes a good ending.",
"Those who play with edge tools must expect to be cut.",
"Where I have thought it absolutely necessary, I have referred to such points in my notes.",
"I ask only for peace and retirement.",
"Pretty soon it was too dark to write and so I just sat there thinking.",
"Then he walked away.",
"For a couple of seconds nobody said anything.",
"Anyway, maybe the wind made it sound that way to him.",
"Then neither of us said anything for a few seconds.",
"But this beautiful cross which will soon be his will bring him closer to us all, I am sure.",
"When it got near enough, we could see that another fellow was in it.",
"I guess that made it kind of easy for the fellow, for he started right in, though I could see it was hard for him to say it.",
"I just had to tell that fellow.",
"I sat on the edge waiting.",
"For a couple of minutes I sat on the edge thinking and I could hear him down there.",
"And we were going to see he got the cross.",
"Surely something was wrong with the girl!",
"But as soon as he was gone, she began with her usual observations.",
"Every thing was quiet.",
"After nearly a minute he came up again, but only to take an observation.",
"And then he was cross.",
"But she did not speak, if possible she became more quiet.",
"And he did not once think that she was a quiet little mouse.",
"How quiet her voice was!",
"He often sat for hours and hours looking out upon the sea.",
"I think the wind must make them.",
"She was ready for sea, but the wind was ahead.",
"What a fine fellow he is.",
"How could a fellow hope to play and win with his girl cutting him like that?",
"Does it teach us that his name is love?",
"The laws of weather, by which the rain comes up off the sea, were unknown to him.",
"They are all but unknown to us now.",
"Indeed the cold and the snow were nothing compared with the wind.",
"Never had there been such wind, he thought.",
"They could not understand, for instance, why he sat so far forward.",
"It will surely do us good.",
"He went to the well to draw water.",
"They walked up and down in front of the house.",
"I loved her too much, and I was weak.",
"Dear little fellow!",
"What would become of that poor little fellow?",
"Still he could not make up his mind to leave his flat, though it was now too large for him, besides being too expensive.",
"Then they walked on again.",
"Yes, it was surely that.",
"International relations, it is agreed, can only turn upon force.",
"This would be no more true of a mental than of a physical diet.",
"It should teach respect for law, and for the rights of others.",
"Go draw me hence!",
"What do I seek?",
"First teach me how to hold it in my hand.",
"Peace, wife, be quiet.",
"Not so, sweet husband.",
"Sweet child.",
"I am so, fellow.",
"What means the fellow?",
"Nor did he ever repeat the experiment of reading to her.",
"The wind was not nearly so high as it had been, and the sea had for some time been going down.",
"And that is where we got the idea about not allowing folks to vote who could not fight.",
"All the laws are made by men, and for the most part the rights only of male citizens are considered.",
"There is something very new and very big and very complex about these new relations of capital and labor.",
"It was a most dramatic fight.",
"He sat looking across the river with quiet eyes.",
"It was nearly dark, a warm evening of late spring, and there was no wind.",
"Then she sat down again.",
"He sat down without speaking.",
"It is good to love the unknown.",
"The business of their dramatic characters will not stand the moral test.",
"What treat can we have now?",
"The effect was, as if a murder had been committed in cold blood.",
"I give it in my large edition.",
"Surely this country may be said to spread rather than to rise.",
"We took the measurements and bought new glass from the glass shop.",
"After lunch, I wrote down the observations that I had made.",
"So I sat and looked at a couple of books in his office.",
"I showed him my reference letter and in a little while he sat to talk with me.",
"But quiet and security are now at an end.",
"The next question that occurs, is, in what degree we ought to do it, and whether we should do it with our whole force?",
"It is not a part of my plan to give any particular description of them.",
"We had now much wind, but no rain.",
"I hope for some help from warm weather, which will surely come in time.",
"He that writes thus, surely writes for show.",
"This note was added to the second edition.",
"I of the second edition.",
"I felt unable to share his confidence.",
"He walked out.",
"We walked!",
"Weak as he was, he tried to turn on his side to search for it.",
"We sat down, for there seemed much to say.",
"They were always sweet and kind to her and she loved to talk about them.",
"After which there was deep quiet.",
"But where is my description of the weather all this time?",
"Blame him not.",
"Who can blame her, poor girl?",
"That surely should teach him something.",
"The weak under it go to the wall.",
"We shall sometimes have our heads broken.",
"But they are the weak party.",
"It is too early to say how many will respond.",
"It is likely to bring a sensitive class in conflict with the police.",
"To those who are unable to make up their mind I say by all means wait.",
"The other half is too weak to offer it.",
"I could understand the state of his mind, no matter how those mental conditions had been brought about.",
"I was waiting to meet some one with whom I had business, and while I sat there an old woman stopped in front of me.",
"Everybody was quiet, for it was not known what was to happen next.",
"After dinner we walked through the village up to the rock.",
"By degrees, the whole thing came back to him.",
"The conflict was terrible.",
"For a moment he sat and thought.",
"If there were any hell, surely he had lived in it!",
"She sat quite still for a moment.",
"He turned and walked by her side.",
"He watched her cross the road.",
"I was weak to think of it.",
"I can only repeat what I have said.",
"We walked on down the street.",
"So I walked up to the hotel feeling easier in my mind.",
"The poor fellow left us next day, and we never saw him again.",
"The light was so bad that I was unable to see more than this.",
"What followed took place within a few seconds.",
"A few more seconds passed.",
"He mentioned that he had had a son who was dead, and was now without relations.",
"Then he suddenly walked to the door.",
"She knew his age was somewhere near her own, perhaps he was a year, surely no more than that, older than herself.",
"At the weak spot the strain was too great.",
"But go on into the house and get some dry clothes on.",
"He remained quiet.",
"She did not draw away.",
"At length he was forced to seek safety at home.",
"Weak, weak, for ever weak!",
"Boys and women weak!",
"I sat down between my father and mother as I used to do, but I did not feel at home.",
"A great quiet filled the air.",
"I looked it out on the map.",
"Inside the room an old man sat at a table.",
"The strength of her love made her weak as water where that love was concerned.",
"There is no one more beautiful, no one more sweet.",
"That is as much to say as father of the citizens.",
"They sat at the end of the great green table.",
"In the notes of this book will be found this document complete.",
"They walked about arm in arm.",
"They walked quickly, so as to warm themselves.",
"We walked, as in the morning, in little separate groups.",
"They are neither citizens nor men.",
"She was carrying a child.",
"He had walked straight before him.",
"To kill each other, citizens!",
"The conflict began.",
"As for myself I am not a bad fellow.",
"He walked in.",
"This old phrase assumed a new sense.",
"No human system of mental training could ever do it.",
"Great quiet should be observed.",
"But it is time that I should now wind up the case before us.",
"All the town was quiet.",
"He may be called weak, but he was not.",
"He sat by the window.",
"She was weak, and he offered to carry her in his strong arms.",
"He was unable to hold them together.",
"It is indeed strange to find such lines as those in the work of an unknown author.",
"The more to blame.",
"Speak on, fellow.",
"Cannot much blame him.",
"By the terms of its nature it can respond to us only as we recognize it.",
"Personally, he was content with all the world, though his wife was somewhat less so.",
"Meanwhile his home relations had somewhat changed.",
"He looked at a map.",
"Maybe she had walked along to the next block.",
"She is as sweet, it seems to me, as any woman can be who has come into this world.",
"The pair had been having a good time all by themselves on the day referred to.",
"Their individual heads were worth something.",
"The fight now began, and, I must repeat, I never saw anything like it.",
"The situation was dramatic.",
"I leave my description, for I can do no more justice to it.",
"Probably he was scientific.",
"The jury for a long time were unable to agree.",
"It was a kind of medical jury which sat upon me.",
"One occurs to my mind, with which I will close this chapter.",
"There was nothing in the savings bank, and much was needed there.",
"First of all, we must follow these measurements.",
"Surely the man who does these things will be happy.",
"No conflict, no character.",
"They seek an education to fit them for work, and they do their work well because it is a part of their education.",
"So much had happened since morning that he could recall it all only in a series of long mental pictures.",
"Good old fellow.",
"He sat down on its front steps to think.",
"He led the way down a quiet street.",
"It is just possible that this fellow has something to tell me which I ought to hear.",
"Not so much to me, personally, as to our people.",
"He loved to have mother see him winning.",
"The children were so sweet and serious over their play!",
"We have no place to teach them in, except our church.",
"The following is the article referred to.",
"If he was to be paid for carrying them away, that was gain enough.",
"When committed to the prison, I was by no means well.",
"He went down the steps and walked on and away as a matter of course, but once more stopped.",
"And what had he done, what crime committed?",
"It seemed to come, small and quiet, from so far off.",
"Surely he was watched.",
"When a really important case occurs, it interests me.",
"They got up and walked out.",
"Surely not!",
"Guide absolutely necessary.",
"Guide necessary.",
"They sure enough do mix it whenever they get together.",
"He always did when he was working out a mental problem.",
"Yet even now she could not blame herself for what she had done.",
"Nor did he blame her.",
"They walked down the road side by side, neither of them speaking.",
"During the night the wind died down.",
"An express could not have carried her fast enough.",
"East, west, or north, they would have to find the fellow and bring him back.",
"Such nursing as was possible he gave.",
"Go through, old fellow.",
"Also what document it was.",
"He gave mine no pressure, but he let me draw him into the house.",
"Then I walked back into the room again.",
"I knew where to go to find the house, and I knew that the murder had been committed in a back room on the top floor.",
"I had to get the document.",
"Sweet little thing, too.",
"But it looks safe enough to cross.",
"He may follow out the relations of each in turn, but he cannot follow them out together.",
"The degrees are many.",
"Yet this error is frequently committed.",
"They will blame me.",
"He was very cross.",
"But, fear of the unknown?",
"They hurt him or kill him, surely for ends of their own.",
"But nothing has run in at the upper end.",
"As far as I know he has never written on any scientific subject.",
"That is mental education.",
"Over our heads, remember.",
"I do not blame him, but he seems to me to be beginning at the middle, rather than at the beginning.",
"He was not sure what he meant, but the good fellow felt some violence done somewhere or other.",
"He had walked home with her.",
"She took her old place, assumed her old offices.",
"Heads turned to look at her.",
"He who does not believe these things, whenever he goes there will know that I have said nothing but what is true.",
"Boss, however, got out of it by saying that he was not at home when the trouble occurred.",
"After giving me a number of names he would make me repeat them.",
"Then she replaced the book, put out the light and went to sleep very easily.",
"At last she went to an upper window and looked out.",
"It was almost as quiet as the country there.",
"Surely, that could not be required of him.",
"Such a sweet couple, too!",
"Sometimes, when we are talking together, some subject comes up on which I do not care to express my opinion.",
"Now a quiet moment came.",
"Come and seek us.",
"The wind may change.",
"I only teach here.",
"Cross my heart!",
"It may not be quite dry.",
"As a scientific fact, it cannot.",
"All we need now is a little rest and quiet.",
"Heat is hard on folks with weak heads.",
"Did I seem cross?",
"It is a moment of severe quiet.",
"When I took it in my hands it all came out to me, sweet and strong.",
"But love does not blame love.",
"Fine little fellow.",
"Surely he must see that he was the one to blame, not she.",
"It was the face, almost, of a man of middle age, a firm, quiet face with cold eyes.",
"He knows that he went for a walk, early, and that he walked all day.",
"Never had he seen her eyes so sweet, so dark.",
"She did not taste the sweet, but it was there.",
"All was quiet now.",
"I want to be quiet, to rest, to think.",
"The air was sweet.",
"Twice he walked home with her.",
"All those great properties could be bought at one time or another for a song.",
"What a sweet room?",
"The others sat like images.",
"Then he sat down.",
"They sat some time over and after their dinner, as if they were waiting for something or somebody.",
"Quiet, now, quiet.",
"The more I studied the document, the less I liked it.",
"I cannot, unless there personally, control this.",
"There was no break in physical evolution when mental processes began, nor will there be in the evolution of knowledge as long as they continue to exist.",
"In the morning, however, the wind had gone down, and we made an early start.",
"When once sick, they appear to have no physical or mental resistance.",
"Sometimes they become so weak from this disease that they lie down and die.",
"In places such as this the animals are very difficult to detect.",
"How much further west they may be found I have been unable to determine.",
"He put his hands out to push it back from him.",
"And where could he have walked from?",
"And the time would be so short now that she thought surely she could wait.",
"Receiving no answer he looked around.",
"Here he sat down again.",
"He had often to stop and rest, he felt so very weak.",
"He sat down for a few minutes to rest, and then started on his return.",
"He sat down to rest and to consider the question.",
"He thought that some sweet voice was telling him what to do.",
"But he was weak enough still.",
"They therefore extended the search mainly in that direction.",
"There he sat down to rest.",
"Retirement from the world.",
"The advantage of being on good terms with relations.",
"We went and sat a while in the library.",
"We walked to it.",
"We met them as we walked up.",
"The rest of us walked.",
"I should be glad to see the fellow.",
"I cannot express how happy I was on finding myself again at home.",
"The offices are below.",
"The latter part of this note is not in the first edition.",
"This note is not in the first edition.",
"Books are almost unknown in this house.",
"But surely that is very natural.",
"He would not express any thanks.",
"Its use is unknown.",
"In certain cases, however, it is referred even beyond this.",
"The cutting up of an animal in order to learn its structure.",
"But he must teach himself to forget them.",
"Soon he will seek to return.",
"But no, I shall surely not accept.",
"Description of it.",
"Puts it to flight.",
"I repeat, that it cannot come to any thing.",
"If women have such things in their heads, why should not I in my heart?",
"Sweet music does it make them.",
"He was ahead of her to the door, and thought he would surely win.",
"Mother will surely come now.",
"Look at them now, with their heads together!",
"Now I must try and get dry.",
"But I did want to get this one on which I had the option.",
"Surely, surely it must be so!",
"An old fellow and a market man!",
"Then seek some other course, make here no stay.",
"Can I lead them that cannot guide myself?",
"I began to live, then, and found life very sweet.",
"He had no mental fear.",
"But this art cannot be given, it must be purchased.",
"And he was fairly quick on the draw as well.",
"He immediately fell flat on the floor.",
"In the draw he opened the package.",
"Small blame to her if her eyes were closed.",
"She closed her eyes, and he began to walk about carrying her.",
"Surely there must be a village down there.",
"The flat seemed to be more quiet even than usual.",
"The principal will go out suddenly early some morning.",
"For a long time past I have provided against just such an outcome as this.",
"Why, we have just got our second wind!",
"Poor old fellow!",
"But we can hardly judge until we have seen the actual document.",
"He would probably have referred me to the police, and then what could I have done?",
"He could not have already committed the murder.",
"No man can teach others who cannot teach his own family.",
"Having reached the certain, he would apply it to all the relations of life, and to all kinds of knowledge.",
"Scientific knowledge, truly speaking, there was none.",
"After this there would surely, we thought, be something like the church we were seeking.",
"Clean as well as dry.",
"Diversity of opinion.",
"It should be clean, as well as dry.",
"On this point, there is a great diversity of opinion.",
"There is indeed a great diversity in the quality even of this single article.",
"There is another error committed in carrying children in the arms.",
"I doubt whether the effect here referred to, is ever the result of such a cause.",
"Thus it occasionally is, in the case before us.",
"A description of their method of writing is more difficult.",
"Surely this was his native village, which he had left but the day before.",
"Very quiet.",
"But surely they were very quiet!",
"I was, therefore, unable to help him in any way.",
"He left the great offices of state, however, in the hands of the rich, giving the people a share in those which were not so important.",
"What schools did they teach or even visit?",
"There I had a call for making water, and sat me down to perform it.",
"I some how or other reached the dry land.",
"I am a happy fellow this day!",
"There was not the least need to repeat it in writing.",
"Whenever he is at home, I shall be at my post of observation.",
"Whenever he goes out, I shall be after him.",
"Before I could pull them back, they both sat down again.",
"She sat thinking.",
"I have had questions of a similar character asked me before, occasionally.",
"Every phrase was charged with his own feeling.",
"So it was that he was prepared to take his place as scientific leader of the next great effort.",
"And as I now looked upon the old structure, the early scenes seemed to return.",
"All classes fell under the good influence, and both students and citizens shared in the result.",
"Occasionally a man is a year in finding his place.",
"She sat by her window and went over and over again the question, what should she do.",
"Sweet little sister!",
"He knew that he could cross.",
"He was soon ready, and walked out of the front door between the man who had called for him and another.",
"We walked to the fair.",
"Surely it was right to help her to a husband.",
"How sweet her company would be if she would see him!",
"All had been very quiet about the house.",
"She sat much in her own room.",
"Protection to the weak was the first thought of the strong man.",
"She tried to recall every phrase and put a sense to it.",
"He made the sign of the cross.",
"She said she felt that she knew us both so well that it would be a treat to her.",
"Let them be referred to.",
"Sometimes again, a cross which we should have said was much too wide will have an excellent effect.",
"Surely there are some things which, like politics, are too serious to be taken quite seriously.",
"In the upper part of the town there is a large school or college.",
"How quiet and full of rest does everything appear to be.",
"The phrase occurs in several old songs.",

"His friend was there, and again he sat down next to her.",
"When they went out it was dark, and he walked by her side.",
"It met with her entire approval.",
"There was no conflict in her.",
"A few additional degrees either way, and the life and the light in me go out.",
"I looked it up on the star map.",
"What was wrong was the observations we had taken.",
"At any rate, he took a series of observations of the sun from various parts of the island.",
"But this time it was little rain and all wind.",
"It was a black night, and we were running before the wind.",
"Wind broke off.",
"Do not seek to be free.",
"Do not seek marriage.",
"And when he arrived, they took him to the upper room.",
"But they kept quiet, and told no one in those days any of the things they had seen.",
"So he began to teach them many things.",
"Sweet, sweet!",
"I was coming to draw to him, to like him, almost, might I say, to love him.",

"Surely this is the other world.",
"A thing unknown in this age.",
"Sweet spot, sweet spot.",
"I only wish it were a few years from now, when I hope to have something more substantial to show for myself.",
"Sweet thought.",

"It is a sweet thought.",
"I do not know how to express how much I think of them.",

"All was perfectly dark, and not a sound came to me.",
"How tired I felt.",
"The door, leading into the garden, was half open.",
"Yet, nothing has occurred, and I am too tired to watch longer.",
"I learned a great deal from merely listening while the men talked at dinner.",
"It was perfectly impossible for me to answer them.",
"He was a very old man, and played rarely in those days, but one would have liked to hear him.",
"He talked politics, and a good deal about pictures with some artists who were present.",
"Greater care must be taken of the rural church.",
"A university also holds rule over truth.",
"From that hour he has vision and power.",
"I could not bear next day to be alone for a moment.",
"Give us the facts.",
"No rats, no mice.",
"I joined him.",
"These men had no perspective by which to judge such things.",
"The men never allowed me even the chance of private communication while he was with us.",
"But we understood each other.",
"The others understood.",
"It would only have worried him.",
"There was excuse for the doctor.",
"At all events it is so with me, and from my observation of men, I am strong in the faith that it is so with every one who is neither more nor less than human.",
"We wanted that bear.",
"All over the world, change, improvement, progress are the words.",
"The boat was almost full now.",
"No boat!",
"Is it equally so to set a flat to catch one?",
"He loved his work and never tired of it.",
"I admit it.",
"I know such a lot of artists.",
"They hardly ever had any entertainment without her.",
"And yet the fact remained that they did not nearly fill her life.",
"At last, she could bear the flat no longer.",
"But she pulled herself together.",
"A perfectly safe thing.",
"She enjoyed teaching the girls very much.",
"Sometimes she was so sick, she did not know what was happening.",
"She was very tired.",
"They are tired.",
"The next day they would be too tired and sick to do anything.",
"They stayed several days.",
"She was going where men were drinking and making themselves wild.",
"She was tired from the hard trip to their village.",
"This was something like a governor and judge.",
"Once more the government sent its boat to take her back to her mission station.",
"Her friends were very much worried about her health.",
"Grown familiar, I pulled it to the window.",
"Perhaps I have quoted enough.",
"We were then told to get necessary things ordered, and so we did.",
"There were opportunities for other beautiful long hits which were not made.",
"I cannot bear it.",
"When I came to the end I let go of one side and pulled the other with me as I dropped.",
"They formed a complete line in front of us.",
"We were walking in the garden.",
"Forms affected my vision no longer.",
"When are soldiers like writers for the press?",
"Also a man may be great and be perfectly aware of it.",
"But we rarely heard from them.",
"I do get so tired of these old streets.",
"She pulled him down.",
"Yes, he would go so far as to admit that he did.",
"Only stayed a month.",
"He knew perfectly well how to get out of this damn hole.",
"Admit him.",
"She is perfectly dear about it.",
"Then he went back into the garden.",
"It had been very hard to bear.",
"She never understood quite how I loved her.",
"It would have been perfectly simple.",
"Yes, they all grow tired after a while.",
"And thus the situation stayed.",
"The artists have enjoyed the stories and children equally enjoy the pictures.",
"He could also begin to estimate the produce of the school garden.",
"But the real child only lies in wait to make opportunities out of school.",
"One of the teachers had, however, a vision which became a reality.",
"The teacher has the making of opportunities largely in her own hands.",
"We were out yesterday morning cutting down trees to build a boat.",
"But they formed the one party that really knew its own mind.",
"There was also a corresponding improvement in civil life.",
"Sometimes he was her dinner partner.",
"Late in the afternoon, just before the dark fell, I walked out to drink my fill of the place.",
"He does not think of payment, for the finding is payment enough.",
"But this time I understood it.",
"I had passed too far beyond the limits of my strength.",
"What is the use of getting my hopes all raised?",
"But the vision had come when she could not see it, and now returned no more.",
"I came in my sleep, and understood nothing.",
"And the time seems not long for the love I bear him.",
"I could not bear it.",
"I was never tired of it.",
"He was quiet directly, like a man, as if he quite understood.",
"Why this should have been I cannot tell, but I had a feeling that if there was an answer it would be more than I could bear.",
"That is the partner of my life.",
"He had not understood, though I think he heard what I said.",
"Quickly his mind formed another plan.",
"Equally, of course, he would look for him.",
"Let us bring them all before us in vision.",
"This is, however, very rarely the case.",
"Regard the matter as we will, however, the facts remain.",
"However, I am not aware that such facts exist.",
"Indeed, though that was not the origin of the order, that was the use made of it.",
"But the day passed, and there was no advance.",
"The solid line must do the work at hand.",
"There, lie perfectly still.",
"Union men have no friends here.",
"My mother is perfectly right.",
"But when it came to the reality she could not bear the consequences.",
"But it can be controlled.",
"As for me, I stayed here to watch.",
"People who came stayed there, it seemed.",
"After all, there was some excuse.",
"I admit my error.",
"The big man pulled his gun first on me.",
"Damn her!",
"Then I understood.",
"I could not bear that!",
"But on the boat I saw him, and then I knew.",
"Perhaps the idea that she needed excuse did not occur to her.",
"Had I any excuse for being present?",
"It makes me a little tired, sometimes.",
"It was more than she could bear.",
"But it took many years for the country to fill with people.",
"He came to his own hole at last, no doubt.",
"Some men are great soldiers.",
"He thought that he could do more good in teaching than in any other way.",
"Many families were divided.",
"They sent their soldiers to stay in the houses of the people.",
"The people had to take care of the soldiers.",
"The general sent word that the soldiers must not stay any longer in her house.",
"The men pulled as fast as they could.",
"His friends pulled him out.",
"They sent him more soldiers.",
"Once a mother bear tried to kill him.",
"The bear ran at him.",
"The bear ran against it and was killed.",
"But when he was tired of play, he took up a book.",
"This they set up in the fishing boat.",
"They said that such a boat would never go.",
"People had never seen any such boat as this.",
"Then the boat began to move.",
"But still the boat kept moving.",
"They could not see what made the boat go.",
"His wife went to teaching to help make a living.",
"There was a bear in the tree.",
"He could not bear to see one person do any wrong to another.",
"First one bear tried to get him, and then the other.",
"After a while she left off teaching.",
"Which expression of the thought would be the more easily understood by the average person?",
"These purposes and methods are general.",
"The former is a return in words to a question, a communication, or an argument.",
"These facts and ideas are supposed to be matters of common knowledge.",
"There is also an extensive light of information in them.",
"A further improvement may here be suggested.",
"He agreed to this on condition that I would give him one quarter of my earnings.",
"The boat that ought to have met them had not arrived.",
"He was tired.",
"The boat listed away from the wall.",
"He could trust the man he left, and wanted to see what was happening.",
"Then one afternoon he knew he could not go down again, and he stayed under water long.",
"At length he pulled out his watch.",
"He looked very tired and she did not want to talk.",
"We must respect the facts.",
"The only advantage is the facility for receiving company.",
"The soldiers are picked men.",
"In all this management of the human body, we are sure to get what we pay for, and we are equally sure not to get what we do not pay for.",
"What sources of information have been open to us, what means of getting at the facts?",
"The phrase organized the party.",
"To the facts, then.",
"It was the vision of a moment.",
"I must be equally fair with old people now.",
"But those women had vision.",
"They had faith in their ability to serve.",
"A word more about her business, for she is playing an economic part that brings us up at attention.",
"We may know that something important is happening when even the government takes note.",
"She is welcome everywhere.",
"Is her vision good in each eye?",
"Behind, the house was perfectly dark.",
"The others did as ordered.",
"He pulled open the window, and walked into the room.",
"Had they but stayed there!",
"She was always perfectly open, both in manner and speech.",
"Then, if he chose to draw back, well and good.",
"Facts are facts, and we cannot go against them.",
"I understood him, and he thought he understood me.",
"But I soon found that I must do without light if I stayed there.",
"Calling her name, I said that I was tired and would be glad to say good night.",
"The jury ought to know these facts.",
"I had pulled the window open before I turned my head.",
"She understood, and had faith in him.",
"Both had holds.",
"He, too, was listening.",
"He loved them, and understood them.",
"The city people could not bear to hear them nor to read them.",
"He often brings me food.",
"I die for lack of strength to bear my trials.",
"As these things were going on, the owner of the garden arrived.",
"He had a garden near his house.",
"The man stayed there all that day until night.",
"While the people were drinking they heard something moving at the bottom of the well.",
"He stayed there a month and became white as snow.",
"The woman stayed in the country.",
"The little boy stayed at school until evening.",
"Further, there was the damage to assess.",
"The payments will be made in money and in kind.",
"He was up earlier than usual the next morning, and out in the garden.",
"Well, if that was all, I could bear it, certainly.",
"But I was not listening.",
"It was some minutes before I understood the full effect which such an order would have.",
"But much pressure was brought to bear upon him to get him back into the service.",
"We took our places and the advance began again.",
"I could not but admit the truth of this, and said as much.",
"It was as well, perhaps, that I did not know this then, for I might not have thought my own portion of the problem so easy of solution.",
"Look facts in the face!",
"I must bear it as I may.",
"In a sense that is a perfectly natural thing.",
"If the nation wants soldiers it must pay for them.",
"He could not possibly give all the real facts, and so he uses a phrase.",
"They did not know the facts.",
"The advance started from the left of the line.",
"It is well to go back to these facts.",
"We shall come across them everywhere along the front.",
"As to the arms and equipment, look back at these facts.",
"I understood.",
"It is everywhere.",
"What was happening?",
"The soldiers started.",
"His reading did not seem to me to have been very extensive.",
"He could run well for a small boy, but he got tired at last and sat down to rest.",
"At length he began to feel so hot and tired that he could only walk.",
"It was too late in the day, and he was too tired to walk further.",
"But the real facts he had never revealed to me.",
"But she controlled herself perfectly.",
"See, here is the boat.",
"Yet if the boat was not in waiting below that closed door?",
"But the facts are quite otherwise.",
"No man stayed at home.",
"How many classes of politicians are there?",
"Because the leading artists there are of an off color.",
"In advance.",
"Almost everywhere they held high ground.",
"We formed up and started with the rest.",
"To make only a small advance would leave us worse off than now.",
"And this was good enough for most purposes.",
"So I ordered every one to take cover.",
"But he finally pulled through.",
"But that night, and the next day and the next, we began to get through information of what had been happening all along the line.",
"I am listening.",
"All around us, every day, these things are happening.",
"Hell to pay everywhere.",
"It will be understood.",
"Surely he understood.",
"I had to decide pretty quickly whether or not I would admit any previous knowledge of her.",
"Work or reading was equally out of the question that day.",
"Winter pulled out a watch.",
"I went to the back door, and, finding it closed, looked into the garden.",
"She took him into the garden.",
"The child could talk to him in his own language perfectly well.",
"Meanwhile another actor appeared upon the scene.",
"I say, very little improvement.",
"He will make them trust him and love him, all the more because he knows that through false teaching they do not trust and love him as they used to do.",
"The glass everywhere is unfortunately modern.",
"But who are those that now begin to fill their places?",
"I admit.",
"It is perfectly a test.",
"This has been for many weeks my lot and my excuse.",
"I cannot bear to pay for articles I used to get for nothing.",
"I am sometimes chemical myself.",
"This was a great facility to me.",
"Not only that, but the channels kept changing.",
"There was no glass, so he pulled himself through.",
"Not only that, but they would be worried sick.",
"Our chief hopes for food were in our guns.",
"Let me now review the series of general crimes.",
"There was some excuse for them.",
"She was ordered rest and felt she needed it.",
"With regard to her books, she believed they would be little read after her death.",
"This girl of many hopes had no regular education.",
"She had to bear her part in general society.",
"He ordered her to go home to his mother.",
"What death to his hopes!",
"I went all about the house and garden to look for him.",
"She used to excuse herself, and say, that reading hurt her eyes.",
"But there are a few minor points too.",
"We are all so in a minor degree.",
"The thing was organized.",
"She only knew that this man seemed to understand her as no one had ever understood her.",
"What had they understood?",
"While they were standing there the other man who had been following joined them.",
"She was tired.",
"I admit that.",
"Looking back was not included in his method of life, which was rather characterized by a large faith and a forward pressure.",
"I live at peace with all men and pay my bills every week.",
"Sure, he brings news.",
"And things are happening.",
"They will walk further, eat less, work harder, and stay longer to get an education than for anything else in the world.",
"And what shall I say about the wedding?",
"The wedding was near at hand, and everybody but himself had been getting ready this long time.",
"Inside they should be kept perfectly clean, and where an open fire is used, the outside as clean as possible.",
"The others are used for medical purposes.",
"The broken part should be kept perfectly quiet.",
"It will then fill up from the bottom.",
"They then left the garden.",
"Indeed, as we shall see, she has done a good deal more to determine this, in regard to the various parts of her record, than most have done, and it is for that reason that we have taken the opportunity to open up the general question.",
"The boy, of course, had to choose between these different sides, and he chose the side of his country and of the people.",
"Such a garden will never be seen again.",
"I had to admit it myself, however.",
"I cannot bear this!",
"It is not very specific, I admit.",
"It had all been planned in advance, and the plan was carried out exactly as made.",
"They seemed to have no guns, but the number of our soldiers in that field was not very large.",
"A charge at double quick was ordered, and we carried the first line of works.",
"The dead were everywhere.",
"War brings new conditions.",
"Then I pulled myself together and ran at full speed until I came to a street which I recognized.",
"Bear back!",
"This is no fit wedding.",
"Party will bear with party, but party will not bear with truth.",
"Faith, he was pretty right!",
"Before the week was over she began to make her wedding dress.",
"Just right for her and her purposes!",
"The man fell forward, almost out of the boat.",
"Elections must be free.",
"The world might perhaps be well ordered, but there would be no freedom, and no fun.",
"How then can it be maintained that war is not good business?",
"But a good many of such cases are known to soldiers, and I have seen none of them in the press.",
"He cannot bear to think that he lives in a town.",
"They made us many soldiers.",
"And, in brief, they ordered everything else just as seemed good to them.",
"They thought they knew the cause, and told each other so when he was not listening.",
"Not that anybody was listening, either!",
"He often went away and stayed for weeks, and her not knowing where he was or how he would come home.",
"He worried her always.",
"The principal cause of their surprise was that she seemed perfectly happy.",
"How much she understood I could not judge.",
"Nor even now do I understand how a society formed of such members can be held together.",
"I saw, though at the moment I hardly understood, how she had reached this point.",
"The scene that followed I cannot bear to recall.",
"We were so many and so divided, and each wanted only to be himself.",
"We only saw the consequences.",
"Her father did not look as if anything worried him.",
"She was perfectly quiet.",
"If they tired he never knew it.",
"He could see light through more than one little hole.",
"A house divided against itself is what he called his home.",
"I bear his name.",
"That was his partner.",
"The soldiers went wild.",
"Soldiers were bringing food and drink to them.",
"In regard to this war I can only feel.",
"These are cold facts.",
"With regard to their reading, the mother examined every book that came into the house.",
"People have to learn sometimes not only how much the heart, but how much the head, can bear.",
"I was very tired, but we continued to stand.",
"More than that, I have lost faith in him.",
"Damn me, I believe he is.",
"I alone knew what that boat was bringing.",
"Only what I saw in the return of the boat tells me what followed.",
"This was a new view of the situation, a new vision.",
"Could there be more than one boat, and if not what force of men might such a boat contain?",
"In fact all of the boys were really tired out.",
"At length we pulled away.",
"That is to say, that portion of the message which she considered important.",
"At least she understood and she would like to be like them.",
"He understood.",
"Again she understood.",
"The mother bear, he discovered the following morning.",
"She understood but gave no sign of understanding.",
"With nothing in particular to be said, virtually nothing was said.",
"Her wedding!",
"Their wedding gift!",
"She was tired and, what was more, she had every right and reason to be tired.",
"But she was not listening.",
"And, if this be the case, what will that be which leads them to union with each other?",
"But no water showed in the bottom of this hole in the ice.",
"I will see if I can break the ice around the hole.",
"There are certain facts that must be told.",
"She suddenly understood.",
"I have seen women do far harder work than this.",
"She knew they were all listening, but she did not care.",
"Let the child keep her faith!",
"Sometimes he went in for his mail, and stayed perhaps half an hour.",
"It would be several days before communication could be established.",
"They came in, stayed a few days and passed out again.",
"He looked harder at her.",
"It had carried elections.",
"Their only interest in me was that I could carry elections.",
"Nor have I been quite alone in my faith.",
"Strong that it was perfectly safe for the boys to go about together.",
"Where have we discovered our facts?",
"I could not bear to look at him.",
"At last I could bear the pain no longer, I sat up in my box and looked about me.",
"Rats, rats!",
"For a long time she stayed there, and never once tried to catch them.",
"She will be very tired.",
"We had a long, cold spring, and not being used to the heat, it seemed very hard to bear.",
"The coach went away up into the country one day, and came back the next.",
"It was a great event in our neighborhood when a bear was caught.",
"They understood quite well that I would not hurt them, and passed by me.",
"I stayed there for a long time.",
"Faith and works.",
"My faith!",
"But they will be able to rule, they will be able to act, because they have taken the trouble to learn the facts and the laws of nature.",
"Now a few words on its chemical action.",
"That is the sort of audience which we want, if we are teaching natural science.",
"But of the facts there can be no doubt.",
"That provided an image of something material happening as an explanation.",
"For the great majority there was no faith to take its place.",
"These children are always on the go, never get tired, require little sleep.",
"A direct exchange of the male and female roles can thus be achieved.",
"Will has been down in this hole, and so have I before.",
"And there was no lack of social entertainment.",
"I think it would be very nice to have some entertainment or something and make some money for them again.",
"That was the initial idea of the union.",
"We should no longer face a solid people.",
"No other hopes remain.",
"In a couple of seconds everybody in camp was around the boat, waiting to hear what the camp doctor said.",
"I have to admit they had everything fine.",
"The business of every one was now the choice of a partner.",
"I think the past year has been even just a little harder on him than it has on me.",
"One was found to fill the bill.",
"Mother hopes that will never be.",
"She understood but too well what her father and mother meant.",
"It was intended that everything should be as much as possible like the original wedding.",
"It was he that understood.",
"The others joined him.",
"We understood each other.",
"Come to the boat.",
"He understood perfectly.",
"But, as I said, he released me when he chose to do it, and it does not matter.",
"He would think I was making fun of him to give him such an excuse.",
"He was another one to bear it.",
"What excuse could she make to the child?",
"And the pilot, they had such a funny pilot!",
"No one understood and no one helped her.",
"He had understood then, he should understand now.",
"All were worried, and showed it.",
"He did not see that look in her eyes, or he would have understood how much she was hurt.",
"That is a matter of faith.",
"It holds fast by their hand, it will not leave their side.",
"And by his works his faith was made perfect.",
"His faith is only shown by his works.",
"This shall be their portion too surely.",
"But it is far more true to human nature, and to the facts which we see in the world about us, than any story of a good old time would have been.",
"Any one of a number of things might have happened to their father, but they were not worried.",
"Suddenly he came on a break in the solid face of the ice.",
"With that word their hands joined.",
"Now he found that he had hopes.",
"Such terrible crimes are not committed by men in a right state of mind.",
"Equally of course he knew that he ought not to go.",
"I was assigned to watch her then.",
"Something was happening in the house across the way.",
"Did she think he did not suspect her of knowing more about them than she had chosen to admit?",
"He made an early excuse to get away, having something new to think about.",
"I admit it is true.",
"On the other hand, however, should he do anything for the girl, it would become known, and everybody would regard him as responsible.",
"Had a vision come to him also?",
"We shall no doubt be a little late for the wedding.",
"What could be happening?",
"But, above all things, she was to carry it on in such a way that nobody should suspect anything, neither the boy himself nor the folks of the district.",
"Excuse me, but it is a service I shall never forget.",
"Still he had not fully understood.",
"Why was it, too, that she now felt so tired?",
"Still a month went by without anything serious happening.",
"What could be happening then?",
"These views, it is true, are both too simple for the facts.",
"Why, how now, soldiers, is he living yet?",
"A bear?",
"A bear, a bear, a bear!",
"Faith, so can my wife.",
"Well, I can bear enough, but not too much.",
"Yes, I can well direct the coach of love.",
"Yes, faith.",
"Well, I must bear it all.",
"The door of the garden being open he ran straight through it.",
"He ran up to the hole, and put his arm in after her and called to her to come out, but she would not.",
"It was all perfectly simple.",
"I had an excellent opportunity to see what was going on everywhere.",
"It did not matter now what boat I took.",
"He did not miss the next one he pulled up.",
"Had they no pilot on board?",
"They were to ride everywhere.",
"A boat!",
"There are, of course, limits to its power.",
"Between individuals, such action would clearly be considered bad faith.",
"It is ordered.",
"She was listening.",
"He broke off and looked towards the open window, listening.",
"The money was wanted for political purposes.",
"She was tired out.",
"The times cannot bear them.",
"It was the case with a late actor.",
"The things do not fill up that space, which the idea of them seemed to take up in his mind.",
"At what time can the taste be formed?",
"I joined the team as an extra.",
"The answer is equally simple.",
"He examined systems by experiments, and formed experiments into systems.",
"He has not failed in either of his purposes.",
"I cannot but express my hopes that this method will be generally approved.",
"And what consequences have they produced?",
"They told us to go on, and joined us soon after.",
"He brings things from the north, and the south, and from every quarter.",
"Whether I shall continue free, or shall fill again, cannot be told.",
"The early produce of his garden had sold well.",
"It seemed, indeed, that we were never to be done with these consequences.",
"Nor was it easy, to make him speak, but I achieved this at last.",
"A woman face, be it understood, not the face of a woman.",
"Let us start with the facts now known to modern physical science.",
"This is the method of all the advance that has ever been made.",
"This brings us to the essential point of the whole matter.",
"Can one wonder that she was everywhere and anywhere at all homes and in all places?",
"The doctor and his son now joined them.",
"He was in a minority of one against the whole world, on all points, right or wrong.",
"The following are the facts as at present reported.",
"I want ordered progress.",
"But he had faith in the people.",
"But that faith is gone.",
"It is the last article of my faith.",
"Never before had a wife heard such stories from a husband, and there never could have been a woman who would have heard them with such religious faith.",
"He put himself into communication with the officers of the museum, and I left the matter entirely in his hands.",
"I perfectly remember her words.",
"Were this the case there would be no exercise of faith.",
"I think if it was otherwise, it would be more than I could bear.",
"They found the town pretty quiet, though full of soldiers.",
"No one would bear anything of our business.",
"The party in advance took the beach road.",
"I do not need facts, because facts count for little.",
"Very worried.",
"The actor probably understood the whole situation well enough.",
"Then he began to follow us everywhere.",
"He knew that now perfectly well.",
"He was kind, and in his way he understood.",
"She heard perfectly.",
"So I tried to explain the facts.",
"Years passed, bringing with them great changes for me.",
"She opened the door to admit her husband.",
"This was done effectively.",
"So, arm in arm, they passed from the pretty garden of sleep.",
"A couple of men got off the day coach.",
"She tried to be perfectly still.",
"They was just tired and went to bed.",
"I have quoted enough to show that these plays must, in the condition of the people to whom they were presented, have had much to do with their religious education.",
"To listening thought the voice of truth is clear.",
"It was a vision!",
"I have not seen the governor for I forget how many years.",
"Back came the vision of the strange girl with the beautiful face.",
"She stopped, for she saw that he was not listening.",
"Everywhere he goes he holds his own.",
"What should he do in regard to her?",
"I can bear it.",
"I am never tired.",
"Tired as she was, it was some time before she could get to sleep.",
"There she pulled up and thought with all her heart and mind.",
"Also, are we not now to walk by faith?",
"Why should he not act in good faith?",
"They formed themselves into column, and set forth.",
"There his name was taken down, and in exchange for his name he was assigned a number.",
"There were the soldiers.",
"The shops were open everywhere as usual.",
"I understood that all was at an end in this district, and that we had nothing to expect from it.",
"The committee organized itself during the sitting.",
"Our hopes died away one after another.",
"Some soldiers came up.",
"The soldiers had killed every one.",
"But what was to be done, and how was the resistance to be maintained?",
"How many soldiers?",
"The door seemed to be equally closed.",
"Such a crime committed by our soldiers?",
"Several soldiers fell.",
"The soldiers went away, and no one was shot.",
"For what crimes?",
"Let us recall the facts.",
"I admit all this.",
"But how many days in the week does he work when he makes such annual earnings?",
"They must have been walking all day, for the child seemed very tired.",
"Price will not be understood.",
"Starting up, he sat on the side of his bed listening.",
"By the governor in his traffic with them.",
"Or, again, why is it that the boy himself is an advance upon the dog?",
"He could not meet his bills.",
"She would have understood some day.",
"And I was at the wedding on that day.",
"It was, when should be their wedding day?",
"Others of the house party soon joined them.",
"What a happening then!",
"He is not much worried.",
"The man, it was apparent, shared with her in the faith.",
"Such are the facts.",
"There was the bear right under it!",
"It is more than enough for a bear.",
"His father took him by the hand, and they went down and looked at the bear.",
"So I gave myself up entirely to the acquisition of knowledge, this being absolutely necessary if I was to make anything of my future career.",
"I saw my man at once, and showed him that I understood business.",
"There has been nothing like it either in its origin or its subsequent history.",
"This was part of our entertainment, and a very beautiful part it was.",
"The facts were so simple that they can be told in a few words.",
"In every other respect I was perfectly well, yet I thought it was necessary to see a doctor.",
"The greatest actor has a manner.",
"The man was not acting, and he was not an actor.",
"I speak, of course, only of serious crimes.",
"The garden has become a part of the home.",
"Right action brings rest.",
"A big bear!",
"Soon they reached the limits of the town.",
"And not content with bringing them here, they wanted to go to their homes!",
"He was perfectly certain of it, beyond all doubt and question.",
"Nobody in this country will admit, for a moment, that there can be any such thing as property in a white man.",
"After he said it, he asked himself what excuse he had for saying it.",
"She, too, was on the boat!",
"Their wedding trip, I believe.",
"No advance?",
"She accepted him as a partner and they took the floor.",
"She joined him.",
"She became aware that he was holding her from him, listening.",
"And he chose not to take it.",
"She understood his question.",
"He understood what his friend meant.",
"It was a tradition.",
"It worried him.",
"It should, however, be clearly understood that the conditions had entirely changed.",
"This task was effectively carried out.",
"But I was listening with all my might for what was to come.",
"Important business must be my excuse.",
"Somebody has come into the garden.",
"I said I was going straight to bed, I was so tired.",
"The room being on the ground floor, though rather high above the level of the garden, I thought that I could easily let myself down.",
"But I understood.",
"So I stayed quiet.",
"He completely understood where I was coming from.",
"I was tired, very tired, so I went in and sat down.",
"His vision includes things which might be, and things which never were.",
"Now, the law upon the point of minority we hold to be perfectly clear.",
"The older man looked worried.",
"Look everywhere.",
"The team tired first.",
"Now what a variety of interesting questions are opened up by these simple facts.",
"And is this all which the facts mean?",
"It remained for our race, under the teaching of both, to bring science into act and fact.",
"He has been forced to take the facts and the results on trust.",
"He has not examined the facts for himself.",
"But there are more facts in nature than these.",
"She, too, was listening.",
"He had stayed.",
"Not one of them had understood the story.",
"Their entertainment and their talk was of this sort, for an hour.",
"But now he brought to bear something which he saw that she should know.",
"A larger work, on the same ground, and by a good hand, might afford much entertainment.",
"Their faith was tried and true.",
"It was not expected that the boat would stay more than a few hours, but, for some reason, it stayed all night.",
"This boat carried the mail.",
"Everything was wrong with both of us, for they were equally hard on me.",
"The regular material used for these purposes was not to be had.",
"Then, I think, I will excuse myself for this evening and return to my room.",
"The judge cut him short and asked if he had any other evidence to advance.",
"A few words explained everything, and the parties soon understood each other.",
"Such were the facts.",
"He understood that language but too well.",
"I am not an editor, but I know the standard of a some editors.",
"Yes, it is a very great improvement.",
"The signs were indeed understood by the child but she had no time to go to the kitchen.",
"But they soon had to pass to more important things, for in these communities all kinds of things happen.",
"Now the mother ordered her to be quiet and let the thing rest.",
"Faith without works is dead.",
"Nothing can excuse it!",
"At least she knew all the facts.",
"I doubt if she ever understood them.",
"It has nothing to do with facts at all.",
"He felt glad that he had stayed.",
"How completely he had understood!",
"She had been right, perfectly right, in coming to him.",
"She looked tired.",
"Father used to fill it for her himself.",
"She had become very tired of waiting.",
"We have no boat.",
"But perhaps she keeps a boat, too.",
"If she would only let us have the boat!",
"But the door of the boat house was open and the boat was gone.",
"The doctor was seriously worried.",
"I know all the symptoms of that.",
"The garden had no answer to the question.",
"Tired though he must have been, the doctor had never felt less like sleep.",
"But every time it was harder.",
"I felt so tired.",
"She has gone to a garden party.",
"And the wedding, now, only a few days off.",
"The day before the wedding, the wedding dress came home.",
"I am tired.",
"And really she was a little tired.",
"What if the hour, the wedding hour, should not find her ready?",
"It would be a beautiful day for the wedding!",
"It was a perfect day for the wedding.",
"The girl was now beyond range of his vision around the corner.",
"However, there are the facts.",
"I can easy make excuse for coming up.",
"We find out, he and I, that we come from the same district.",
"The first reason, I believe, was due to the following facts.",
"It will raise hopes which can never be realized.",
"The man left his wife and walked toward the bear to see how close he could get.",
"We all followed in and found that the bear, although down, was still alive.",
"But hoping that they had not made me out, I kept perfectly still.",
"One of my patients tells me that it is the talk of the district.",
"Together they formed a perfect unit.",
"He understood that it was a special service.",
"But it was worth it, for indeed they were making it look like a garden!",
"This was worth listening to.",
"After that he would or would not keep faith with him, as he chose.",
"How could he ever bear it?",
"It seemed to turn away, after a little distance, from the direct line to the city, and to bear to the west, toward the river.",
"The way was divided.",
"Straight ahead was a solid wall.",
"When he had reached the top of it he thought he would lie down and try not to move again, he was so very tired and sick.",
"She had the appearance of listening to him.",
"Here then is a problem for politicians.",
"However, the small boat was waiting and took us on board.",
"The house never had a garden.",
"Our entertainment was poor, though his house was not bad.",
"There is a room built for entertainment.",
"For the entertainment of the company, said she.",
"On this simple state of facts I shall make no observation whatever.",
"We met once before, at my wedding.",
"I put my faith in the future, in the near future.",
"They understood each other perfectly.",
"We rarely stand with the feet close together, because that basis of support is too small for a firm position.",
"Fill it with fresh blood.",
"The hand will bear a degree of heat which would cause pain to some other parts of the body.",
"The eyes are then tired and need a rest.",
"He controlled himself with a great effort.",
"We are getting into the minor key again, I thought.",
"I must be everywhere.",
"At last my father got tired, and sorry too, and said he would show him a short way home.",
"They are getting tired of the world.",
"Then the giant came into the field.",
"The view we had of the country was very extensive.",
"From this point the view was extensive to the north and south.",
"The side channels of similar character, but smaller and without water.",
"Cannot bear the life she lives.",
"Brings patterns to her.",
"Now, my dear, she says, I cannot bear the life I live.",
"I had ordered a coach to the door.",
"Excuse me, my dear.",
"Still I have hopes that these will save her.",
"Why cannot I make every day equally happy?",
"Be perfectly easy, therefore, on that head.",
"I cannot bear this distance.",
"I could not hold my purposes.",
"I could say a great deal more, and all equally to the purpose.",
"I cannot bear this.",
"And then he looked harder.",
"But everywhere there was someone ahead of him.",
"But the children were losing faith.",
"But now she was going for her mother, and she could bear anything, even that.",
"The minute they were in the boat, it shot up and away towards home.",
"No regard was paid to their relationship.",
"No, faith, nor care not whether I do or no.",
"Faith, shall I tell no lie?",
"Faith, I have none.",
"Faith, who is chief?",
"Now he seems to go everywhere again.",
"She knew I had no regard for her when we married.",
"They talked of the wedding.",
"Fill my place.",
"She did not care much to dance that evening, but sat listening to the music.",
"His eyes followed the boat, and he watched it draw near to the land.",
"Certainly it worried him.",
"Damn them!",
"And there was a tiny little red thing moving in the garden, no bigger than a fly.",
"If I could do that, and know what was happening to me for but one hour, I should know everything then, and be at rest.",
"There are scores of possible channels, and it is up to us to watch them all.",
"Most of that which goes we allow to go for our own purposes.",
"He at any rate was not prepared to admit responsibility.",
"They were not politicians.",
"I do not necessarily accept those facts just as they are presented, and I may have certain views of my own on the case.",
"Perhaps I have stayed too long already.",
"He was made governor of an important city.",
"Their life was so full of minute details that they rarely appeared in public.",
"There is no fixed payment.",
"He is an active man, and works very hard in his district.",
"Half of those who originally joined it are dead.",
"Appeal to facts.",
"Rules in regard to the temperature of both the water and the air.",
"Food which the author of nature assigned.",
"What solid food should first be given.",
"Drinking cold water, while hot.",
"Reading when tired.",
"But I might appeal to facts.",
"The cases which seem to me to admit of the former, will be pointed out in the next section.",
"And yet the evil is increasing everywhere.",
"Examples of improvement.",
"Their father divided his small property equally between them.",
"These were cut in the solid rock.",
"I have made this excuse for myself.",
"Sometimes also, the variety itself is excuse enough.",
"At last, how could I bear it?",
"During this absence, I only lived in the hopes of meeting again.",
"I believe all this, because I understood it so to be.",
"They had long understood each other.",
"He is to have the whole responsibility of the case, and the whole credit of his success, if he brings it to a proper issue.",
"The case is perfectly simple, now.",
"This of itself was enough to demonstrate that fact.",
"They must be, I thought, quite at the bottom of the garden.",
"Regard us!",
"Let me, then, bear to forget her.",
"My first talk in regard to it had no reference to services in a scientific capacity on my part.",
"There was no experience to guide and no tradition to follow.",
"A small class was now formed.",
"He had a sound head, and a heart equally sound.",
"During this year a class was formed.",
"It kept happening.",
"But how of the soldiers on the other side?",
"It was clear they understood each other.",
"I must pay my bills.",
"He must bear it if she does.",
"The cool night air makes his skin smart with pain.",
"Could he bear this?",
"In the mean time a knowledge of the facts has spread through this city.",
"If he could carry out the plan he had formed, he might yet be a judge within the year.",
"Time brings all things to light.",
"He holds out his hand.",
"We stayed there some time.",
"And such a entertainment as this!",
"What though I cannot meet my bills?",
"She could not bear the voice she loved so well, at first.",
"She understood her now.",
"It was here I went and ordered dinner.",
"One can see at once that it must be an important place for such a district, but it is strange why it should be placed so high.",
"Instead, in fact, of bringing their wine to their dinner, they take their dinner to their wine.",
"The bringing out of our little book was hard work.",
"But she chose.",
"He had to admit, however, what she said.",
"Most will bear standing to.",
"Blood, he then observed, was about him everywhere.",
"There is another dream, another vision of the night.",
"His practice, never very extensive, had after a few years been given up entirely.",
"But now another actor appeared upon the scene.",
"From my window I watched the garden in front of her house, but she passed neither in nor out.",
"His presence led the conversation into other channels.",
"Such are the facts of this case.",
"They have made none, but, damn it!",
"I admit this.",
"With the improvement in his body his mind improved also.",
"Bear with me a moment and look at it.",
"What was happening behind me I could not tell.",
"Anybody in my place would have joined with them in having a good time.",
"He saw a garden.",
"Can such faith save him?",
"So he got into the boat and returned.",
"A new teaching!",
"No, but on the law of faith.",
"Nobody thought of consequences.",
"It is a terrible thing, the next day after a night of drinking.",
"It is terrible, the next day after the drinking.",
"Well, he was, and he was a giant.",
"And he must have been a giant.",
"He was a giant.",
"This is not all my own smart talk.",
"I have no excuse.",
"His whole time is divided between telling lies and writing them.",
"According to all facts and figures, failed.",
"She holds to her coffee, it appears.",
"That is, for facts.",
"But I seem to have more opportunities than I know what to do with.",
"What we have to do is to accept the facts and wait.",
"Nobody is more willing to admit it than I am.",
"But, when she calls my attention more and more to these facts, I feel that we are moving in a different world.",
"Still he had hopes for the future.",
"Therefore I should have stayed out of the case.",
"I am tired and sad, and being already in bed, have no more to do but turn out the light.",
"I am not worth an old damn.",
"But no, damn him, not he!",
"Are we artists or city men?",
"The second part offers fewer opportunities.",
"And I am not supporting that.",
"Too tired to add more.",
"I love the idea, but I could not bear the risk.",
"Is there any book which would guide me as to the following facts?",
"To bear, carry, bring.",
"To remember, bear in mind.",
"It takes a whole life to learn any language perfectly.",
"But I understood nothing of this.",
"As he was going our way we joined him, and he explained its meaning.",
"Everywhere we were told that we should never get through the country by the way we are going."],

"People crowd each other to the wall.",

"There were days when he spoke no word to me.",
"But in regard to what I was going to say about cats.",
"I am against cats.",
"We returned the next day to our camping ground.",
"Forward, and forward, is the word, and forward will be the word for centuries to come.",

"This hurt his feelings.",
"But I hate these mountains from the bottom of my heart.",
"A great mistake.",
"After a moment he spoke.",
"She went away, and I sought her husband.",
"It was a lovely dream.",
"I never make a mistake.",
"He spoke in a soft, even voice.",
"However, she left it on his plate, as if by mistake.",
"He had nothing on earth to do, and thought it would fill up the time.",
"To follow the explanation by an immediate visit was his plan.",
"Everything seemed fresh, lovely.",
"He had the baby in his mouth!",
"Here she found a crowd of people.",
"Each of us had to bring a chicken.",
"Then he spoke.",
"Suddenly a man was seen running through the crowd.",
"Then she spoke to them about fighting.",
"There they found the mission house filled with dead bodies.",
"I love no other place on earth so well.",
"Today I had a crowd of people.",
"Do not mistake me!",
"There was such a picture on the wall of the stable.",
"Now, men, the army will watch us.",
"It is, therefore, not surprising that his men loved him.",

"Her mouth moved to open and would not.",
"Losing one game they again entered the winning class.",
"But no key would enter.",
"There was a great crowd.",
"For some seconds neither man spoke.",
"He stopped dead in his walk as the notion took form in his brain.",
"She turned to him as she spoke the last words, and there seemed less trouble in her face than in his.",
"At length he spoke.",
"What he does under such a stress is no guide to his real feelings.",
"They were a hard looking crowd.",
"We finally got back to the main force, and then learned that we had made a great mistake.",
"This led me to believe that I had made a mistake.",
"Who spoke the words?",
"The narrow space immediately surrounding what had been the body was now growing to be the body itself.",
"There seems to be a mistake, here.",
"She began to talk rapidly.",
"People make a terrible mistake about this.",
"Then in thought she entered the house.",
"There must be some mistake.",
"These long days of watching have taught me that, although I began to suspect it some time ago.",
"Soft and clear the music fell about him.",
"More when snow get soft.",
"Why does he wait in the mountains?",
"Comes he not soon I must seek him among the mountains.",
"Then it was that for the first time he spoke.",
"He entered the low building on the left, leaving wide the door.",
"Dogs in the mountains.",
"Slowly she took the money, as one thinking out something.",
"Still, he may do as he lists.",
"Take care none enter.",

"But he made the mistake of looking at her first.",
"But it unfortunately happens to be the only kind of work I am capable of doing.",

"I have not the least notion how it happened.",
"So, his sister taught school, and he lived with her.",
"She entered the front room.",
"The doctor spoke.",
"We have not yet sufficient statistics.",
"Much has been written as to when and how children are to be taught to read.",
"We have had an awful time of it.",
"His own orders showed it.",
"By this time there could be no mistake.",
"The case was complicated by many details too long for notice here.",
"And then he appeared to forget my very existence.",
"It was all I sought.",
"I had sought it, and yet it had been none of my seeking.",
"She must come with us to the mountains.",
"That was the last word he spoke.",
"I think that was the most awful moment of my life.",
"The chief spoke, and asked me if my purpose still held.",
"Something not myself took hold on me, and spoke for me.",
"But now I have no way and no place on earth, and what I have to tell them will never, never be known.",
"She must have lost a stone since she went back there.",
"For months she had not entered the room which was associated with so much of her life.",
"My mother sees him always.",
"Was it some one who spoke?",
"But we are still busy upon the work of the earth.",
"The air of the earth is in my eyes, I cannot see.",
"He saw, no doubt, without any need for words, what my feelings were.",
"I turned my head as well as I could and spoke to them all.",
"A pair of the officials of the place passed as I spoke.",
"And the words he spoke were familiar words, not his, but out of the old life.",
"As for the poor soul at the open door, I had no more doubt, as I have said, of its existence than I had of my own.",
"He always says as to look over it and let the rent run on is making things worse in the end.",
"He had a letter in his hand with a very deep border of black when I came in.",
"For myself, I entered that room but little.",
"His table was covered with papers, among which were several letters with the broad black border which I had before observed.",
"The earth at the same time was rent, and she went down alive into hell.",

"Once I can find out the person or cause of his actions I can remove the effect, for I shall know just what to do.",
"A soft word!",
"Its very existence was known to few.",
"He reached the level, and entered the town.",
"And here and there through the crowd there was a spot of color where the women of the town appeared.",
"He turned to the crowd.",
"There was no need of an introduction.",
"He ground it into the floor as he spoke.",
"And she for whom he would have died he had taught to hate him.",
"She raised her eyes slowly.",
"But I took myself in hand and entered.",
"Our representative will call to explain.",
"We both sat down, and for a moment neither of us spoke.",
"Does he seek to remove me?",
"In the end he found himself with no conclusion.",
"Her mouth was hot and dry.",
"The last person who saw him, so far as we know, is his stable boy.",
"They only saw his mouth open and working.",
"He taught them many things not in their books.",
"There could be no mistake about it.",
"He lived in a long stone house.",
"Sometimes he would draw flowers.",
"But his mother would not let him finish it.",
"They built great banks of earth round it.",

"Another awful winter came.",
"But he was only a little boy in his feelings.",
"Then she taught school.",
"Stone walls do not a prison make.",
"One may be broad, another narrow.",
"The question of money was not with them so immediate.",
"I saw another at a soft spot.",
"By and by the strain was less marked.",
"A man sees only what concerns him.",
"The old man spoke at last, with an effort.",
"When he spoke, though, it was in his quiet old voice.",
"He started forward as he spoke.",
"Once I hit my foot against a stone, and fell.",
"At such rates, what must it cost to put an army in condition to move?",
"In the army the poor white has associated with the officer, far above him in social life.",
"This is regulated by the song.",
"He acts it.",
"She fell into a rapid decline and died.",
"Who can say what these things might have ended in, under other circumstances?",
"They formed slowly.",
"So on and on they went, training themselves to higher efficiency in body and mind.",
"The number is large and rapidly increasing.",
"She must do her own thinking or let women who are capable of thought do it for her.",
"The former spoke first.",
"Rapidly he opened up a big can, which he took from the bottom of his machine.",
"The thing was becoming more complicated.",
"He spoke to one of the men near him.",
"As he spoke it grew light.",
"These would indicate what had happened to it, and knowing where to look, or, rather, in what circumstances we might expect to find it, we might throw a little light on it.",
"She opened her mouth as though to speak, but no words came.",
"He sat there like a man in a dream and spoke to nobody.",
"It would be a mistake to charge him with murder until we get more evidence.",
"No woman in the circumstances would do anything of the sort.",
"Material evidence on that point would be submitted to the jury.",
"He was surprised to see me, and no mistake.",
"I did love her once, or thought so, but my feelings changed.",
"But I was not ready, not by any means ready, and he detected this when I next spoke.",
"If he saw it at all, it must have looked as cold and hard as stone.",
"It was too awful.",
"All this gave me much food for thought, but I declined to think.",
"Which did I remove first, and why did I remove any of them?",
"This, before she spoke a single word.",
"I am told that I must keep to fact, and must not express my feelings, or those of others.",
"I thought I was, but I soon saw my mistake.",
"But she was no more her natural self.",
"I must know this much at any cost to her feelings or to mine.",
"He did not finish.",
"She spoke no word to him.",
"He was coming slowly, almost falling at each step, and his face was red with blood.",
"He could feel the touch of her soft hand.",
"We have no dogs now, and will travel slowly.",
"For the first time she turned to him, and spoke his name as she put her hand on his head.",
"Slowly she began to forget that she had ever seen those things.",
"Then they entered.",
"The last of the snow went rapidly.",
"Every bone in his body gave him pain.",
"Beyond those places he did not know that there was such a thing as existence.",
"They spoke of nothing but their project great.",
"He sees.",
"In those days the animals spoke.",
"Seek someone else who can enter her hole and make her come out.",
"The earth opened and the man entered it.",
"When they had arrived down there he taught him.",
"She took it in her mouth and ran back home.",
"On the top he put a little earth and went home, but often returned to the spot.",
"They entered the city and established themselves there.",
"They entered his house.",
"Slowly his eyes closed.",
"Not a sister moved or spoke.",
"She did not finish.",
"She has no finance, she has no administration, she has no credit.",
"The national capital increases in proportion as these are increased.",
"Truth, be it only slowly, makes its way.",
"For a moment neither of us spoke.",
"No, there was no mistake, and I suddenly understood what was about to happen.",
"Leave them to finish me.",
"They have no longer the confidence in themselves which a winning army must have.",
"There has never an army gone into battle which lost such proportion of its numbers.",
"I realized that he spoke the truth.",
"Such a cool, soft little hand it was.",
"Spoke with me, and I was happy.",
"Thus we are still left without any generally accepted conclusion in the matter.",
"How on earth could they do otherwise?",
"If she did, that would seem quite natural under the circumstances.",
"That is no reason, however, why the general principle should not be applied.",
"It is all a question of relative efficiency and price.",
"Democracy will not forget it.",
"Spring and flowers have not much to say to it!",
"She on her part declined to have anything to do with them.",
"At length he sat up and knew the reason of that change that had come over the earth.",
"Then he looked back, but he could no longer see her form standing there on the stone.",
"His mouth was, I saw, hard set.",
"Neither of us spoke.",
"I must first establish the true facts.",
"It is their orders.",
"I was a marked man.",
"Everyone sought to fly.",
"His men everywhere sought safety by flight.",
"There are also many very high mountains there.",
"They must have observed that my feelings were moved, for they came between me and the officer, as if to protect the latter.",
"Everything is looking now in the direction of democracy.",
"I thought this a great mistake.",
"Only the rain still falling.",
"I asked if there were any new orders.",
"We could only go slowly and broke down now and then.",
"But this was only a very small proportion of the minimum which we required.",
"We spoke a little, but not much, of the war.",
"He certainly took it all in and marked us down on his map.",
"There was no fixed, clearly marked line.",
"It was not surprising.",
"But when he spoke, I knew it was not wine that made me sleep the whole night through.",
"Any time he chose to speak his mouth was always full.",
"As I look back on it, it was his first mistake.",
"For a moment no one spoke.",
"I knew well enough he would not let it finish in such a manner, but what could he do?",
"She did not enter the house.",
"The law of the land will establish both facts in due season.",
"The army had been surprised.",
"She taught him to read and to write, and a little to draw.",
"I think we are now prepared to see that this is a great mistake.",
"They brought word that the whole army was in that manner taking rest.",
"He therefore kept that paper, and that only, in his hand, when he entered the house.",
"It is an awful thought, the more we look at it.",
"It is an awful thought.",
"They have always had bodies here on earth.",
"For those whom they have loved on earth have bodies.",
"But this at least we know, that they have submitted.",
"Self tells him that he depends on himself.",
"Self tells him that what he has is his own, and that he has a right to do with it what he likes.",
"He is not thinking of himself all the while, but of a number of things which are outside him, circumstances which stand round him, and outside him, and are not himself at all.",
"But they enter in.",
"Why does a little child pick flowers?",
"It came to me in the course of nature or of society, and circumstances over which I had no control.",
"It is therefore not surprising that such a claim should at last have been put forward.",
"It is equally not surprising that such a claim was not allowed.",
"The only stable and independent unit was the family.",
"The stone came up quite easily and some steps appeared.",
"Then an old man came slowly around the corner of the house.",
"One of these is too hard, and the other too soft.",
"She had taken a turn for the worse, too, and began to decline rapidly.",
"I think this will be as good a pattern for orders as I can think on.",
"It is well I am getting to the conclusion.",
"We entered there.",
"The first place we entered was at the top of the little narrow court.",
"The rent was running on.",
"It was a lovely morning.",
"Payment of rent is almost unknown.",
"A lovely time we all will spend!",
"She rarely spoke.",
"Who spoke?",
"The principle of all these measures was the same.",
"He discussed them with minute care, and came to the conclusion that they were not thus to be explained away.",
"The end of the great career was rapidly coming.",
"This act of justice was approved by the army and the nation.",
"Long live the army!",
"The people learned rapidly and worked hard.",
"This was the most marked feature in her character.",
"This practice she kept up through life as far as circumstances would admit.",
"This, however, was not to be for long, and the manner of her recall was marked by interesting circumstances.",
"He is now at rest, and would not return to earth to gain the world.",
"But which should she enter?",
"She told me what a crowd these poor people had to go through, before they got into the house.",
"I far other feelings prove.",
"It had been in her voice whenever she spoke to him then.",
"No general conversation, one finds, is of much value when set down in black and white.",
"She never spoke of it to any one.",
"For half an hour no one spoke.",
"It was he who spoke first.",
"With this she walked slowly across to the window.",
"It is our secret surgery and office.",
"The music was soft again.",
"He turned slowly round.",
"But he had other diseases more or less developed.",
"He went slowly toward the door.",
"She chose a soft one, obviously.",
"He turned and entered the room.",
"Without looking round, he walked slowly on.",
"Flowers for my hair, flowers at the breast!",
"It spoke their speech.",
"No other career entered his mind.",
"He saw that it was the financial center too, and mission finance is a special science.",
"Were her shoes black or green?",
"When he had gone, my friend entered into some explanation.",
"As before, they spoke little.",
"What on earth was to be done about them?",
"As for change, let somebody change my circumstances.",
"This rule, however, may, under various circumstances, not be considered as binding.",
"Just before taking it up, add the cream.",
"In the middle of the upper stone is a round hole, and on one side is a long handle.",
"If wanted for immediate use, they will keep good a few days without being covered over.",
"It is made of entire new milk, the cream not being taken off.",
"Cream, in some diseases, cannot be replaced.",
"Simple milk is also useful.",
"Remove the person affected into the open air, and, even though it is cold weather, take off his clothes.",
"He spoke to those around him with the same confidence as before of the result of the battle.",
"That condition becomes a normal one, under the circumstances.",
"But, though I have tried for it many times, I never yet had a successful bed of flowers.",
"It must have been long and slowly growing up.",
"The mother entered now.",
"What lovely red books came out first!",
"We must finish it.",
"We have to finish it.",
"We must finish it now.",
"The mother entered.",
"It looked just too awful.",
"He let her know that he had received orders not to let anyone into the place.",
"As quickly as the circumstances allowed, he ran after his sister.",
"The poor woman only said it because she saw no immediate help for her children.",
"I tried to act on that principle and here I am.",
"His first step was to increase the regular army.",
"I spoke, I called him by name.",
"As well ask it of a stone!",
"Family parties made up the biggest proportion of this vast crowd of broken men and women.",
"Indeed there were no means of dealing with them.",
"With the assistance of the army, it was soon in control.",
"The watch he actually opened, taking as good a survey of its works as the circumstances of the case would very well allow.",
"He started off rapidly, as if to make up for lost time.",
"It was a close fit and no mistake.",
"She spoke to him directly.",
"He must have gone down with the rest that awful night.",
"Again, and again, and again, that awful dream comes to me.",
"He does not wait for orders.",
"We all know what that settlement would be.",
"Not every war finds its decision in a single great battle.",
"How little lovely here!",
"It was heard over all the earth.",
"However, he experienced no trouble.",
"We entered, and it immediately closed behind us in the same way.",
"I entered with my host a number of what we should call shops.",
"During our return neither of us spoke.",
"She spoke as she believed, if she spoke in error.",
"But we look forward to it with absolute confidence.",
"A fine rain was falling as we passed through village after village.",
"No doubt entered his mind.",
"They represented his life of hard work and fair dealing.",
"What on earth can be done?",
"Circumstances one by one had led to this drive, and in every one passed by he felt the direction of chance.",
"He entered and sat down on the bed.",
"But he had been taught to get along with little.",
"Also, when he was most concerned with trouble he usually sought her.",
"Did he imagine she was stone?",
"Had there ever in all the years of the life of the earth been so perfect a day?",
"Perhaps he had felt a stone.",
"My heart was in my mouth.",
"The officer spoke.",
"He gave his orders and passed on.",
"He spoke, too, but very soft.",
"Men are not taught right.",
"I made about half a yard during the evening.",
"I made the most natural mistake!",
"Something is due to the flowers themselves.",
"I could not have believed that such a crowd would keep still when I asked them to.",
"I suppose it would have made no difference what she had taught.",
"Whatever his men may know of what has occurred they will make no move until they get his orders.",
"My eyes again sought her face.",
"Had he gone down like a stone?",
"Just to get far, far away from people and ever so close to the big old mountains.",
"Slowly the big mouth closed.",
"He had caught her to save her from falling, he had held her for something less than a round second.",
"He was like the mountains, which were not complete without him.",
"Not to a soul on earth.",
"Then, with but one clear thought in the world, that of getting into immediate touch with her mother, she went to the telephone.",
"In a moment he spoke again.",
"For a long time neither moved nor spoke.",
"This matter would demand settlement, as well now as later.",
"These happen to be the worst of a bad crowd that ever got into these mountains.",
"She got up and moved forward slowly.",
"Neither spoke a word as they made a slow way through the snow.",
"And if it is in want of any thing, according to this it will not be the principle.",
"Is this then the principle of things?",
"Shall we then say that it is the most perfect principle?",
"For what will there be which does not participate of being?",
"The power therefore which is in us is not capable of all things.",
"Slowly over the ice they went.",
"For some time no one spoke.",
"He has orders to put the can on them and open the door.",
"No government employee could mention politics.",
"It was brief, but awful.",
"Comes he not soon, I will seek him among the mountains.",
"Will the exact number of victims ever be known?",
"Through it we enter the animal world, and are made to see as animals see, and to feel as animals feel.",
"There was a small stable there.",
"I only wanted to drive it out of the yard.",
"The stable was very quiet.",
"And I have tried to act on that principle.",
"Then she went to the kitchen and got some warm milk.",
"We each had our own plate for food.",
"The earth was cut up all around me.",
"That was a mistake.",
"We went slowly along the road.",
"For a long time this sick cat had a home in the stable.",
"What a nice, clean stable he had!",
"It was a square, white building, standing in the middle of a large yard.",
"It was a tiny stable off the main one, and it was very dark and cool.",
"I turned into the stable yard.",
"The mother submitted.",
"At last the daughter spoke again.",
"The street they now entered was a very quiet one.",
"And then she spoke.",
"I would see that they were taught the same things, and by the same method.",
"It tells us nothing of the mass of the earth.",
"It is impossible for me here to enter at length on a subject on which a whole literature has been already written.",
"But in this case it would be a mistake.",
"One finds him at every level of society.",
"He sees them go day by day.",
"It is well enough to establish types and classes.",
"It does not follow that because we are beginning to understand the normal that we are to establish one fixed absolute standard of the normal.",
"The absolute control will come.",
"How perfectly lovely!",
"The circumstances of their publication are significant.",
"That is what democracy, meant.",
"It makes democracy possible for the first time in modern history.",
"Same date, and same circumstances.",
"The same theme is continued with a further development.",
"Under these circumstances it is dangerous to attempt an explanation.",
"I thought it was awful soon for them to be getting back.",
"He was awful funny.",
"It was awful dark and still.",
"I got some ice cream in a paper, so I could eat it going along.",
"What lovely clothes she has!",
"It was the latter officer who spoke.",
"For they always spoke of people and things exactly as if they could see them.",
"It fell but a short distance, into something soft.",
"He read them off slowly.",
"In the long moment which followed, the earth might have closed on him.",
"Did he live his life upon the earth with no sign of it in his face?",
"She said lovely things.",
"How slowly I am coming to it!",
"Yes, it is about him and about my self.",
"He had a lovely wife, but she died and left him all alone.",
"Very slowly they walked toward the house.",
"I have never sought any one since.",
"Was it all a mistake?",
"The individual they mentioned will need no introduction to my old readers.",
"It was the first time there had been such cold feelings all around.",
"It is very awful.",
"Common sense taught them that.",
"But it has taught them enough.",
"It has taught them what a family means, and what a nation means.",
"And they have taught it.",
"But he made a mistake.",
"This idea was growing slowly in his mind.",
"The eyes of the big man were beginning to narrow.",
"The truth came to him slowly.",
"They might have been picked from a crowd and the one assigned to the other.",
"Only one gun spoke.",
"To this there was no immediate response.",
"She made a pretty mouth of doubt.",
"He had then but just entered life, and she was already married.",
"The place was becoming a perfect hell upon earth.",
"Thus she continued while the minutes went slowly by.",
"This house has become a perfect hell upon earth all through that child!",
"The friend he spoke of was himself.",
"The minutes slowly went by.",
"Mother earth had taken back her all.",
"But why on earth does she want to trouble me about that boy?",
"At the first words he spoke she understood him.",
"Now all at once he spoke.",
"All his technical studies marked him out for the post.",
"It was necessary to finish.",
"After this he was watched, for people came to the conclusion that he occasionally lost his head.",
"This was not surprising.",
"The minutes slowly passed away.",
"Become a democracy!",
"Go into the front yard and play ball with him.",
"Remember that they speak to his feelings when his mind is not yet open to reason.",
"But soft!",
"Well, which is the bias?",
"For rapid growth has its trials.",
"Or what else could she have done, under the circumstances?",
"He taught me.",
"It was a true democracy.",
"Democracy has many a fight before it.",
"What is the meaning of democracy?",
"The exact way in which the fighting began is not yet clear.",
"In their selection no mistake had been made.",
"The results were surprising.",
"For a moment, when the weather improved for a short time, we saw high mountains directly to the east.",
"Democracy can not be said to exist if a great portion of the people on the earth have not even political freedom.",
"It was a great and immediate success.",
"Furthermore, the officers and men of the army were receiving large increases of pay for the campaign.",
"There is no attempt here to make any application of the principle of collection at the source.",
"In these narrow streets he met no one.",
"He had, perhaps, been taught.",
"And the man who controls himself is usually able to control just so much of his surrounding world as may suit his purpose.",
"His face was rather narrow and long.",
"As he spoke the door opened and an old man came in.",
"He sees everything.",
"There was hope of a settlement of political differences.",
"He walked to the window as he spoke and looked out.",
"One sees it.",
"She might as well have sought an answer in a face of stone.",
"But it was he who spoke first.",
"Then suddenly he gave a start and sat still as stone.",
"To my knowledge this was a mistake.",
"We are content with less than absolute truth.",
"But then they had taught her nothing.",
"Our experience would lead us to quite an opposite conclusion.",
"Nobody can mistake her for another.",
"The characters were but in their introduction.",
"And what a world did I enter upon!",
"Somehow I figured my way around and got the job done.",
"Many things are obvious, when they are taught.",
"He that sees all this, sees very far.",
"Men are rich and poor, not only in proportion to what they have, but to what they want.",
"Debate on the army.",
"Was it necessary to form an army to do nothing?",
"Why was he not in such circumstances as to keep his coach?",
"Another day I spoke of one of our friends, of whom he, as well as I, had a very high opinion.",
"I knew that he sought my letter.",
"It was not surprising that he had money in the bank.",
"Very slowly she put her own within it.",
"West was thinking rapidly.",
"Brief as had been his absence, another girl had entered the room.",
"It was awful!",
"The importance of this conclusion will become more apparent as we advance in our studies.",
"There he finds himself, he has got his real job at last.",
"He announced that one without sought a private audience.",
"Another key was applied to the door by which they had just entered, with the same result.",
"Near an hour must pass before we can again remove it.",
"It had taken a strong hold on her feelings.",
"The man looked up at him slowly and seriously.",
"Slowly his eyes opened.",
"Else why on earth could a man go over!",
"They entered.",
"But it is well known that for several years I have held my present views about the existence of that body.",
"They are not able even to send money orders.",
"The stages have been fixed with a view to running the least possible risk.",
"But now I spoke.",
"Besides, my age had a great deal to do with the freedom with which they spoke to me.",
"But there was nothing surprising in this.",
"As soon as she reached another church she turned and entered it.",
"There I saw behind this narrow opening a part of the face of a woman.",
"What an awful situation mine appears to be!",
"How circumstances change!",
"The shoes were in a box and finally brought out.",
"His shoes were too small.",
"What school should he enter?",
"Then he began to slowly raise his head.",
"For weeks, he saw that awful face every time he closed his eyes to sleep.",
"Every eye turned to see who spoke.",
"It never once entered his mind that she could possibly care for him.",
"He turned slowly away.",
"Even as he spoke the door was opened and closed again.",
"Then he turned slowly around.",
"Her voice was low but not soft.",
"For a moment she was her old self again.",
"He was so sure that he would know everything the moment she spoke.",
"He fell into step by her side, and they walked slowly along.",
"The room itself was long and narrow.",
"This time there could be no mistake.",
"It was some few seconds before either of them spoke.",
"The door opened slowly towards them and closed again.",
"He wants to establish a record.",
"We entered the room.",
"When he came out of the room he spoke to the doctor in a new voice.",
"They entered the room together.",
"When he spoke again his voice had changed.",
"Her face was white as milk, but not with fear.",
"It was not until they had reached the bottom of the garden that she spoke again.",
"Without a word she turned and walked rapidly toward the house.",
"She did not finish the sentence.",
"Her mouth?",
"He would stick it out, come what may, and see the thing through to a finish.",
"There was immediate interest.",
"Under no circumstances would he leave the animals.",
"For sure that is the narrow way!",
"I no longer felt free to be myself, or to voice my own feelings.",
"Women and girls entered the room.",
"Leaving the crowd as quickly as possible, I was soon in my room.",
"I opened the second question, and from that time spoke in nearly every debate.",
"There may be some mistake.",
"Half an hour later they went slowly up the steps again.",
"Great crowd.",
"It is one of the most awful things of which I have ever heard or read.",
"No, there could not be, under the circumstances.",
"Nothing can remove it.",
"This was not true a few centuries ago.",
"May I now enter here?",
"So he rent the net, and let the men out.",
"Nothing in the world can compare with red shoes!",
"Every one was looking at her shoes.",
"An immediate meeting was necessary.",
"There was a great crowd there.",
"The soldiers had no orders.",
"I entered.",
"The ball had entered his side.",
"A crowd had formed before the door.",
"He spoke.",
"I left as I had entered.",
"A species of crowd has thus been formed.",
"I enter.",
"With the rest of the army it was otherwise.",
"The crowd could see her.",
"A fine rain was falling.",
"He spoke to me as though we had seen each other yesterday.",
"He did not finish it.",
"To finish with them once for all!",
"Nor do I know upon what other principle or right they can support it.",
"As to the rent for the personal services, it is not mentioned.",
"It now became a fight to the finish.",
"It was a lovely evening in early spring.",
"I know him, let him enter.",
"How familiar the yard seemed to him!",
"Finally she spoke.",
"His mother entered.",
"At last, when he had fully realized it all, he spoke.",
"He thought rapidly himself now.",
"It was an awful night for him.",
"He thinks of one awful day and night.",
"My challenge was declined.",
"I can find no words in which to express my feelings.",
"I will pass over details, and come to the conclusion of the investigation.",
"These were also submitted for analysis.",
"That is a matter of principle.",
"This mail, just before pay day, when the crowd is usually hard up, brings a good many money letters from friends.",
"He ran rapidly up to an open window at the side of the house.",
"There could be no mistake.",
"Suppose she finds it out?",
"Their parents, in most cases unable to give them numerous books, had, in almost every instance, taught them to love reading.",
"Is not this because we have taught them, not only to read, but to read for a diversity of reasons?",
"People would, of course, argue that, under the circumstances, the unknown criminal would be among those to leave the train at the first opportunity.",
"Was it she whom he sought?",
"How slowly time went.",
"The girl spoke no more.",
"There had been many in the past who had sought her favor.",
"In the moving picture he was running away from a crowd.",
"Of course she knew even as she spoke why he could not, or would not.",
"Could he have made a mistake?",
"It was far from the border.",
"No, for the present she must take orders.",
"He might as well go through to a finish.",
"He knew the man with whom he was dealing.",
"Neither of the others spoke.",
"They rarely spoke.",
"He saw them coming back and gave me his shoes.",
"He himself had forced the circumstances that made it impossible to let him live.",
"There is, perhaps, just one other point upon which I might touch in conclusion.",
"But I had not taught him the language.",
"The girl was very lovely.",
"One general rule for progress in big business concerns is the introduction of new blood.",
"The man who does not know how to receive orders is not fit to issue them to others.",
"I never actually hurt their physical bodies.",
"Unless a man sees this clearly for himself how can he show it to others?",
"But their bias is towards great subjects.",
"Let a man look for himself and tell truly what he sees.",
"She sees what the children do not, or cannot see.",
"But I need not enter at any length upon this subject of treatment.",
"Are not both methods right under different circumstances?",
"To suppose so is to mistake the materials for the building.",
"I long to be again on the mountains.",
"A mistake.",
"But it did not enter his head just then that he might be capable of making history.",
"Of course, he sees it now.",
"After that time a rapid change began.",
"It is an awful problem.",
"But she looked in her plate.",
"He was eating very slowly.",
"He entered upon a pretty scene.",
"This she filled with milk.",
"She must, she must participate.",
"But she passed her plate.",
"They did so, and she followed, and did not know where to look, and thought of her broken shoes.",
"And then it was all a mistake.",
"Rent, I mean.",
"They were never left long in the yard.",
"But flowers had no such sale there as have our flowers here in the north.",
"The people there did not seem to care for flowers as we do.",
"I made enough to keep us and pay our room rent.",
"Words failed me to express my feelings at this news.",
"Eat slowly.",
"Under such circumstances the party started.",
"It is not my legal name, and I shall soon be called on to perform legal acts.",
"Yes, the man we seek is already found, his features rapidly becoming distinct.",
"He spoke about the flowers and the music.",
"This brings us to another view of the subject, which may serve for conclusion.",
"Besides, his mind had received new ideas while he was in the army.",
"She has been walking so ever since she entered it.",
"I spoke to her.",
"Though I am not and never was an editor, I know something of the trials to which they are submitted.",
"Not but that it was a natural conclusion.",
"The light there was soft and green.",
"It was a mistake, from the very beginning, a mistake.",
"Merely a man speaking the exact truth.",
"But feelings are so difficult to put into words.",
"As no one outside knew of its existence it was considered quite safe to keep it in the house.",
"What was this love he spoke of?",
"Slowly the girl turned to him.",
"His final decision came one morning when driving slowly home from an all night fight with death.",
"Men are awful easy taken in.",
"She did not see him as she came slowly across to the table.",
"The risk is too awful.",
"To me she has never been so lovely.",
"He walked slowly.",
"And she grew old and her flowers fell to pieces.",
"She declined to go anywhere.",
"Similar orders were sent to the train.",
"It was chicken or nothing.",
"He sought for a word.",
"I assumed that they knew what to do under such circumstances.",
"Nobody would ever buy stock in it or even finance it.",
"I have decided to write to the owners of the house and request an immediate investigation.",
"And, looking at the page, she saw that she had marked her own name.",
"Neither spoke.",
"He came slowly across the room to the table on which she was sitting.",
"But if that is done why should all the world participate?",
"This is a serious mistake.",
"They made a mistake.",
"She would have submitted.",
"And now this bear turned and began moving slowly toward cover.",
"In the afternoon a black bear appeared not far from our camping place.",
"For almost a half hour he never moved, except to slowly turn his head.",
"The mountains being covered with fresh snow in the morning, there was nothing to do but eat and sleep.",
"This is a great mistake.",
"I have never claimed one.",
"It was only when he spoke of his own subject that his face was filled with life and soul.",
"We should have seen the yard before they had taken it in hand!",
"Or turns the rapid current?",
"It was set well back from the street, and a stone walk led up to the front door.",
"He spoke of the beautiful weather.",
"Some one came into the room and spoke to her.",
"For many minutes no one spoke.",
"Then, the judge spoke.",
"After a little he heard some one enter and walk across the floor.",
"It was declined.",
"A new thought was working slowly into his mind.",
"He had reached the conclusion that it would not.",
"He spoke generally of law and justice, and particularly of the weight of evidence in the case at bar.",
"Behind him the door was opened and some one entered the room from the street.",
"Then another man entered at the open door.",
"At last he spoke.",
"Having marked out his course he began to follow it.",
"He walked slowly up the plane.",
"For, although he walked very slowly, he grew tired very easily.",
"He knew, now, which way to turn, and he passed down it in what he thought was rapid flight.",
"But he thought he was going very rapidly.",
"He looked up at the face of the fall and then the truth came slowly into his mind.",
"This is an awful subject.",
"I then entered upon religious conversation.",
"He spoke strongly of the influence which a man has by being rich.",
"There are yet no mountains.",
"I have just been giving the necessary orders.",
"But what could a man do under the circumstances?",
"We all change with circumstances.",
"Though he spoke as a boy, he looked like a man.",
"It was I who taught her that new way of doing her hair.",
"We are now to take up a new study, and in a field quite different from any we have thus far entered.",
"Our bodies, also, move themselves, either one part on another, or the whole body from place to place.",
"It is absolutely necessary for continued existence.",
"Such bodies are called cells.",
"So with our bodies.",
"How, then, is the efficiency of the blood maintained?",
"Remove the person to the open air and place him on his back.",
"Marked with fine lines.",
"At length she spoke of the decision which was expected from her that night.",
"These are the children who, when they became men, tried to keep up the character which they had been previously taught to play.",
"His mind has some new principle of order.",
"Experience has taught him so much.",
"But the house did not sell or rent.",
"This time he believed, and said it would follow her until she spoke to it.",
"After a while we asked them for a drink of milk.",
"And she did another thing, she took off one of the shoes that was on his feet.",
"Her observations on the cold conclusion of them.",
"They will make me, as I tell them, hate their house, and remove from it.",
"I cannot but call this, my circumstances considered, an happy day to the end of it.",
"He would enter upon no subjects of conversation but what I should lead to.",
"But the children had been playing hard all day, and their bodies were tired.",
"But after a minute she spoke again.",
"They ran to meet her and tell her not to leave any more milk until they should come back.",
"Here it is music without any theme, like the music we dance to.",
"He thought her large serious eyes were looking into his, and her long black hair falling over his face.",
"This was the immediate cause of her visit.",
"That it had not resulted more seriously was due to a combination of circumstances.",
"I shall pass rapidly over the next few days, for nothing of moment happened.",
"There was a lovely spring just across the road.",
"Then she spoke.",
"This was a typical country settlement, and the girls only remained one night.",
"The door opened, apparently without assistance, and they entered the apartment.",
"Give me the flowers.",
"The cream is sweet.",
"They entered what seemed to be a kitchen.",
"Never ask me for orders.",
"He spoke to the doctor, and at a sign from him, our host took a gun and led me into his garden.",
"Neither of them spoke.",
"I have sought her everywhere.",
"As he spoke I set my gun against his breast.",
"Unable any longer to contain myself, I came across the yard.",
"Small shoes they were.",
"The room he entered was a large one.",
"Which was not surprising.",
"My mistake.",
"All a mistake.",
"A man entered.",
"His eyes began to narrow.",
"The latter had been marked for death at the time.",
"He neither spoke nor gave a sign.",
"The ground plan of the house was almost an exact square.",
"At that distance it looked very narrow.",
"Slowly his arms went above his head.",
"Please do not remove it.",
"But all under the window spread a tree, with great leaves and sweet white flowers, almost as big as his head.",
"And still he thought he could throw a stone into the garden.",
"It was all a mistake.",
"But the professor had not the least notion of allowing that things were true, merely because people thought them beautiful.",
"The walls of this building were built on an entirely different principle, which need not be described, as it has not yet been discovered.",
"My job was done when I had got the flowers perfect.",
"And, besides, he sees that this second case, so exactly like the first, makes the solution of his problem very much more easy.",
"I had seen too many during my service to make any mistake about that.",
"An hour passed slowly.",
"He is entirely free from any sense of proportion.",
"The man and girl talked together for a few minutes, and then walked slowly arm in arm out of the station towards the village.",
"At least so I understood the orders given in a strange sea language.",
"He has no sense of proportion.",
"It is the same in the more complicated operations of life.",
"One never sees them elsewhere.",
"For some time neither of us spoke.",
"It can only be said that they may be, and that some of the circumstances suggest that they are.",
"Under the present circumstances, I think not.",
"No one saw him enter the house.",
"We walked on slowly, her arm linked in mine, and for a while neither of us spoke.",
"And yet it would not be evidence that could be used to establish identity.",
"He even allows women to enter it.",
"He carried into practice all the rules he taught.",
"The head of a family had not only absolute control over wife and children, but the power of life and death.",
"Probably there is a mistake in the figures.",
"After his death the decline was rapid.",
"He entered the city in the course of the next day, and was at once led to the presence of the governor.",
"Private interests and family requirements have probably regulated the size of them.",
"We like the transition.",
"However, under the circumstances it was decided to accept the offer.",
"The day schools are in a good state of efficiency, and are of great service to the district.",
"Into their history the elements of a vast change enter.",
"Cats and dogs.",
"Their diseases.",
"Shoes useful.",
"Diseases thus produced.",
"Mistake of one class of men.",
"As to shoes, there is some variety of opinion among medical men.",
"But this is a mistake.",
"This is a leading and important principle.",
"Some parents allow dogs and cats to sleep with children.",
"This must be determined by circumstances.",
"And I cannot help coming to the same conclusion.",
"There is hope, however, under the last circumstances.",
"Many stories develop the same theme but none just like this.",
"He sees himself now as he never saw himself before and begins to take stock of his moral assets.",
"I had awful trouble in getting it.",
"Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length.",
"Acts which caused damage to another opened a new class of cases.",
"But these were not the women whose society was most sought.",
"The changes in conditions have come very rapidly and a good deal of experiment will be necessary to find out just what government can do and ought to do to meet them.",
"First, it is representative.",
"Here, every one is a proper judge of what he sees.",
"In the other circumstances he was exact enough.",
"That cannot be, because not capable!",
"Of these a numerous crowd is formed.",
"In order to understand it, we must go back almost to its introduction.",
"She spoke no more.",
"So far, the circumstances of the case are perfectly clear.",
"What is the natural conclusion to draw from the conversation which I have just set down?",
"I got out, and, followed by one of my men, entered the church.",
"She pointed to the account as she spoke.",
"The talk ran upon mountains.",
"They will take up arms for a principle, but they must have confidence in each other and in their leaders.",
"I suppose it may be so when we enter a future life.",
"The stone is ancient error.",
"The image of the earth did not yet show itself.",
"So I am here, and wait, and know every hour will remove them.",
"She came back to earth.",
"The walls are of stone, which makes us think of our last home.",
"One finds them always, but one rarely sees them fall.",
"In fact, I became really quite experienced for those times in such matters.",
"Being directed, we soon found the place and entered.",
"And in conclusion, he reported the items of business they had considered, and the action taken in each case.",
"His style of speech was clear, distinct and rapid.",
"The boy sat down with his back to the crowd.",
"As a matter of fact, it is much more important to be taught how to drive than how to ride.",
"He never thought to a finish.",
"Private service at the house, and a great crowd at the church.",
"The earth is all before me.",
"The miles are marked on the map.",
"See how they dance among the flowers!",
"The law and the army are closely followed by the church.",
"She had never sought him.",
"She spoke low.",
"If she were present no one spoke to her, or noticed her.",
"A crowd collected round him.",
"I told her it would be a job to take care of a child in that big crowd.",
"But I declined the treat.",
"How many of the common soldiers who make up the great body of the army know or care about the right or wrong of their cause.",
"Would use such awful terms.",
"He had been taught so.",
"In such cases it very often goes for nothing, and then it is a perfect chance which way a person acts.",
"A crowd of figures came about them from the house.",
"Perhaps if she sees me, it may give her new heart.",
"They spoke not a word either to me or to one another.",
"While eating my dinner I wanted a small plate and asked for it.",
"I went into the stable, to see what I could see.",
"The choice of subject was an entire mistake.",
"Only for that he must see just how he had figured to her.",
"On this slowly she turned to him.",
"Please do not remove this.",
"So much then for the love of self.",
"I sought someone whom I had never seen, yet knew that I should recognize when found.",
"The next day I entered a large town which I shall not name.",
"The play was rapid.",
"I have a notion, too, that my girls are worth knowing.",
"There he looked at his watch, then entered the square.",
"A man entered the square and came along the walk toward me.",
"All entered.",
"He was stone dead.",
"Turning in my seat I saw a man in evening dress who had just entered the room.",
"To continue then with the cats.",
"What a lovely morning!",
"I never spoke.",
"What I mean is, could I be taught how to say what is appropriate?",
"At last she spoke, but what she said was not what she at first had intended to say.",
"Who taught him?",
"The crowd went wild.",
"Falling water was everywhere.",
"The variables were truly variable.",
"And everybody sent us flowers.",
"There were flowers everywhere, flowers, flowers, flowers, without out end.",
"I did not want any mistake.",
"But he kept his mouth open and let me pull.",
"And he sat down and taught the people from the boat.",
"And a large crowd from the city was with her.",
"For who hopes for what he sees?",
"But I made no mistake.",
"I am the last man, and I was not glad to be at the finish.",
"But I spoke true.",
"But he claimed he could not.",
"Never mistake them in the world.",
"Never having seen the mountains, there are no mountains.",
"Is it efficient to prevent crime?",
"Well, we have seen plenty of mountains at home.",
"We used to go to the mountains every summer.",
"We are familiar enough with the mountains.",
"Everything taught shall be understood.",
"I wish to try a more direct and, as I believe, a more efficient method.",
"Nobody else entered.",
"He had turned his head to watch her, but when she was gone his eyes again sought his mother.",
"Her manner was wild, but not more so, I think, than was natural under the circumstances.",
"Yes, with him he would go to the ends of the earth!",
"She cannot move rapidly because she is so.",
"Great bodies move slowly.",
"So in any other part of the earth.",
"There would be cats in my home too if I could but get it.",
"One sees it is a new country, they are so free with their water.",
"This is a lovely place, which I am growing to love.",
"The religious conditions are wild, unknown, very surprising.",
"Weather lovely.",
"But here is my notion to make all clear.",
"The garden, which is above, is lovely, and will be cool in summer.",
"I now come to the conclusion of this matter.",
"Can I finish it for next mail?",
"This introduction of it will take a long while to walk about!",
"For how many centuries did literature get along without a sign of it?",
"My work goes along but slowly.",
"Earth, ground.",
"A stable.",
"I entered into conversation with him.",
"I reached the same conclusion from a totally different point.",
"It does seem as though there must be some mistake, but mistake there is none.",
"In such a community, it is sometimes the representative of labor, and sometimes of violence.",
"There was not a house clean enough to rest in, so I sat on a stone and thought about the people for over an hour.",
"Their love for their children was most marked."],

["When I had concluded I looked around me.",
"I was rising, rising.",
"From there, I transferred my attention to the study door.",
"I felt confused.",
"God, do they, and does such a thing really exist?",
"I have a feeling, that there is more in this last affair, than in all those others.",
"No such extreme measures, however, were ever carried out.",
"I saw her very often and always found her most attractive.",
"What does it promise, for the help or hope of man?",
"This is not a right interpretation of life.",
"God leads us on.",
"God did it.",
"Beauty is in and about the place in which one thinks and works.",
"About the places where we work, we should have, as far as possible, something of the beauty of the world.",
"Why do mothers often look so tired?",
"The windows of their houses were different from any I had ever seen before.",
"With that exception, he said, the number appeared to be nearly the same every year.",
"And as my person grew and developed with my increasing years, so also grew and developed my beauty.",
"Her face expressed extreme fear.",
"The latter had taken no part in the affair.",
"Why should they desire to do so?",
"Not knowing exactly what weight lay behind it, I called up all hands.",
"My own ideas were somewhat confused.",
"Now that was a promise, which, while it was rarely made, was never broken.",
"This is a joke.",
"The reader may mix to his own taste.",
"The door of communication between us is shut.",
"But there was no time to waste.",
"There was an attractive force about him, difficult to describe, and which only those who knew him could understand, for he was nothing if not original.",
"Promise me that.",
"She took it out of her bag.",
"God is on my side.",
"She knew he had some of the medicine.",
"It seemed as though her eyes were hardly shut, before she heard a voice calling her.",
"The people were very much interested in the black children she had adopted and brought with her.",
"She took along one of the boys she had adopted.",
"She decided to go and take her adopted children with her.",
"Its frequent traffic is its insurance.",
"Is the great round sun stuck?",
"Or a touch of beauty gets me.",
"I will try and show briefly how it came about.",
"From this time he became drawn towards mission work in that district.",
"He visited the sick, and helped them.",
"Later on, for leaving an hotel without paying, he was put in prison, and had to stay there till the money was sent for his release.",
"Her very presence was medicine and food and light to the soldiers.",
"Last chance to beat the draft.",
"God knows I give up!",
"It was as if her heart lay suddenly very still in her breast.",
"She lay against him.",
"Lay off!",
"He lay back slowly.",
"I promise.",
"In fact he rather declined to discuss the affair.",
"He simply stated the facts without comment.",
"It was really a serious state of affairs.",
"This race was rather a novel affair.",
"I further informed him that there was a great chief from across the water who was coming there to visit him.",
"But the way I have related the affair is the correct version.",
"The present regulations in regard to degrees had not then been adopted.",
"The world moves.",
"I take warning by her.",
"The reader will be able to judge, from this, whether we are familiar with the literature of our day, or not.",
"Just in his prime.",
"The lovely face took on an added beauty.",
"He opened several papers as he spoke and ran his eyes over the advertising columns.",
"Besides, he had no thought of dying for years.",
"But he did not offer to release her from her promise.",
"God understood.",
"And the beauty of it is he never seems to think of himself at all.",
"He shut his eyes.",
"He lay quite still.",
"That he was really going to lie there till he died?",
"Here was luck!",
"Her mouth began to look drawn.",
"Now his vision dropped to the level of faces at the door.",
"A very frequent phrase.",
"Men such as he was take what they desire.",
"For, at this period, games, whenever possible, are in common, and develop the feeling and desire for community, and the laws and requirements of community.",
"He gets not more but less beauty when he must sit in a class and answer formal questions.",
"Also we can notice what the children did not desire.",
"The meat was supposed to be tough.",
"It is true that these children appear to spend most of their time in formal work.",
"The sun rising and setting in the north.",
"In low water it barely projects above the surface.",
"It is deep enough for all ordinary purposes.",
"The first reference has nothing to do with affairs of state.",
"Nor would the telling of it prove interesting to the reader.",
"Just too late the warning came.",
"I did not waste time in getting to work.",
"His face grew dark, till he looked like the man I had seen the night before.",
"It was my own affair, which I must go through with alone.",
"If we could find a way clear to the top we might stay there in some security, till we learned the issue of the war, and could get word to our friends.",
"I watched by him till the dark fell, and long after.",
"I should go on till I died, and I did not think that would be very long.",
"I might have known it would bring me bad luck.",
"The room was large, too, and there were windows at one end only, and that toward the north.",
"Must she bear it, and I bear it, forever, and no means, no way of setting it right?",
"Is it a warning?",
"Her soul was confused with wonder and fear.",
"In the bed there lay a child whom she knew.",
"And there he lay, and was about to die.",
"And when a man will not, and will not till the day is over, what can be done for him?",
"What was this where I lay?",
"It was not till some time later that I understood why.",
"And was this to last forever?",
"They had served like myself as objects of experiments.",
"Were we not fixed here forever, where our lot had been cast?",
"On, on, across the waste!",
"This was the oldest part of all.",
"To be clear about the cause of it was not my grand desire.",
"But after all, though it gave me a shock for a moment, what did that matter?",
"However, as I returned home, something happened which put the joke entirely out of my head.",
"As usual, I did not see my father till dinner.",
"We used to say to each other that it was forever, that we never could be but one, that it was for life and death.",
"I, for my part, felt that my message was delivered.",
"In his home life he was not formal in his manner.",
"Is an exception to be made here?",
"Truly this is a very perfect beauty!",
"The description of the weather did not sound attractive.",
"He was no beauty, and his behavior was worse than his looks.",
"They passed into the house, and the door was shut.",
"Really, for all I know, he may be dying.",
"She saw that he was trying to rise from his seat, but that he had barely the strength to achieve his purpose.",
"They would shut him up, kill him perhaps!",
"He would have warning enough if anyone turned the key now.",
"Everyone followed him and the crowd at the windows joined the group outside.",
"This defense seemed to surprise them, for they fell back a little toward the windows.",
"Every step they come upon the dead and dying.",
"How little of the ordinary association the word brought up!",
"Beyond that I can promise nothing.",
"All the world is a small affair to her compared with our poor boy.",
"God knows he has enough to answer for without that!",
"I want to help my husband so he will fall in love with me to make home beautiful, attractive and comfortable.",
"How I worked to make home attractive.",
"This was no exception.",
"As from the first, I shall lay my cards upon the table.",
"And now, what he wanted most of all was gone from him, he felt, forever.",
"One would have thought that she was in the very act of rising.",
"It was a strange question to ask, for by raising his eyes he could have seen.",
"They are all pretty good, and one is a thing of beauty.",
"It will be delivered in the morning.",
"The harder the job, the more he is drawn to it.",
"It is a sign of promise that the demand for reading matter of interest to the child has come from teachers.",
"He did not waste his time.",
"One winter night she went out to get some meat.",
"The white men bought this when they could not get meat.",
"Then they would have plenty of meat.",
"He shut his eyes for a moment.",
"He even thought that his other pair of shoes would be put away till his little brother grew big enough to wear them.",
"His feet were drawn up out of the way.",
"Is there any such thing as luck?",
"Are the courts equally just to labor and capital?",
"To what profit?",
"In the second they may easily be confused with each other.",
"The human race as a whole has been reading faces through the centuries.",
"The door, however, was shut.",
"In fact, I mean to use the thing to test my luck.",
"Perhaps he ought to go on, but he meant to take the extra few minutes luck had given him.",
"One felt they must shock, but they did not.",
"He forced himself to examine the plate the other indicated.",
"Luck had given him a hard job, but he had put it across.",
"Nature thus keeps use and beauty distinct.",
"The story of a life lay in the look.",
"She shut the loss up in her own heart.",
"Why, it was a happy promise!",
"God could not lie to her!",
"How the windows open, and the fresh air comes in!",
"Her beauty was lovely now.",
"I looked at the fair, beautiful face that lay so near to my eyes.",
"In the operation of this joint concern, both the money of the nation and the lives of the men are put at risk.",
"She watched it from the city walls till she could bear it no longer.",
"We were patient, too long patient, perhaps, with challenges.",
"Men entered the army and were employed as soldiers only.",
"It is different, and in nothing more so than in its attitude toward its women.",
"They knew her people must be employed.",
"He needed some one to suggest changes in process from time to time, and to watch waste.",
"In what capacity employed?",
"How long employed?",
"Raising his head slightly, he could see no human form.",
"The man dropped to the bottom of the boat and lay still.",
"I was drawn under.",
"I know how to keep my mouth shut.",
"His conduct would bear that interpretation if she had happened to be guilty.",
"It was the shock that killed her.",
"I closed the door behind me, but I did not shut it.",
"I have felt the shock.",
"What luck!",
"When the door finally opened, it came as a shock.",
"Wait till tomorrow, dear child.",
"We had discussed the situation till there seemed to be nothing left to discuss.",
"I had not even the desire to do so.",
"The beauty he liked is gone.",
"The light was now in our faces, and I had a perfect view of his.",
"Never had he wanted to kill as he felt the desire in him to kill now.",
"But a wind was rising.",
"While he was almost half dog, the wild had claimed him forever.",
"The club lay between him and the man.",
"I have come to pay this woman a visit and desire to see her.",
"She took a club and gave it to him till he had had enough.",
"They had visited every place except the sea.",
"The weight of the shock passed.",
"But this turned out the most difficult part of the affair by far.",
"Somehow, as I was speaking, I had drawn her toward me, and my arm was around her.",
"I had barely time to get back to my post at the front door when they were upon us.",
"And such beauty!",
"Then the rest lay, quiet again.",
"We had no luck with the weather.",
"We were ready to meet a fresh effort, but the strength with which it was delivered surprised everybody.",
"But up till now, it remains a chapter unique in the history of war.",
"A reaction is always an extreme.",
"I had given her my promise, and I intended to keep it.",
"Show him my letter, and tell him from me that through it all I have kept my promise, and that the secret is still safe.",
"Yet could she have received some warning that the police were in search of her?",
"These things that have been done are thus briefly related.",
"Define them.",
"But it was my luck to see a good deal during that time.",
"And, when I arrived, gas was not much employed on either side.",
"One gun will remain in action till the last.",
"All our party got in somehow and lay down to sleep.",
"They were standing about, with a half lost look on their faces.",
"I told him they were getting near now, but stuck fast in the traffic.",
"It was only by good luck that a number of my own men were not in that house at the time.",
"It was a scene of wonderful beauty.",
"It was in many ways a very interesting sector.",
"He could get no observation here except by aircraft.",
"The first time it was issued to them, they thought it was medicine.",
"I am sorry, my son, that we must wait till later in the day to exchange ideas.",
"Why does he wait till now?",
"His warning, however, was late in coming.",
"We should meet, and it would be different from our other meetings.",
"Well, we are off, and may the paper stay still till we get it.",
"To him the whole thing seemed an ordinary piece of business.",
"Indeed, the whole affair seemed such a part of his daily life as to demand nothing unusual.",
"But this is no ordinary murder.",
"Somehow, this simple thing seemed to shut him out of her life.",
"This beer is very good for a country village.",
"This was no ordinary crime.",
"For the rest, he is alone, shut off from the world.",
"When they looked up, they were very large, odd, and attractive.",
"At least he had not visited it for a long time.",
"There is no exception to this in either ancient or modern times.",
"This man was brought in and delivered up.",
"It is not that they are afraid of the pain of dying.",
"Lay it to heart, I say, and believe that what is right, and therefore good, for the next life, is right, and therefore good, for this.",
"Till they trust him and love him, they will not listen to him.",
"God is everywhere.",
"God is not just and equal.",
"He gives the same warning to both.",
"God made it so.",
"God is love.",
"For this is the usual interpretation.",
"And as for the church, I can never hope to tell of all its interest and beauty.",
"They are gone, but others we have since acquired, though less fair by far, remain.",
"Nothing is so perfect as she is, nothing more lovely and attractive.",
"God knows how I got him out, but I did.",
"Another hour was spent in looking in at the shop windows.",
"God send not!",
"Joke the second I make.",
"But we all hope that these letters may be waste paper.",
"I had rather it had been told me, the reader, at once.",
"But why waste a wish on him?",
"But they must come into it in time, or their leaves be waste paper.",
"I came home forever!",
"There were few people at the shop windows, and fewer inside.",
"But the promise failed him when the time came.",
"This room was the first place we visited.",
"There were a few healthy plants in the windows, and everything gave evidence of industry and care.",
"She was visited.",
"God help the poor!",
"Well, good luck, my little friend.",
"Deaths of individuals, of husband and wife, of entire families, were becoming common.",
"They were so informed.",
"But some of our children got out through the windows, the rest through a little door into the garden.",
"I once thought it impossible to bear his loss, but none know what they can bear till they are tried.",
"A further trouble was that from morning till night she was never alone.",
"The observation gave a shock to her sensitive soul.",
"She little thought that they would indeed meet on that day, but only to lay her remains to rest.",
"But this was always her excuse for not reading any of the books I recommended.",
"From the first he had come under the influence of her beauty.",
"There are some women whose desire it is to be all things to all men instead of every thing to one.",
"It is like the line that is drawn between us and our dogs.",
"He brought them food and medicine.",
"But these objects were few and far between.",
"I studied medicine with that view.",
"One can never tell what the effect of an acquired desire may be.",
"I could see by their faces.",
"From his attitude it was apparent that he was listening.",
"God made the world for the poor man as well as for the rich.",
"God knows it is difficult for men to do always the right thing.",
"They made no sign, but watched the faces of their leaders.",
"We will pay him more to shut it.",
"Moreover, muscle, once made, remains till death.",
"They were completely shut in.",
"God knows I am not asking for him any thing that he would be afraid to ask for himself.",
"It does not live by continuing to mean the some thing.",
"Some are almost artists in their feeling for beauty in their work.",
"I have had long experience in these affairs.",
"She informed them that her husband was not at home.",
"But the next morning, long before church time, he received warning enough of what was going to happen.",
"The luck gives in first.",
"They kept this attitude for the rest of the day.",
"Do not open it till cold.",
"Do not strain it unless absolutely necessary, as it causes so much waste.",
"Cover up with fresh leaves, and let the whole remain till quite cold.",
"Meat, also, after having been cut into very small pieces, was treated in the same manner.",
"The reverse way, as shown in the cut, is that most usually adopted.",
"Take it out and lay it in cold water.",
"Take it out, lay it on a table, and pull off the hair as quickly as possible.",
"Let them eat meat and drink milk, or half a glass of light beer.",
"The band should be kept on the part during the whole of the time that these means are being adopted.",
"Then lay him on his back, with his head slightly raised.",
"It happened that he had to see several, far in the country, and so did not come home till late at night.",
"When I knew that he was forever lost, I first knew what he had become to me.",
"The government of the many by the few is the rule, and not the exception, in the politics of the times that have been and of those that now are.",
"God knows.",
"This is a great deal to promise or perform, but it is not all that is expected of him.",
"The solution has not come, and now the hopes are dead or dying.",
"He never adopted an opinion for the reason that it had been adopted by another.",
"From time to time he tried to open his eyes, but they always fell shut again.",
"Such rich and heavy meat for a sick man!",
"We are not allowed to see her just yet, but I can hardly wait till she comes down.",
"She could wait on them, and what more could they desire?",
"These columns have probably been standing here for centuries.",
"It is one of the very oldest buildings in the city.",
"The draft took care of the army.",
"Our route lay over an open field covered with dead.",
"We got some beer and wine just the same.",
"The sun was rising.",
"Lots were quickly drawn.",
"As they met in the shock they recognized each other.",
"One man lay deep in his blood.",
"The further from the front the fewer the deaths, because so many have died already.",
"I know not how it is, but I seem, as it were, to have bought more beer than I can drink.",
"Affairs are now at such a pass, that it is necessary to act.",
"All alone as he is it will give us warning, and we may reach him in time to be of service.",
"Not far did we go till we came on something.",
"On one of the rising places around me I saw something dark move along, then another, and another.",
"It must have occurred just before the dinner hour, for no one noticed their absence till the men had returned.",
"He shut his eyes again and again, but each time the vision, if it was a vision, or the reality, if it was a reality, would rise before him.",
"God help us!",
"He paid no particular attention to the sentence at the time, but it stuck in his memory.",
"He shut them up for a few days and worked harder than ever, if that were possible, to try to please them.",
"It was not, therefore, till he had heard her story that I saw him.",
"In this case neither course can be adopted.",
"If they do not afford an explanation which scientific medicine will admit, I can suggest no other.",
"That is all we desire.",
"Our hospitals do not admit the dead.",
"Simply stated this is cause and result.",
"They looked down at their plates and said nothing.",
"No surprise showed, but faces grew set and hard.",
"He lay on his back.",
"This war never has come close till now.",
"But the truth was that he was leaving his home forever.",
"God knows it must be real enough!",
"He got up and, opening his bag, he took out some papers.",
"Promise me.",
"No part of his right side moves!",
"Changes are going on in me, some of which I am unable to define.",
"I stayed up till I dropped.",
"More deaths came from these causes than from war.",
"But the name stuck.",
"The luck might be with the soldiers left behind.",
"To his left somewhere the earth received a shock.",
"He shut his eyes, but that did not shut out what he saw.",
"I was surprised at her feeling any desire to see me.",
"Both of these are very frequent.",
"Who objects?",
"I took no part in these affairs, which at one time became serious.",
"God helping me, I would try!",
"Yet such an opportunity might develop, and my one hope lay in being prepared, and ready.",
"God, no!",
"Had she received my note of warning?",
"I shut the door behind us, and turned the key.",
"Just now I must have him on my side, and conditions had delivered him into my hands.",
"They meant to pull the affair off either today or tonight.",
"Luck has given us a chance to make a break, and get away.",
"First thing I knew he was gone, leaving me holding the bag, as they say.",
"But briefly and long, long ago.",
"But very briefly.",
"My god here goes.",
"All day long she had tried to see what lay under the surface.",
"His desire went out of him.",
"She thought that she was dying.",
"She sought to hear their words, to read the looks on their faces.",
"He closed his eyes and lay very still.",
"God had heard her.",
"It was well he had heard her and could sound the warning.",
"His mind had been too full of his own affairs.",
"I was wild with the beauty of it!",
"And what is our attitude to be?",
"He sat still till I brought it to him.",
"Then she lay down again.",
"Their faces looked sad, and they kept very quiet for a few minutes.",
"We took dogs and worried him, and ran him from one place to another, and shot at him, till at last he dropped.",
"She soon adopted it.",
"God will require an account of those deaths at the hands of the men who put up that building.",
"I looked till I found him.",
"In a few days they went away, and we heard nothing but good news from them, till last winter.",
"God help him to understand it!",
"It moves away.",
"The view was not attractive on the score of beauty.",
"His father put on a dying look.",
"If so, it is well worth our while to examine it.",
"My answer is, that it was most probably just like the world in which we are living now, with the one exception that the plants and animals are different.",
"Everywhere the same, always the same, forever the same, there is no way out.",
"Besides, this is a strange world of choices.",
"These differences probably explain the emotional reactions of the face.",
"This waste is sometimes replaced by fat.",
"There are also numerous acquired forms.",
"Will he not then indeed become a god?",
"I was just waiting till somebody called me off.",
"So confused had he become with all this turning round and round that he could not be absolutely sure.",
"But there is a more natural way to a league than that.",
"Why, then, does the waste and killing go on?",
"The old state of affairs cannot continue.",
"We have still, of course, to feel the full shock effects even of this war.",
"Are men of light and purpose to have a voice in public affairs or not?",
"I have written of it so far as if it were just a joke.",
"Is it the boy with the beer?",
"Beauty is but skin deep.",
"Waste not, want not.",
"We never know the worth of water till the well is dry.",
"But I am informed that about this word there is no doubt.",
"But anyway, it was no joke, that was sure.",
"I always have the worst luck!",
"That he would lay his person at my feet!",
"Surely there must be something particularly interesting to him in the affair.",
"In a word, every thing had been concluded, and the wedding was daily expected to take place.",
"The reader will not suppose that the conversation continued much longer.",
"That ends my concern in the affair.",
"The children lay down upon the floor.",
"For any or all of these reasons, the town was delivered.",
"Trouble keeps, worse luck.",
"The girl lay there in the dark.",
"She knew more than one old face that was growing more attractive with each year of life.",
"But we got on together and kept house together till she married and went away.",
"God works with us when we work with him.",
"His choices rule all things.",
"We had a talk about personal beauty yesterday and one girl said she would rather have it than anything else in the world.",
"I never saw such a variety of beauty in one family.",
"When they met the girls the boys learned that they knew all about the affair.",
"They left the windows wide open, so that they might get all the fresh air possible.",
"God has put us where we are.",
"That thought stuck in his memory and would not out.",
"All the life of the town was drawn to a center about the hotel.",
"And when that hand moves, the gun is going to come out clean in it.",
"Special and extreme?",
"Then without warning he found her hand at rest in his.",
"God knew he did!",
"Did I not promise to do what I could?",
"Well, I am not one to forget my promise.",
"There will soon be nothing but fighting here from morning till night.",
"It is desire and love that save.",
"My desire is simply for information.",
"Moreover, they had met with no luck.",
"Peace must be concluded this evening.",
"It was no little affair.",
"They are easily to be felt when one comes into contact with a nation, though they may be hard to establish or define.",
"The objects, it is true, were different.",
"The reader will have his own opinion.",
"He wants to see and to hear, to examine and to work with his hands.",
"The windows are wide open at one end of the great room.",
"I mean for good luck.",
"Mothers both, I will.",
"No, no such block till now came in my way.",
"If they be friends, by promise we agree.",
"God speed, good fellow.",
"Go to the office, it shall be delivered.",
"So with that morning there began what was now to be their ordinary life together.",
"So he lay down again, but not to sleep, only to listen to his wife running about the room and trying to get out of it.",
"On this he ran out of the garden quickly till he came to the other side of the wall, but there was no hole there, so he concluded that she was not yet got through.",
"I made light of the whole affair, but I felt sure that this was only the beginning.",
"All the luck is outside the boat, they say.",
"Such a good joke it would have been!",
"There could be no god in the car without gold.",
"What, under the circumstances, was to be his individual line of conduct?",
"It may be of interest in the present circumstances to examine the causes and the course of this development.",
"During this stay both we and the dogs had nothing except dog meat to eat.",
"It seemed to us as if we had been transferred to a totally new country.",
"For the same reason, however, the task of interpretation is not easy or entirely safe.",
"That promise he carried out.",
"He is dying!",
"He lay quite still, looking straight in front of him.",
"What a joke!",
"His attitude was almost that of a host.",
"A couple of books lay on the table.",
"It is I who am manager of this affair.",
"His life was formal.",
"The insurance offices one and all shut up shop.",
"Their faces become the place.",
"A challenge was held forth upon the stage, and there was promise of a fight.",
"His name here may be a joke.",
"I promise him that is not my way.",
"The fish were dying, he said.",
"The bag can now be filled.",
"Dad showed us the different spots in and around the area he wanted us to cover and then left.",
"We showed my father the different spots we had visited, the places where trees were cut and the illegal houses.",
"Beyond this what have we acquired?",
"And is not the chief question at a trial the past conduct of the person at the bar?",
"This alone ought to influence us to an accurate discussion of this affair.",
"Meat they had none.",
"And yet I am extremely afraid of dying.",
"I never speak of her, and I desire never to hear of her more.",
"The air was indeed too heavy with beauty.",
"We lived there forever.",
"Something of weight lay upon his mind.",
"Indeed, the main building, which I have briefly described, had not been in use for many years.",
"Be that as it may, there is little difference in the treatment adopted by either school.",
"Many died for want of medicine.",
"This was meat and drink indeed to them.",
"They, at least, waste no time at the end.",
"She would promise anything.",
"How the door became shut, we have ever been at a loss to imagine.",
"Everywhere waste?",
"God only knows what use they are of just now.",
"He shut that door too.",
"When the age moves on, my story shall move on with it.",
"I must therefore examine the argument just stated.",
"God is on our side.",
"It ought to set people thinking seriously about their own attitude.",
"Her great desire was to live as long as I should, and I think she believed that this might happen.",
"I never trust him with any affairs of state.",
"Kill it, and we will put it into a bag and carry it to the doctor.",
"I felt not only a desire to be made willing to be sent, but also a desire to be prepared.",
"The women of the society held religious meetings by themselves twice a week.",
"The number of houses and streets quite confused them.",
"He told all save his love affair.",
"This interview, the reader will bear in mind, was before war had been declared.",
"Both parties tried to make political capital out of the affair.",
"Finally he broke a promise he had made to himself.",
"Waste of good time and paper!",
"I had all the luck.",
"The moment of shock had passed.",
"God, I can hear it now!",
"While he was speaking, we had time to examine him.",
"Another shock would kill him.",
"Moreover, he had nothing to talk about except bad times and bad luck.",
"Luck was dead against him.",
"Come in and drink till he comes.",
"The woman also carried a bag.",
"The speed of the car and the fan of the warm wind against their faces made conversation difficult.",
"The thought confused her.",
"Slowly he seemed to be raising and moving forward.",
"God, he was weak!",
"She had no desire to seek her room.",
"A dream, a daily dying!",
"No doubt there is a touch of the conventional in these.",
"Light of all beauty!",
"God gives while men sleep.",
"There is no one to bring me meat!",
"I shut my eyes.",
"Few of them certainly have had so much to waste.",
"At the time, however, at which I have now arrived, this state of affairs had entirely changed.",
"He was dying, perhaps, in her service.",
"And he had lost her forever!",
"Had he left her forever, forever, forever?",
"Just here she showed the beauty of her character.",
"So when they had made ready they sat down to meat.",
"God is love!",
"The shops were being shut.",
"The latter course was adopted.",
"We have just stated.",
"They were transferred from one box to another.",
"He had taken no part in our meetings.",
"Nearly all the shops were shut, thus making the street very dark.",
"An official report must also be drawn up.",
"I had none of the documents with me which we had just drawn up.",
"How was the letter to be delivered?",
"All the shops were being shut.",
"The blood is drawn.",
"I went in first, he followed me, and shut the door behind me.",
"They did not send him away till the next day.",
"They were delivered up to it.",
"The adults may have land, if they desire it, or they may go where they please.",
"It remains for the reader to say if the effort has been a success.",
"The women took great interest in public affairs at this time.",
"Conduct us to him.",
"Let us, then, in conclusion briefly consider the nature of that power.",
"He shut his eyes, and tried to place himself in his position of a month before, and failed.",
"Here comes another phase of description in this brief account of affairs of the man who fell in love.",
"He was thinking of it all, as he lay late in bed this summer morning.",
"There had been a promise in the way.",
"Delivered with such strength upon such a spot there could be but one result.",
"She was dying.",
"I could have taught him a good deal, I have no doubt, had I allowed myself to be drawn.",
"The course I adopted in practice was this.",
"It was the first room I visited in the morning and the last I went to every night.",
"He tried to rise, then fell forward again, and lay at length.",
"But, believe me, I would not let him go without a promise.",
"Let a man live now in the light of the knowledge that he is to live forever.",
"Rest depends upon conduct.",
"It was scheduled to remain one more day.",
"Just lay down.",
"Will he take the affair into his own hands?",
"And the affair of yesterday was one of them?",
"And there was no reason why she should take the affair more seriously than did the principal person concerned in it.",
"And has not the attitude of children toward going to school changed even more?",
"He told me he was free, and I employed him as such.",
"I shall leave it to the reader to imagine the meeting between myself and my family.",
"Beyond, closer to town, he could see other forms, small dark moving spots.",
"No hotels open in winter, as the village is covered with snow.",
"This was none of his affair.",
"He finished with a warning.",
"In it, such as it was, lay a hope.",
"He had not realized how attractive she was.",
"Not till they had finished did he make any comment.",
"But they had stuck to their guns like soldiers.",
"Taking these subjects in detail, it will be of interest to examine the progress made during the year.",
"The system may be described briefly as follows.",
"It will possibly be of further interest if mention is made of some of the points to which attention was drawn.",
"A door opened and shut.",
"It would be impossible to do the thing I had made up my mind to do, till after dark.",
"Their manner is free and easy, their attitude familiar.",
"God help me!",
"He was not the only one with a like mental attitude.",
"A like evolution has come about in medicine.",
"Well, maybe one exception.",
"This is true of objects that never were seen by the eye, that never could be seen.",
"Here another warning may be placed.",
"My situation, as I have before stated, leaves me no choice.",
"I ought to have taken the warning.",
"No man can give a just representation of another who is not capable of putting himself into the character of his original, and of thinking with his power and intelligence.",
"I am, and I desire to be, nothing.",
"They are allowed to hold their meetings.",
"I am a god!",
"He believed himself a god.",
"Which is the oldest?",
"And if any one would know how to study the natural history of any given spot as the history of the causes which have made it what it is, and filled it with the natural objects which it holds.",
"He made this joke almost every night.",
"His hair stuck up at the back.",
"Rather, she looked out on something in which she had never shared, could not by any chance imagine herself sharing.",
"The south windows were open.",
"She had probably never in her life had the least desire to see any of these places.",
"But eventually they were back again before that new black bag.",
"I give my readers warning, therefore, not to believe me.",
"We were all the afternoon employed in this sad work, and it was not until late in the evening that his father and mother came down to view the body for the first time.",
"God only knows what they were.",
"Both women and children, as well as men, were employed in these works.",
"Her mother had died a few months before, and then her husband had followed, dying suddenly and away from home.",
"Men, girls and boys are employed.",
"If this were ordinary service, I could not think of it.",
"If he was gay, it was barely possible for his wife and child to be sad.",
"Did she place it before my eyes as a warning to me?",
"She became very much interested in the people whom her father told about, and when she grew up she visited many of the places that he had told her about when she was a child.",
"As long as his mother lay there he could not be made to leave her, and when she was carried out, then he sat down in the spot where she always had sat, and did not go away the whole day.",
"Something soft and cold lay on his head.",
"Examine the facts.",
"Yet it confused me.",
"She has some medicine which she always takes.",
"My medicine is almost finished.",
"That medicine the doctor gave me helped me right away.",
"There was no sign of life or light from the dark windows.",
"But this morning he was just like an ordinary man.",
"That, to a certain extent, may be her own affair.",
"It was taken from the box, but in quite an ordinary, simple way.",
"But the shock will be all the worse when it comes.",
"The visit would almost certainly end in a formal call upon the family.",
"We do not comment upon her attitude.",
"I went into her room when she was taking some medicine in a glass and I asked her what it was.",
"Just now she could see nothing but the face, for the greatest shock was there.",
"And really, nothing seems to help me like my own particular medicine.",
"It seemed easy enough to promise.",
"But she shut herself inside the door.",
"This is some medicine the doctor gave me himself.",
"And the medicine is nothing that will hurt.",
"This attitude was shared by the entire office force.",
"He was dying to try it.",
"Had she or had she not any ordinary sense remaining?",
"She looked out of the back windows.",
"I remember wondering why he carried his bag about with him.",
"For a good hour one brain gave out, and the other took in, and without waste of words.",
"Not that there was anything out of the ordinary to watch.",
"It has not been through lack of desire to lay the record before the public.",
"I cannot believe, therefore, that I was wrong in my conclusion as to his attitude.",
"He followed the same course in the matter of foreign affairs.",
"Nor were the hotels open.",
"One more shot and the bear lay quiet.",
"I walked toward it to make it get up, but it would not, and still lay there.",
"To this there is hardly an exception.",
"We visited this country in the season of flowers.",
"Such things are not to be acquired in a week, but all that could be done in a week should be done.",
"Everywhere among the human faces were to be seen the heads of the dogs.",
"He lay as far as it was possible from the box, with his feet towards it and his head away.",
"For here indeed was a very different figure from what, in my first shock of surprise, I had expected to see.",
"I think probably the reader would like one, too.",
"Perhaps the reader knows what it meant.",
"The faces of the dead man and of the living boy were the faces of father and son.",
"Probably he had not presented so attractive an appearance before in many years.",
"There was a clear space before him, though, and he made good progress through it till he came again to the fall.",
"The can was not within reach of him as he lay.",
"The shock was too recent.",
"It was upon the side of a rising ground.",
"Are we not to believe a man, when he says he has a great desire to see another?",
"I doubt not, however, but he employed his time in private to very good purpose.",
"I gave great attention to it from first to last, and have drawn up a particular account of it.",
"Presumably there had always been an excellent understanding between them.",
"Of course the house was shut in far too closely by the trees at the back and sides.",
"God gives it to her.",
"They are easily modified in their growth.",
"This effect is so well known that it is often employed to prevent sleep.",
"The waste occurs in no one part alone, but in all the tissues.",
"Examine them.",
"These products may represent simple waste matter to be cast out or material which may be of use to some other tissue.",
"It seems hardly necessary to say that due attention must be paid to the source from which the introduced air is drawn.",
"The taste for certain articles is certainly acquired.",
"Lay on different parts of the skin a small, square piece of paper with a small central hole in it.",
"Students should be taught to examine their own bodies for this purpose.",
"There she lay in her beauty.",
"He was a good reader of human nature.",
"We must each bear our part in the beauty of the whole.",
"It was a good joke, he thought.",
"Well, there I lay.",
"So I lay.",
"Will the reader join us?",
"Like every other woman, she had had an affair of the heart.",
"It brings good luck to those who live with it.",
"There are no such faces now.",
"Party employed as before.",
"Party at camp employed as before.",
"She will be an example, as well as a warning.",
"I hear not the door shut again.",
"The door is again shut.",
"I have shut myself up from him.",
"He sent to desire an interview with me.",
"God rest her soul!",
"So he lay down in the leaves.",
"He lay still, watching her from his dark corner.",
"It was so perfectly beautiful, that face, that he wanted to shut his eyes against it.",
"Then the windows were washed.",
"Only that had seemed impossible, and something he must surely wait till he was grown up to do.",
"Then, too, he managed to get a little time to himself every morning, by rising very early.",
"The other end was not so often visited.",
"Soft, let me feel my bag.",
"Lay hold on these!",
"And if they do, worse luck.",
"As if his life or death lay in my hands?",
"Yet it is none of my affair whatever.",
"I only hope they may have half my good luck.",
"God has worked in my laboratory, and I was not there to see!",
"Why waste the time with many words!",
"She was with child, and when her time was come to be delivered, she brought forth a son.",
"The luck went this way and that.",
"Fight he must, and fight he would, for the army might never rise up till he was taken.",
"None made any comment on the state of affairs.",
"But I had bad luck.",
"And bad luck!",
"This door was shut.",
"And so forth, and so forth, till he is quite cross.",
"It will be a very good warning for him to begin with, before he goes to school.",
"He explained his strange conduct.",
"I knew him, for those who had kept him under watch had informed me of him.",
"Wait till I have finished.",
"They could not have drawn up a more perfect one themselves, and they did not love most of those whose names were found upon it.",
"That seems to show that he visited that house at some time.",
"He had intended to have one drawn up, but had put it off until it was too late.",
"I concluded that it was all of these.",
"This is no chance affair.",
"The use appears when the knowledge has been acquired.",
"We know him through the desire which like feels for like.",
"What will promote this?",
"He did not take much interest in that knowledge which was applied merely to rising in the world.",
"Nor is there a severe beauty of form.",
"Nor is it easy to find any modern author who has treated great questions in so attractive a way.",
"The whole affair was widely known.",
"Their number increased slowly till the conclusion.",
"The subject briefly explained.",
"Diet of mothers.",
"Appeal to mothers.",
"None of these should be used, except as medicine.",
"Mothers must see to this themselves.",
"Everything left to mothers.",
"Windows open during the night.",
"Let her avoid medicine, however, if possible.",
"But such mothers must have strange ideas of the animal economy.",
"He had with him many books, but rarely employed them.",
"But before he shut his heavy door, he walked through his rooms to see that all was right.",
"Much they saw, and far they went, and many homes they visited, but always with a happy end.",
"In most of these stories one person plays a joke on another.",
"They are noted for their beauty and strength.",
"Every case submitted to these courts was tried by a judge and jury.",
"The columns stand within the walls.",
"It was the rule to have twice as many columns along the sides as in front.",
"The machine was sure to break up at the first great shock.",
"We see it so in the management of all affairs.",
"A beauty, perhaps, not much observed.",
"Many days passed in these love interviews.",
"Then, having put on the dress of a woman, I began to search and examine all around me.",
"Now this promise had not really taken either of these children by surprise.",
"They all heard her, and looked at one another, trouble and wonder in their faces.",
"I am sure I do not desire it.",
"We never found a week in the year, nor an hour of day or night, which had not, in the open air, its own special beauty.",
"It was doing or dying, with him.",
"I see it in all faces.",
"There was, however, one exception.",
"I have not written thus, good reader, in these opening pages, to find a starting place for the record that is to follow.",
"I will give it to the reader.",
"I saw that he did not recognize me, and concluded not to make myself known until the surprise could be made more complete.",
"But something must be done, so I concluded to lead off.",
"The meetings were held, of course, in the former.",
"His house was immediately opened for religious meetings.",
"Only once was there an exception.",
"We also organized meetings outside of the village.",
"I informed him that I was there several years.",
"Of course no one can define it.",
"To this rule there will be no exception.",
"Rare luck for us!",
"God help him!",
"How much more, had he known all that lay behind!",
"She lay within his arms.",
"Every moment they are rising higher.",
"Yes, something moves.",
"At this the women lay hold of him, and dance round him.",
"Her whole soul went out to him as she lay within his arms.",
"I desire no portion with her.",
"The family is dying out.",
"Then she lay for a long time quite still.",
"To leave her thus forever!",
"That is my affair.",
"This must be no formal union.",
"Neither of them moves.",
"He moves toward the door.",
"They are shut up together.",
"So we stopped there a little while, and could have spent days there with interest and profit.",
"They too, till then, were friends.",
"Since that time, how completely had affairs changed!",
"He set his house in order like a dying man.",
"There was no exception to this rule.",
"They shall be stated.",
"It is really necessary to explain that this is not a bad joke.",
"There are deep moves upon the board.",
"They have given her that promise.",
"That was the promise.",
"The true floor, therefore, does not begin till near what appears from the outside to be the top of the building.",
"Desire her to walk in.",
"But her adopted son did not long remain with her.",
"No one ever claimed the child, and after a reasonable time they adopted her.",
"It was a very slow affair.",
"What talk there was about that affair!",
"When at last he saw what he was dying to see, what did he say?",
"What had he done to be visited thus?",
"She whom I have loved for half a life lies dying.",
"He thought that what she needed was rest, and she was to go to bed and take his medicine.",
"She had become a joke.",
"The old fellow repeated the warning again that night.",
"It was unknown in the literature of medicine.",
"Here now and then he was visited, it may be supposed, by old friends.",
"But this view, attractive as it is, can perhaps hardly be maintained.",
"God knows I do!",
"I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.",
"Come, see the place where he lay.",
"I am not a god.",
"Before he died he told me that he had observed no difference in the rising of the sun since when he was a little boy.",
"At the end of an hour he was out of bed, and into his medicine case.",
"We have left the principal things till we go back.",
"There were also other pictures which I had not time to examine.",
"It was a warning that the time had not come.",
"Those things are their own affair, and they ought to be shut up in a dark room to have it out together.",
"He looked back and saw the figure again, at the same place and in the same attitude as when he had first observed it.",
"I trust none present here think me capable of sharing in it!",
"This business concluded, he started to go.",
"It would never do to let them think that their joke has been a good one.",
"Now, do take warning by me.",
"It is wonderful, before I shut this up, how that child remains ever interesting to me.",
"But the work goes well, which is the great affair.",
"When, at the same time, I was not allowed to read, it passed a joke.",
"God knows where I am driving to.",
"Here I shut up.",
"I am rather taken with the idea of continuing the work.",
"God go with us!",
"But no such luck!",
"To wish, desire, love.",
"Now their separate characters are briefly these.",
"There is no old age where there is still that promise.",
"Will a man lay down his life for his friend?",

["In a minute it stood up.",
"At times, he stopped to investigate.",
"I have begun, in these later days, to take a growing interest in that great and ancient book.",
"Only the eyes were bright.",
"A long while, I stood, turned from the window.",
"Suddenly, the earth appeared to shoot forward.",
"In a while, my thoughts turned to other things.",
"I must have stood there some minutes.",
"After tea, I went, again, to have a look at the dog.",
"His thoughts seemed to have gone out of him into a great distance.",
"I stood perfectly straight and quiet, waiting.",
"Very few men took tea.",
"I think they made a mistake, both for themselves and their governments.",
"She was a great help to us, as she knew all the children, their ages, and what they would like.",
"Religion has changed in spirit as well as in form.",
"This spirit is changing.",
"His control is over the spirit of man.",
"So with every tool of trade.",
"Much of the ancient wealth and beauty shall be done away.",
"Watch any group of men talking, as the minister comes in.",
"But to understand business on this plane, and to conduct it in this large way, needs a fine education, an education built, first of all, on a practical basis, such as the education of our common schools.",
"We trade thoughts and feelings.",
"This is a false assumption.",
"But this short interview had changed the whole current of my thoughts.",
"Religion was a subject on which I had never heard her speak a word.",
"This convinced me that she walked in her sleep.",
"Further search for log.",
"He seemed to read my thoughts, and went on.",
"He began to laugh, quite to himself.",
"Once he got to the point of practical experiment.",
"He went up, as he supposed, till he was out of the reach of the bear, and held on, all the time keeping his eye on the animal, and making as little noise as possible.",
"It was a matter of small practical importance, what they were.",
"Yet the spirit of the opening day called to action.",
"I am agent for half a dozen companies.",
"But he had something practical.",
"The noise?",
"Let them laugh.",
"She took it carefully in her hand, wondering whatever it could be, but when she looked in it the terrible truth was clear.",
"But he was devoted to his boy in a quiet way.",
"He stood up and looked out of the window.",
"She admitted to herself he was right.",
"There was a ring.",
"She refused the kind offer.",
"More tea?",
"She stood up again and looked out of the window.",
"Had they accepted her offer or refused it?",
"She looked him over, carefully.",
"I know these people put bad medicine in my path.",
"I could not study to be a minister.",
"She had a little bit saved up.",
"He proved to be a very good teacher.",
"I cannot walk now and I must be careful of my health.",
"The lake lay to the north with no land beyond, the city to the east.",
"He can hardly have expected to find a customer in the crowd.",
"He set another log in place.",
"It was several moments before he spoke again.",
"He told them that they might kill him, but he should certainly not be driven away.",
"Without raising his head, he reached up to stroke her arm.",
"Look at her face, little lady.",
"Only a few of the general public knew exactly what the row had been.",
"There was a laugh.",
"He walked quickly out of the room, and came back a few moments later at a run.",
"Their numbers are always greater than those from any other country and the home grounds influence is strong.",
"Well, we had a game at the training grounds.",
"It started well and kept going faster until there was no longer need for speed.",
"To drop from this window, which is the only one large enough to admit of an adult body passing through, would mean pretty certain death.",
"Such, indeed, proved to be the case.",
"I brought a large number of letters, which proved welcome reading matter.",
"This proved to be a big hit.",
"He called to them several times to make less noise, but they paid little or no attention to him.",
"This, at least, is reliable.",
"But it cannot be called a practical joke.",
"It will be lucky if it is nothing worse.",
"Wealth is a wonderful opportunity.",
"She found the old lady alone.",
"She had seen the words in print often but they seemed different now.",
"And so it proved.",
"But then, there was the ring!",
"But neither moved for several moments.",
"All this had been going on up here for ages.",
"The little yellow face was very serious.",
"He stood looking down into the fire.",
"They stood still a moment before opening the front door.",
"And I saved his.",
"He stood quite still, offering it with fair words.",
"There was a noise about the door.",
"Course they got a row.",
"They stood and looked.",
"There they stood, not even covered.",
"Tax begun it.",
"Now comes the time to laugh at me!",
"So laugh, I say!",
"He did not ring.",
"Then he began to laugh.",
"She began to laugh.",
"If this is true of the interests of the professional artist, much more must it be true of the art training of the child.",
"The child then who is making, especially making for use, is to a certain extent developing himself as an artist.",
"It is difficult to see the good underlying this phase, but it was there.",
"How then can this play spirit be maintained side by side with work?",
"He had been through this pass before, and proved reliable and useful.",
"Here stood an officer with an open book in his hand.",
"Then at it they went, all around the ring.",
"With a quick movement of the head he dropped it inside his shirt.",
"His eyes showed no recognition.",
"I was only half convinced.",
"I do not think I had ever had much hope, but now I was convinced that all was over.",
"I changed my tone.",
"As a matter of fact, her thoughts had been so far away that she actually had not heard what he said.",
"She was more careful next time, and chose one who had the look of much experience and knowledge of the place.",
"And she had not even begun to think what she should do.",
"She said it was a real lady.",
"I have never heard of any old lady.",
"She was a pretty old lady, with white hair and dark eyes.",
"I know she is not a lady who would tell.",
"Her little presence had been always bright.",
"But this was different from her thoughts.",
"The lady looked at her for a little without saying anything.",
"She stood by him a little, and saw how he worked and would take something from one book and something from another, putting them ready for use.",
"He came straight through the crowd to where this lady stood, and said something to her.",
"They told her that the earth though so small was the place in all the world to which the thoughts of those above were turned.",
"She did not know that they were said to her, nor who said them, but accepted them as if they had come from her own thoughts.",
"But here was one who proved that it was not so.",
"This was the first impression made upon me.",
"The noise made my head ring.",
"It was beyond the range of my thoughts.",
"But the impression was strong and above reason.",
"This fall saved me.",
"Here he stood still for a moment, turning upon me, and took me by the hands.",
"He stood still for a moment and turned and looked at me.",
"I lay like a log upon the ground.",
"What did it matter which path I took?",
"We had come to the corner where the path turns.",
"After a while I stood still to see, or rather feel, where we were.",
"Does he investigate matters?",
"May he careful be and come back to me!",
"May he careful be, and come back to me!",
"What lady plays there?",
"They stood face to face.",
"He stood quite still.",
"Yet he stood where he was, smoking still.",
"Seeing what she saw now, she stood still in surprise.",
"However there was a bright side to it this time.",
"But neither can be proved.",
"Also we shall print our own names, in that case giving credit to whom credit is due.",
"In a few moments he opened the door and joined her.",
"He gave every woman the impression that his mind was lost wondering how he should exist until she gave him the right to call her his own.",
"I say shoot them.",
"She had driven him to his death.",
"Her letter sounds like a chapter from my own thinking of a dozen years ago.",
"Artist and model fell in love.",
"So I stood, though I thought my heart was broken.",
"See, I have kept it bright, for I loved him.",
"What a ring in his voice as he said it!",
"Split profits.",
"But the others were not yet ready to laugh.",
"This brought a laugh.",
"He stood looking about him.",
"He was so simple about it that she began to laugh.",
"He has refused it.",
"He stood there looking vast against the night.",
"The crowd split before him, for they had heard his name.",
"Her thoughts played back and forth in her eyes.",
"He stood up.",
"Not through that log wall.",
"Her tone at the door of the post office was ice.",
"They might have been caused in half a dozen ways.",
"I could see that, like myself, he was convinced that the girl was telling the truth.",
"Listen to the noise.",
"The old man looked carefully away from her.",
"Go careful.",
"A chief stood in the door.",
"At last he proved what it was.",
"He got food and clothing for them.",
"After that she was more careful.",
"Sometimes they get them by finding red or yellow earth.",
"He now had red, yellow, and blue.",
"But they were driven back.",
"They held their guns so they could shoot quickly.",
"They did not shoot.",
"All this they had done without any noise.",
"They are very careful to please this god.",
"Faster and faster she went.",
"They did not laugh any more.",
"He knew how to print.",
"That was to tell him to shoot quickly.",
"People had begun to think that they had all died.",
"He left the others, and went to shoot something to eat.",
"Or one as nearly as may be comprehensive?",
"These words should be studied carefully.",
"Let this be admitted.",
"He followed the girls from the lake and stopped for some time.",
"By and by, however, the point stood out close ahead.",
"Moreover, if the girl meant to help, she had some grounds for doing so.",
"He had begun to see a light and wanted to finish and get away.",
"Then I had begun to feel nobody at home wanted me.",
"He had begun to find out one could not do that kind of thing.",
"He would give them a few moments for thought before he finished his argument.",
"She could not hear all he said, because of the noise, and thought he did not hear her, but she did not mind.",
"Next morning they admitted that he was slowly making progress.",
"Yet sometimes even in a dark day I have thought them as bright as I ever saw them.",
"How pure it was!",
"I knew how to bind it.",
"It was the fresh interest in the attempt that gave birth to that wonderful architecture.",
"I looked at the size and form of it, which agreed perfectly with the fragment I had found.",
"Her character was in perfect keeping with the high tone of her books.",
"We stood still to listen.",
"One stroke.",
"But how to get rid of him?",
"There was a general soft laugh.",
"It is only fair to say that there are a great many people in the world that laugh at such things.",
"Replace on the field of work those who are on the field of battle.",
"Among the women actually employed, I have found without exception a fine spirit of service.",
"The first I noticed was in the window of a print shop, the owner a woman.",
"The fair grounds are reached.",
"The assumption cannot stand up under the facts.",
"Through careful saving, funds will be made available for the things of the spirit.",
"Carefully he measured the distance with his eye.",
"Very slowly it went at first, then faster and faster.",
"For some moments the men continued to argue.",
"And this proved to be the case.",
"The house stood a long way back from the road in its own grounds.",
"He had then turned his attention to the garden and the grounds surrounding the house.",
"She opened the street door before the lady of the house could ring.",
"He would want to be alone with his own thoughts.",
"Look at the other end of the first row.",
"In a low tone she said she had identified the body as that of her father.",
"But he was careful.",
"There were about a dozen newspaper reporters during the day at various times.",
"It soon became apparent that his evidence was making a deep impression on the court.",
"But I did not know how bad his thoughts were.",
"I stood there listening in case they started to fight, and I might be wanted.",
"I should see that ring again.",
"And thus it proved.",
"That may already have saved her.",
"The question he now asked proved it.",
"I had deeply loved my mother.",
"But I would not be driven.",
"Only be careful.",
"He followed them as they filed away into the kitchen, and, waiting till the men had gone about their work, turned his attention to the girls who stood about very much as if they did not know just what to do with themselves.",
"There was something in her tone which made him stop and look back.",
"Then he looked carefully about him.",
"The rest I left on the ring.",
"I might read the papers, but they had been carefully kept from me.",
"The episode of the ring confused me.",
"I held no ring, and dropped none in.",
"I know nothing about the ring.",
"But she stood in no need of his help.",
"She stood between me and the door, and her presence was terrible.",
"From the expression of such faces of the jury as I could see, I think he had proved it.",
"Of this I was convinced, difficult as it made my future.",
"It was his spirit.",
"The last time he would have shot him if the girl had not saved him.",
"Not much of his life had been spent at the posts.",
"Every muscle in his body stood still.",
"They had stood side by side.",
"She takes care to count them before serving him with them.",
"His father refused.",
"He refused.",
"Soon they entered a village and offered the ring to the governor, who asked them for another like it.",
"The little wife read his thoughts.",
"Their path.",
"This was the first ring and the first stone.",
"This has been the case in all ages, and still remains so.",
"He was an old man when he was called to lead the country, but he brought with him all his fighting spirit.",
"It can even take away wealth from some and give it to others, but cannot create the wealth.",
"The idea was good, but hardly practical.",
"In a few minutes he had opened the street door and admitted him.",
"I stood long looking out at it and wondering what my life here had in store.",
"We washed the blood from the faces of the women and stood for a long time looking down at them.",
"There was a tone in her voice which I had never heard before.",
"If I turn not every moment to account, I shall never be prime minister again.",
"No one was ever admitted to his laboratory.",
"It is the real spirit.",
"It was a hot bright afternoon.",
"But my thoughts are busy.",
"The second stage of the war had then begun.",
"He had at this time seen very little of the only relative whom he over deeply loved.",
"He did not mind the noise now since he was helping to make it.",
"That he was really devoted to her, I knew.",
"But make no noise.",
"He knew that I had driven there, and intended to follow me if I came forth.",
"The period is therefore worth careful study.",
"Religion seemed dying there, and love of country dead.",
"Of painting speech and speaking to the eyes?",
"For the first, thus it stood.",
"Strange, practical man!",
"The laugh did them good.",
"And the country counts for something, too.",
"Now there were half a dozen, all broad and with a fine surface, capable of taking any traffic.",
"Between them was passing something which I did not understand.",
"They had entered the room, and stood in a group before my father.",
"A dozen of them set upon the coach.",
"He might have done so half a dozen times.",
"She looked up at him then, and her eyes were very bright.",
"It would take more than a dozen men to lay hands on him.",
"Clean as the driven snow!",
"Of course, both men were convinced that murder had been done.",
"He was either deeply moved, or proved himself an excellent actor.",
"He was convinced.",
"Sometimes, once or twice in a week, that lady visited the upper regions in which the child lived.",
"The other boys would laugh at him.",
"He loved the boy very deeply.",
"This state of things is to some extent passing away.",
"This was quite in the spirit of the ancient times.",
"The soldiers caught the full spirit of their leader.",
"So it has been in all ages, and so it will be for ever.",
"It shall be saved.",
"This it was to be a lady, in the old days when too many men had little care save to make war.",
"And this it is to be a lady still, in the new days in which too many men have little care save to make money.",
"This stood outside the city to the east.",
"But apart from its architecture the church is full of interest.",
"She went every day for a week, and stood in the same place.",
"But I hardly noticed her until she dropped a letter from her clothing.",
"Sometimes there is never another stroke.",
"They did not speak again for some moments.",
"Everything here was fresh and new, but selected with excellent taste and careful attention to detail.",
"He laugh.",
"But the others stood their ground.",
"He turned red and refused to meet her eyes.",
"Talk with some minister.",
"From what I can learn, he has saved nothing.",
"The order of our thoughts should be the order of our writing.",
"How weak is painting to describe a man!",
"They are divided into classes, each class being watched over by some lady of the committee.",
"The words stood well apart.",
"And that someone had had a different impression of her.",
"The actors had not yet made their appearance.",
"He was wondering in which specific direction to go when he heard a noise in the trees.",
"At first she felt afraid passing by.",
"The months with which it opened proved nearly as trying as the worst of winter.",
"The lake itself is very low.",
"The demand was refused.",
"His education and training was carefully directed by his mother.",
"The first appearance in print!",
"There was no one more careful of the character of those with whom she had to do.",
"By this day, she is a fair lady.",
"Has he lost his wealth at sea?",
"What is to be said to him, lady?",
"It proved to be a very large library.",
"Something bright in all!",
"But they did not speak, as if each were deep in his own thoughts.",
"In this he had taken no active part, but he had given largely of his great wealth.",
"Each thought more of the next stroke than of the present party.",
"He gave a little laugh.",
"He did not speak for some moments.",
"She gave a short laugh as she followed him.",
"It was a little too bright, perhaps.",
"He closed the door carefully behind him.",
"Suddenly she gave a little laugh.",
"During those few moments she suddenly came face to face with her position.",
"That I am convinced of.",
"They stood side by side.",
"She stood there looking out, and every one in the room was watching.",
"The snow had begun again.",
"Some few men are so constructed.",
"She had plenty of spirit.",
"She was not careful.",
"She gave a little laugh.",
"There was a little laugh.",
"But the tea was never made.",
"The white shirt appeared here and there.",
"He stood looking out of the window for a few moments.",
"At great moments we are suddenly brought face to face with the limits of human nature.",
"Such moments as these turn our lives and determine them.",
"She turned suddenly again, and, coming back, stood looking into his face.",
"He saw where his wife stood, but he did not look at her.",
"We can shoot them down from the windows.",
"He moved away and stood for a moment with his back turned to her, looking toward the house.",
"My lady!",
"Thoughts, thoughts!",
"But all this makes small impression.",
"And he went off to serve a customer who had just entered.",
"Where were the boys and girls of even a dozen years ago?",
"How the minister was not so well as usual, and people were getting to be a little worried about him.",
"The minister spoke up just here.",
"Bind him!",
"And they were tired out, and how lucky it was they had found a place to camp, and company.",
"When the tea is warm, it is ready to serve.",
"No expectations of a personal character should influence them one way or the other.",
"Give strong coffee or tea.",
"I devoted myself more to my mother, and interested myself in the poor and sick.",
"But an age takes its tone from the many who are the children of the past, rather than from the few who are the parents of the future.",
"In short, it is hardly too much to say, that our thoughts are more dependent on our feelings than our feelings on our thoughts.",
"Must a good artist be a good man?",
"I can only remember seeing him once for a moment, but he made an unusual impression upon me.",
"A lady who saw her said it improved her appearance.",
"We decided to shoot him.",
"I almost got mine day before yesterday and feel pretty lucky to be here.",
"Often their efforts proved effective.",
"Even this was not definitely refused.",
"I turned to my work again, continuing to shoot slowly.",
"The spirit of the people is wonderful.",
"We cannot get rid of them.",
"I never heard such a row in all my life.",
"They were to be driven out if it took a month.",
"We are passing from one extreme to the other, in this, as in other things.",
"This lady never had a child.",
"Then it was that he began to notice for the first time what a noise the rats were making.",
"He thought he heard a noise as of someone at the door and looked up.",
"For a few moments there came upon him a sort of fear.",
"Love, however, had stood the test.",
"For a while I stood stock still and kept my eyes in one direction.",
"As they were on the up side of me I took the down path and began to run.",
"They cannot be driven from their position by a little paper shot.",
"Laugh and be well.",
"This, if anything, proved as clear a sign as possible to them.",
"It was lovely to have someone to laugh with.",
"They stood still to consider what was to be done.",
"He stood for a moment without speaking.",
"Saved, and by whom?",
"Of course, the weather was warm and the subject of clothing was not so serious as it might have been.",
"I saw that it was of little use to attempt further conversation for the present, and, still holding his hand and allowing him to direct me, looked round again at the scenes through which we were passing.",
"We have got rid of old age, and, to a great extent, of disease.",
"Or have I proved my arm a little too substantial?",
"Of course they cost nothing save the original purchase.",
"Why, he refused to wait for the draft!",
"High per cents.",
"Back in the ages!",
"The world was full of little men, but he refused to stay little.",
"A door stood wide open.",
"He had been lucky.",
"He understood that she would not even let him, for a moment, have a wrong impression of her.",
"So long as he could remember, this room was most closely associated with his actions and his thoughts.",
"Men were passing in and out.",
"We have one at whom the boys laugh.",
"Both miss the spirit of men.",
"I fear I shall laugh at death.",
"To laugh at death!",
"He showed the right kind of spirit.",
"The other is all yellow.",
"His life on earth, his spirit in the beyond, could never be now what they might have been.",
"She was one who loved only few, but these deeply.",
"Then he begun to have influence over them.",
"Then she felt him release himself so he stood free.",
"There is some great purpose running through the ages.",
"Then she pointed to the other end of the room, and there I saw a table with tea and coffee.",
"I admitted that I made efforts in that direction.",
"In almost every case the large star is yellow.",
"His influence then would have saved me, but he refused to even read my letter of explanation.",
"Yet I was convinced even this would not prove serious.",
"Whether, or not, I had made an impression on the fellow I did not know.",
"A resort to the latter is at present impossible.",
"He is a reliable man.",
"It proved a longer wait than I expected.",
"All of them were deeply interested.",
"When he finished there was no hole, but the great rock stood on level ground.",
"His wife he had newly married, and I had never yet seen her.",
"Well, it made me laugh to think about it.",
"They stood close together, right at the edge.",
"When he came up over the rock again, gone but a few moments, true to his word, she ran to meet him.",
"He stood by her and they looked out across the mountains.",
"She went to her window and stood looking out.",
"I am up in the mountains, at our log house.",
"She stood again looking at herself in her glass.",
"The afternoon was passing and the dark would come early.",
"He stood a moment looking at her.",
"His eyes did not laugh.",
"She went faster.",
"So she stood very still.",
"Or is the lady mine?",
"Thus they stood for a second only.",
"It was a chosen resort of mine.",
"They know she can hold up her end of a row as well as any one.",
"A man is built for work, like a truck.",
"She stood up and looked at him, with widely opened eyes.",
"She might be all right, but they said a church society must be careful.",
"The boy seemed to answer her thoughts.",
"The factor had said he would shoot him if he ever came for me.",
"Yet a few moments, and we shall be safe.",
"To shoot them?",
"His house and stable stood in the middle of a large field, and they were at some distance from the road.",
"The lady got up to take her leave.",
"After tea, he called us out in the garden again, and said he had something else to teach us.",
"Then she began to laugh at me.",
"There was enough left to put all thoughts of fighting out of their heads.",
"He was very careful about their food.",
"One evening, before tea, he did this.",
"It was all dark and still in the car, and nobody came in, but the noise kept up outside, and I knew something had gone wrong with the train.",
"I followed him and stood outside.",
"We had already driven there several times.",
"I ran down on the road and stood in front of them.",
"Father gave him to me, and the first time I saw him on his feet, I went up carefully and put my hand on him.",
"He had saved a little money that he kept in a box under his bed.",
"Then he passed through, and instead of going up to the house, turned around, and stood with his head toward the road.",
"Father has always stood up for him.",
"Her heart stood still.",
"And then all laugh.",
"The noise increases.",
"It is in the path again.",
"And I think we have that kind of freedom in these islands as perfectly as any men are likely to have it on this earth.",
"The religion of science has a future.",
"Also, at every age, the amount of blood passing through them is very large compared to their size.",
"Particularly are the reactions of the mixed sex types to be carefully considered.",
"The truly novel in the content of the idea is the recognition of the fact that the wish is charged.",
"As a matter of fact, common practice has recognized the fact, if not the mechanism and its significance, for ages.",
"He never counts the cost.",
"I expect to be careful from now on, and try to get choice subjects.",
"Inside, the house proved very attractive.",
"The state governments still see to that.",
"They have not begun to realize that peace also has its price.",
"But in practice this involves something else.",
"But be careful!",
"Let them laugh that win.",
"Who the lady of his love was, we do not know.",
"But that only made him laugh a lot.",
"Pretty soon I noticed him passing again and walking very slow.",
"So just for the fun of it I stood up and said.",
"The gold cross is very bright.",
"He thinks it may have gone down in the lake.",
"It was partly so he could see all around and be sure no one was coming.",
"All the time I had a funny feeling and I kept looking away from the fire and up the dark path to see if he was coming.",
"One thing I noticed and that was that some of the trees around there stood in the water.",
"I was right on the edge of that ring I made.",
"The lake is there.",
"And I went south toward the lake.",
"Pretty soon I came out where I could look down and see the lake all spread out before me.",
"Not one tool could she put her hands on.",
"But she might have saved her worry.",
"So it proved.",
"After dinner, the lady of the house, as usual, turned the conversation upon the subject of politics.",
"He was on a visit to a sister, who lived very near the spot upon which he now stood.",
"It was give and take, for a few moments.",
"This was partly true.",
"Be careful, old rats!",
"Not of the lady.",
"The words came harder than before, but at last he got rid of them.",
"Was it to take tea?",
"She has not even begun to do yet.",
"She always has something bright to say.",
"I refused it when he wanted to give it to me.",
"If she had not refused that something he had brought her this would not have been so hard.",
"But she was the lady that some other girls had not become, he argued.",
"He stood watching her.",
"The boys stood around for a quarter of an hour and then decided to walk up to the country road that had been mentioned.",
"The old lady continued to call after them, but they paid no attention.",
"He was thinking deeply.",
"In a few minutes the lady teacher came back.",
"Nor was the noise they had heard repeated.",
"What thoughts should we have about it?",
"There are many thoughts which we may have.",
"But having begun, they cannot end.",
"They like religion.",
"And all the while they keep up their religion.",
"Religion and politics were with them one and the same thing.",
"When they seemed sad they might be about to laugh.",
"There was a familiar ring in his voice.",
"The noise passed all description.",
"Yet he had small grounds for his hopes.",
"I can shoot straight.",
"Not very much faster.",
"Passing the love of woman?",
"Passing the love of woman!",
"It proved so.",
"He gave a quiet laugh.",
"As to that stroke alone, its hour and place and fashion, he remained without decision.",
"They went faster and faster.",
"Faster, faster, faster they went!",
"The music began to play and they went round, and round, and round, faster and faster.",
"He had never before shown himself more active, more devoted to business.",
"Figures that he had seen in print came back to his mind.",
"If I had been a few moments later it would have been all over.",
"Who could that lady be?",
"They all began to laugh.",
"Everybody began to laugh, but she failed to understand the reason.",
"Why did they all laugh at her in that fashion?",
"Let me be careful how I read, and, above all, how I read ancient history.",
"What we know something about is the general situation, and the action, in fact, taken at certain moments.",
"This reading and writing, what is it, after all, but the signs for things and thoughts?",
"It is more important that it should be kept pure than that it should become popular.",
"Shall not this hand reach to this heart the stroke?",
"Why, I say they cannot be saved.",
"No, by lady, no.",
"What shall I do to purchase company?",
"What lady?",
"More pounds, and we thus heavy?",
"Poor lady, is that the way for her husband to talk!",
"But they stood firm.",
"Very musical.",
"The story had to be all told over again, of course, and did good service in getting their thoughts in order for the trip before them.",
"They stood by him.",
"They stood right by him!",
"No minister, no general, was at his side.",
"Take the housing problem.",
"No man had ever yet seen it, no man had ever yet stood on it.",
"Nothing had changed since he had last stood there.",
"She gave a short laugh and stopped suddenly.",
"No, I will not go into religion.",
"She gave a laugh as she led the way.",
"He had apparently studied the subject somewhat carefully.",
"She went to the window and stood there looking out.",
"He knew the weak places and passed them carefully.",
"When he was at home his window stood open by night or day, winter or summer.",
"Let us be practical.",
"She stood there looking across to the mountains.",
"He stood with his face half turned away from her so that she could only see his profile.",
"He always keeps the path.",
"It does me good for the rest of the day when I meet any of their people in my path.",
"I partly believe, he made pretty sure of his company.",
"Great expectations were formed.",
"So, I carefully opened it.",
"Anything awful makes me laugh.",
"Upon this the old lady immediately became a principal actor in the scene.",
"But now we will listen to another tone.",
"They all stood perfectly still to look at us.",
"I managed to purchase the glass and also to get it cut to size.",
"She refused, saying that I should learn to do things on my own.",
"Just being in his company is one big laugh!",
"Of tea, what have I said?",
"The advantage of such a settlement, in time of peace, is, I think, not easily to be proved.",
"They left it, as it stood.",
"Not content with serving the poor for nothing, he paid them for being served.",
"We continued our discussion on a more practical subject.",
"The people, indeed, have but one religion.",
"I myself was for some years totally regardless of religion.",
"Always have something saved at the end of the year.",
"There is, I believe, no such fragment at all.",
"He never seems to study either for thoughts or words.",
"A moment she held it, then set it free, perhaps for its lack of spirit.",
"Had they been saved?",
"Their general tone had been negative.",
"The minister let her.",
"The minister was a man of years and weight and worth.",
"But I had convinced her.",
"There were moments in which I made no doubt of all this.",
"He will continue through the ages to be an impossible boy.",
"I stood at her side.",
"We were down from the stars at once, but I saw nothing to laugh at, and said as much.",
"But the thoughts of some were busy.",
"I knew him by his hand and ring.",
"She stood up and looked him straight in the face.",
"This, then, is the hope of those who pass over in recognition of the great truth.",
"But how about those who have passed over without that recognition?",
"Now what must this passing out of the body mean to us?",
"Here, indeed, in this campaign the black man has kept up the spirit of the white.",
"But we waste the moments.",
"That very day, therefore, he proposed, and was refused.",
"But the lady was extremely interesting at the moment.",
"That face and figure, and the spirit which spoke through them, entered his heart at once, never again to leave it.",
"But was it the right path?",
"I seem to have begun a new life.",
"Take up a false religion, and give up everything for it!",
"Lady fair!",
"I find their cause to be just and pure.",
"They are partly right.",
"Public feeling with him counts for nothing.",
"Do we treat her as our religion requires us?",
"This, I hold, is the law of our religion.",
"I hold strong views on religion and on marriage.",
"That probably is the most effective contribution of the scientific spirit of the age.",
"But religion is a matter of the heart.",
"It has begun already.",
"He says he made up his mind to shoot in a moment.",
"This lady lived longer than any other wife I had.",
"The grounds on which this place is conducted are different from most of the kind.",
"As I find myself again in this country, many thoughts of former days spring up in my mind.",
"He was informed they were saved through faith in the promise.",
"I must admit that I allowed my thoughts to travel in another direction.",
"The letters seemed to grow larger to him as he stood and read.",
"His evil moments for that afternoon were over.",
"But of one thing I am perfectly convinced, and that is that there is no man in the world who would be less likely to make away with himself.",
"Well, I refused anything.",
"The small boy proved fully equal to his mission.",
"He admitted the fact briefly.",
"She looked at him and it was obvious that she was more than half convinced.",
"He stood there, holding her hands.",
"We stood for a moment face to face.",
"Be careful, man.",
"Get out of my path.",
"She is face to face now with a decision, a decision to which she is partly committed.",
"I love the noise of it.",
"She stood quite still for several moments.",
"Then she stood up.",
"It seems bright enough here, and gay.",
"He had barely time to say good night before he heard the ring off.",
"The boys refused to touch it.",
"Each week a division of the profits was made.",
"And he saved my life, too.",
"She was like the log.",
"Still she ran on, with her eyes upon the log.",
"The private secretary looked up.",
"He followed him in and carefully closed the door.",
"The chairman looked at the secretary.",
"He admitted it tonight in my presence.",
"Go through them carefully.",
"Each was busy with thoughts of his own.",
"He stood and watched her.",
"It seemed ages.",
"Instead, she had proved herself, so far, a perfect lady.",
"The shirt had done the work!",
"She stood a moment.",
"But her thoughts she kept to herself.",
"But not with the spirit of earlier in the evening.",
"He was sorry, now, that he had not put on the white shirt.",
"The next day they washed the shirt.",
"Now laugh!",
"Tell me, bright boy!",
"It was as if I were the activity, and my hands and feet were only experiments for my spirit to work upon.",
"Sometimes I stood long moments without saying a word.",
"It was night when we reached the school grounds.",
"Then I lost my spirit.",
"Why for the first time now did religion interest him?",
"I looked upon the modern exactly as I did upon the ancient religion, as something which in no way concerned me.",
"Of the truth of this I was convinced, but to know that a feeling would make me happy if I had it, did not give me the feeling.",
"My original expectations of success were extremely limited.",
"Bright because he was out of town.",
"He asked the distance to the new house on the other side of the lake, and having been informed, spoke of the fishing.",
"It saved me.",
"He forced a laugh.",
"As she did so, something dropped from it into the lake.",
"I could almost laugh!",
"She stood and looked at him.",
"But for the next few days she did not leave her own grounds.",
"Though perhaps I ought not to say that of mine, for I count myself lucky in both husband and son.",
"She turned to him with a low laugh.",
"This man refused.",
"A boy was passing by.",
"I said to myself that on critical days such moments come, but do not return.",
"A group stood before the door.",
"There was a noise in the street.",
"Having saved him, he loved him.",
"This man in truth was passing before us.",
"A truck came up.",
"It is a crime to be passing by.",
"This shot saved us.",
"He did go to sleep, in fact, a few moments later.",
"Shoot us!",
"He was truly and deeply moved.",
"By and by, however, the child will make its first attempts to walk.",
"Errors in diet will sometimes alone have a similar effect.",
"Shoot me!",
"So long had he been from them, that they had lost their place in his thoughts.",
"To go to war with them would be sure to lose him and his friends these profits.",
"So doing he will purchase many friends.",
"He would have no talk of payment, as things stood.",
"He has the strength of a dozen men.",
"He said he would be practical.",
"There is no comprehensive excuse for him.",
"He had his tea, and went back to court.",
"If those songs proved successful I should have more.",
"The little home had begun to grow in beauty once more.",
"He stood for a little while thus looking and listening.",
"The first thing that we need to have religion do for us is to teach us to face the facts.",
"In what spirit and with what weapons are we to enter the great conflict against the evil that is in the world?",
"What we are to ask for is not simply the old way, but that one among the old ways which has been tested and tried and proved to be the good way.",
"The latter stood his ground, and there was a shock.",
"He wanted to know something of its practical side.",
"Be careful.",
"I say faster, faster, faster!",
"He proved his words when his turn came again.",
"I have seen a dozen of them in my time.",
"These children all enjoy coming to take tea with me.",
"There stood my little friend.",
"On bright days they ran to school hand in hand.",
"In a few moments she ran off to her play.",
"But she refused them all.",
"How those children will laugh when they are grown up!",
"The things of religion so often to the children tell themselves what they mean!",
"And the minister!",
"The children had said nothing that the minister had not said.",
"Pretty soon my friend got up and walked away, saying he had got religion.",
"I have as many thoughts as another, but, for want of education, I lack the power to express them in speech or writing.",
"The lady looked at her.",
"His tone was a challenge.",
"Night had begun to fall as they returned to the city.",
"For some moments they continued to work over the machine without apparently being able to set it to rights.",
"My own thoughts.",
"What penalty might she not have to pay yet?",
"And there was no way of getting rid of it.",
"The music had begun.",
"The girl came back and stood before him.",
"The man stood there for a second, making up his mind to move on.",
"In a few moments she was back.",
"It would be long before she could forget how he had broken through the door and saved her.",
"Shoot him down.",
"He had to move carefully, not to give her an opportunity.",
"Wanted to get rid of him.",
"He was lucky to be alive.",
"But it would be a great deal in her thoughts.",
"He recognized the spirit in which it was given.",
"Beyond this was a second lake, a larger one.",
"The other was to make tea.",
"None the less his blood moved faster.",
"Straight for the big lake.",
"There were about a dozen in all.",
"When at last she did meet him, it was by pure chance.",
"One officer and one man were saved.",
"Divided control of the forces in that area was partly responsible for this.",
"And I refused to let him come here.",
"I stood still, and tried to think.",
"But each sentence went out of my head before I had begun the next.",
"That is, what shall we do to be saved?",
"He is what he is, regardless of what other men think of him.",
"Was it to build technical schools and provide a means for practical and useful education?",
"And so, for a while, they stood thus, she looking at his arm, and he at her.",
"I thought it was just that he refused to think for himself.",
"Only, why print them after they have had their day and served their turn?",
"Spirit of freedom!",
"But his mind was passing from him.",
"Go in and make him laugh.",
"I am lucky.",
"I have been caught and killed at least a dozen times!",
"To replace him is as difficult as to fit a new head to a body.",
"Neither is religion itself.",
"But, for practical purposes, we may define the natural history of the causes which have made it what it is, and filled it with the natural objects which it holds.",
"Of natural religion I shall say nothing.",
"The saying has proved true, at least, to me.",
"She set all before him and stood by him.",
"It was so bright and quiet.",
"Such was the battle of the islands.",
"This was the work of but a few minutes, and the women were placed in a row on one side of the room and the men on the other.",
"But we were off in a few moments.",
"At any rate he refused to let him go.",
"Her thoughts were not quite so quiet as her position would seem to indicate.",
"It made a deep impression on the children.",
"A soul whose wealth we have once recognized must be ever rich to us.",
"All day he stood before that window.",
"He saved himself by flight.",
"As quick as the thoughts of men.",
"It ought to have remained a fragment.",
"The tone and manner said more than the words.",
"He stood there without saying a word.",
"But she went into her room only after everything was bright and in its place.",
"But the mother did not laugh.",
"She always counts.",
"We are on the wrong side of the lake.",
"It is only when one looks back that one counts the miles.",
"There is a place on the lake, on this side.",
"But the doctor only walked the faster.",
"He was also prepared to shoot the dog.",
"She had refused him!",
"This, it felt, was something like a proper spirit.",
"It was the penalty for being late.",
"The ring is safe.",
"The days in which they had not met had been full of thoughts of him.",
"And if he had had any sense he might have been going to stay for tea.",
"I must be more careful.",
"She was very much hurt about the ring being sold.",
"A man was coming up the path.",
"There always is a difference between night and day thoughts.",
"Probably she would laugh a little.",
"If she should laugh it would answer the last doubt in his heart.",
"What a bright idea!",
"A glass of water stood ready.",
"The ring!",
"She could not remember exactly where she had put the ring.",
"She did not doubt that it contained the ring.",
"She knew who stood there.",
"She had been admitted to the bar.",
"Be careful that no reporters get hold of this.",
"No, pounds!",
"She had talked that morning of going for a drive, but rain had begun to fall, and she had stayed in.",
"Maybe he knew something, and was likely to split.",
"His lady secretary may be as right as he is, or as wrong as he is.",
"Now, listen carefully.",
"It is not necessary to look far for a sufficient and very practical reason.",
"Those regions were rich in natural resources and their economic future under a stable government was bright.",
"But at the time I was convinced that the right course was the one which I followed.",
"Attempts were made by both sides to reach some common ground for an agreement, but none was found.",
"This evening, just as we were having our tea, another bear made his appearance.",
"Unfortunately this bear fell in so much water that it was impossible to take any other accurate measurement than the one along his back.",
"Now for the first time I had a good view of the bear, which proved to be a very large one.",
"They were at no great distance, but it was rapidly growing dark, and there was not time to get within range while it would be light enough to shoot.",
"Finally, as a last resort, we determined upon a drive.",
"Bright days had been so rare with us that we meant to make the most of this one.",
"Our men had already proved themselves good.",
"As they went, they stopped every little while and stood for some time looking back.",
"Fresh signs, made that morning, were everywhere in evidence, and it had apparently been a favorite resort all summer.",
"No report can transfer to the mind of another an impression thus derived.",
"His path was stopped as he made for the ring.",
"I looked about for the log, but could not find it.",
"He would not have sent such a message without very good grounds.",
"If our way admitted of a choice of direction, we usually decided by the sound of the name of village or town.",
"Be careful to remember that.",
"If they can be saved, we shall save them.",
"But the child looked up in wonder, and the men who stood by did not know what it meant.",
"Indeed, I shall be very careful to put the matter in such a shape that she will not believe me.",
"The lawyer sat for a few moments as if lost in thought.",
"He started forward, but they were already passing out at the door.",
"The man turned his face toward the door, and stood for a minute without speaking.",
"The lady still stood, holding her child by the hand.",
"Then, a bright idea came to him.",
"No one seemed to know just how the jury stood.",
"Had he not saved the child from death?",
"With a large portion of the money he had thought to buy new clothing for himself.",
"In all the coming years there was not one bright spot to which he could look, this day, with hope.",
"The world had become bright and beautiful once more.",
"It took a long time to do this, but when it was completed he stood up on it to put the first stone in place.",
"He had not expected to find the lady and the lawyer there.",
"Then the lady spoke.",
"He stood out once more in the free and open air.",
"Use and importance of wealth.",
"Thoughts on drinking.",
"The minister not being at home, there was no service.",
"I was happy when tea came.",
"Then we had coffee and tea.",
"He did not laugh when he told this story.",
"He said, he would be more careful for the future.",
"I was lucky enough to hit it at once.",
"Do it in the morning, that we may laugh at him all day.",
"I am no friend to making religion appear too hard.",
"We went to tea.",
"I could not drink this day either coffee or tea after dinner.",
"They were still convinced that their advice was right.",
"His tone changed.",
"I called it a laugh.",
"I want to be alone for a few moments.",
"Her heart beat faster.",
"I hope they will have a dozen.",
"Every movement of a muscle, for instance, involves change in its component cells.",
"All work involves waste.",
"Hence the care of the eyes during school life is a matter of the most practical importance.",
"It only keeps in what should be got rid of.",
"Remove the clothing with the greatest care.",
"The introduction of fresh air into a room or building in such a manner as to keep the air within it in a pure condition.",
"Her feelings were deeply moved on both sides.",
"They know how to deal with the facts before them, to put things into a practical shape, and they value men only as they can forward the work.",
"He gave her back the papers, as she supposed, and she replaced them in the secretary.",
"Mother did laugh this time.",
"It was not to be refused.",
"Next year she lives for us only in her children, fair and pure as herself.",
"Another message was passing.",
"People may say it may be of practical use, or not.",
"Faster and faster!",
"Other doctors would have saved her.",
"It is a spirit.",
"We had come under some trees that made the road very dark, when the girl saw a bright light moving slowly across the road.",
"I was passing that way myself, and I got a drink of it.",
"The result proved we had adopted the right course.",
"Neither sex wear any clothing.",
"I have done nothing but talk of this lady ever since I saw her.",
"All my future attempts must be poor to this.",
"I want a comparison for this lady.",
"I refused him.",
"When she stood above him he shut his eyes, though he wanted very much to look up into her face.",
"They often laugh at us.",
"Now the room was musical with sound.",
"All the little bright eyes of animals watched her.",
"When they were quite near they stood to watch.",
"He stood to watch.",
"The entire spirit of his thoughts was changed.",
"The boat was harder than ever to row.",
"This argument proved effective.",
"Perhaps they walked faster than usual.",
"Her heart began to beat faster than ever.",
"The way she looked just proved it.",
"What did happen was that he began to walk, not very fast, but still passing along as if he were moving rapidly.",
"She put some leaves around it to make it look nice, and it noticed there were a great many other things on the table, and they all looked fresh and bright.",
"It is not fear, but wonder, bars my speech.",
"What a noise is there?",
"Come, lady, let us in.",
"The lady and her son did not.",
"Yet go to, laugh on!",
"He was saved.",
"I refused.",
"This put other thoughts in my head.",
"They went so far at last as to offer to provide a lady for him.",
"Their home and region is the air, but this warm world is their resort.",
"There was no lady so fair in all the land.",
"Passing heavy was the lady in her thought.",
"One knew that they were interested despite their careful lack of all expression.",
"Old lady, indeed!",
"When he put it on, however, it proved a poor fit.",
"He went carefully.",
"Handle it carefully.",
"At least all the windows were bright with light.",
"But why should the lady have such a sad picture as that in her room?",
"I am sure I shall split.",
"But the strange lady put it aside.",
"But please use it carefully.",
"He gave a short laugh.",
"What was there about this strange girl that had made so deep an impression on me?",
"Quite a reliable man.",
"As soon as I had read that document I felt convinced that there was something wrong.",
"Governments and laws take these under their protection, and it is men who make governments and laws.",
"I do not read that tea was then in use.",
"But painting is very ancient.",
"He was entirely devoted to literature, took no interest in passing events, and lived to a good old age.",
"Who is happy with any amount of wealth?",
"Time has proved how well it can keep time.",
"They have no fixed minister.",
"Opinion that no clothing is necessary.",
"We generally use too much clothing.",
"Pure water.",
"Influence of religion on sleep.",
"Their clothing.",
"Very fine print.",
"But there are limits to the use of this article of clothing.",
"Something may be saved by a reasonable dress, as I have already shown.",
"They will get rid of it, however, when they can.",
"The general importance of pure air has been mentioned.",
"When is the time which would be devoted to it worth less than at this period?",
"After tea they had some music.",
"And they were tired out, and how lucky it was they had found a place to camp and company.",
"She was not convinced.",
"The minister noticed her.",
"How little a thing is needed for us to be lost or to be saved!",
"The train had begun to move out.",
"Yet even these were not constructed as they should have been.",
"But it was impossible, with the scientific knowledge of his day, to avoid errors, and we are surprised that he made so few.",
"He then took hold of both my hands, and we stood up.",
"It is not, however, to be considered as a model of pure taste.",
"The day after she went away, I stood upon my own feet without support, for the first time.",
"And such proved to be the fact.",
"Some lady?",
"These letters must have stood for something.",
"And his claim has been admitted from the first.",
"The tone is quite modern.",
"But it shows which way the popular impression lies.",
"It leaves a mixed impression on the mind.",
"How bright, how cold it was!",
"So he found his way through the door of the heart that stood wide open for him.",
"It is recorded that it sent the voice for a dozen miles.",
"This proved successful.",
"So these experiments also developed no practical improvement in the existing means of communication.",
"Here he was on the right path, and another long step forward had been taken.",
"Communication was maintained with the boat day after day, regardless of weather conditions.",
"These proved of great use.",
"Several of these systems are at present in practical and very effective operation.",
"I decided at once that I would not make myself known, but try the spirit of the man.",
"The work of the year was now well begun.",
"The effort was successful beyond my expectations.",
"The boy stood by the window long enough to see that his father had turned the corner toward the town.",
"The boy knew the path.",
"No boy that amounts to much ever does look the part, as the actors say.",
"It was his business to shoot, and be shot.",
"We have very little art, very little architecture, very little music of our own for the same reasons.",
"What is the use of serving good wine?",
"The morning was bright and warm.",
"After that experience the machine was allowed to go to the top without any more attempts to rest.",
"Her thoughts rest with the dead.",
"All that he described was passing like a vision before him.",
"To a certain extent he understood what was passing in her mind.",
"If he only would look up, she would read his thoughts, and tell him her own thoughts also.",
"Ages pass by.",
"How pure she was!",
"Many had proved, with more than words, that they did so.",
"Twice he was driven back before them all.",
"Something stood between her and the sun.",
"She had been lost in happy thoughts.",
"In her mind a vision was passing.",
"There was a general laugh.",
"We must run one down on the low grounds in the spring.",
"Remember there is nothing proved.",
"The contract was signed, and nothing proved against her.",
"Each was busy with his own thoughts.",
"Is it asked on what grounds?",
"Is that will ever proved?",
"When he had gone away, they stood looking at each other.",
"The spirit of the lost girl looked out of those eyes.",
"This path is very beautiful.",
"Even when most positive, they admitted a percentage of doubt.",
"Before my stay was over it got in the way of a passing train and was run over.",
"I cannot think the artist can have been quite easy in his mind about them.",
"It is not in print.",
"What he had asked of her had been simply at first not to laugh at him.",
"As this was his first impression of that it quite made a date.",
"What wealth!",
"After some moments I now spoke his name.",
"In a dark night careful driving is required in order not to go off into the water.",
"A noise behind me caused me to turn about.",
"Materials had also to be provided at once, and there was a penalty of so much a day if the job was not completed by a certain time.",
"He thought himself lucky if they died in the night.",
"I am a lucky one, I am.",
"By their love for each other they were both saved.",
"Of course, the man does not have to run the risk of the penalty.",
"The trip around the world means big moments of living.",
"I refused to believe it.",
"Even he was willing to split the distance with me.",
"Half a dozen would be around.",
"There stood the woman before me.",
"I had saved her life.",
"Faster and faster my board went, till it seemed my arms would drop off.",
"He could have remained by serving a year in prison.",
"She refused to give him a chance.",
"At the same moment the distance recorded on the log was noted.",
"I looked at the log.",
"Note carefully all that he says.",
"My heart almost stood still waiting the answer.",
"For the form of this world is passing away.",
"Give recognition to such men.",
"By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.",
"Did we not act in the same spirit and walk in the same steps?",
"Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?",
"This is the second death, the lake of fire.",
"Let each one be fully convinced in his own mind.",
"But I shall laugh.",
"He saw the woman turn her head and laugh to the man, and his head turn in response.",
"She stood looking at me.",
"But they are great as practical men.",
"My work had begun again.",
"Not one of them becomes a religion.",
"I happened to be passing just now, and seeing a light in here came in to investigate.",
"We must be rid of them.",
"If there is any beer on the ice, we prefer it to tea.",
"For dying I was, although now saved.",
"I will put in also one of my later attempts.",
"I am still very careful.",
"One of my oldest friends died recently, and this has given me new thoughts of death.",
"That, however, counts for much.",
"I have split over writing it.",
"Not begun, but all material ready.",
"There a minister can be something, not in a town.",
"That is one reason out of half a dozen why I so often prefer the first.",
"If it had been sent in time, it would have saved me a deal of trouble.",
"Or is it only afternoon tea?",
"When I say just a link, I guess I may be taken to mean a dozen.",
"A purchase.",
"To bind.",
"To bind up.",
"Clean shirt.",
"I laugh.",
"They then always saved towards the next week, which was generally a bad one.",
"Some were passing through, others were running from door to door.",
"It proved to be more difficult to help them than I had thought.",
"The same thing occurs in the matter of clothing.",
"Well, I will not enter here into a discussion as to how far any one who does not take beauty and the value of beauty into account can claim to be practical at all.",
"On asking the charge they refused to make any, and would not receive anything.",
"I saw the operation performed on a dear little bright girl this morning.",
"They eat of the same food, and at the same time as the men, laugh and talk before them, and receive equal support and respect in old age."],

"Of the second kind, nearly every phase of it begins right here, that men and women demand for labor something which they have not earned.",
"No sign of struggle.",
"All of us who know him will appreciate that.",
"But of one thing he would not be denied.",
"The men, too, seemed struck with some such idea.",
"The men did not object.",
"This was no chance of sport now, but a struggle for very life.",
"There was no struggle.",
"This, on closer examination, proved to be the cover of a book.",
"One fact I made out by accident, looking down from a high place.",
"He was singing.",
"He had gone down and died without a struggle.",
"How little of these does childhood know!",
"Add some sugar to taste.",
"Prices very moderate.",
"This great combination machine is the last and greatest improvement on all former machines.",
"Money is no object whatever to us.",
"Whether it exists or not, it is reality to me and in no way a dream.",
"We retired as usual to rest.",
"As a matter of fact the marriage had happened entirely by accident.",
"Then the hero arrived.",
"She was divided at first between a desire to laugh and cry.",
"She was having a holiday.",
"She thought of her own childhood in a happy home where there was always plenty to eat and plenty of money to buy things that were needed.",
"The children began to cry.",
"He suffered very much.",
"In a moment he gave a cry and fell back dead.",
"At last she decided to go on a short trip through that country to encourage the black workers she had sent there.",
"All the women know how to farm.",
"Above all, she wanted to get money to support the industrial home for women which she had planned.",
"She started the building of the industrial home for women and girls.",
"The doctor gave her an examination.",
"He holds a victim in his mind.",
"But the farm was reached by more open methods.",
"We cry out together.",
"On a holiday I was at it early.",
"If only I could master the tools!",
"The chair was empty.",
"To the boys he was a hero indeed.",
"That was but natural, seeing he not only taught them to read and write, and tried to get them situations, but treated them as his friends.",
"But in that force every man was a hero.",
"It was a terrible struggle for these men at first.",
"Somehow or other his master found out this plan, and determined to put a stop to it.",
"He, however, by accident happened to go home that night another way.",
"My hands are empty.",
"The room was empty.",
"Several more boys entered, and one of them struck a light.",
"If they do this they will be of benefit to the sport.",
"It is a high class sport in the main, managed by high class, men for high class purposes.",
"Then he struck out.",
"But why not wait till the family returns?",
"Wood was then ready for business again.",
"The very moderate density of these bodies had been well established.",
"I notice, however, that they continue playing in the afternoon since then, I suppose it struck them as a good idea at the time.",
"We would not limit the proposed extension of their education, however, to the study of art, alone.",
"By what possible chance could a child of that age know how to manage money?",
"My taste is books and I farm it.",
"I think my heart is breaking.",
"An accident.",
"It was not fair to burden any one with a business so involved as his was now.",
"Can it be that I am a victim of it too?",
"It had never struck him that she could die.",
"I want trees and water and fields.",
"He was beginning to realize that a hand, without a heart, is an empty thing.",
"Well, they must try to have a truly impressive service.",
"Was it possible he could get used to the atmosphere?",
"He dropped back into a chair.",
"Empty, as usual.",
"The whole world was hard as iron.",
"Each man fell to considering what he would do, how he would manage if he were alone.",
"But he was not as happy as a man should be who has just struck pay.",
"Simply the block of wood.",
"Certainly the ice was very late breaking up this year.",
"From end to end of the settlement the cry was taken up.",
"The man addressed never turned his head.",
"He had never given it to her before, and he forgot that few people would care now to take it.",
"It does not refer to a second run of the play.",
"I shall not fail.",
"What was that struck me?",
"When we make our visit the day is fine and the room is empty, the children are all outside.",
"How did he know that she had sat in his chair?",
"The teacher must read to be ready with help if the children fail, and also to be ready with the actual problems.",
"The children would have been happy enough, but they would not have been trained to live as individuals.",
"Out of this, as well as out of our direct experience, we build our ideal.",
"It is here that the individual paint box is so important.",
"The farm.",
"His burden was now far more than any man could bear.",
"They have struck for bigger things.",
"A thought suddenly struck me.",
"Then a notion struck me.",
"I came out of the wood a new being.",
"And now the atmosphere became more distinct to her.",
"I turned round and saw it was the master of the shop, who had come to the door on seeing me.",
"When I came to myself, it seemed to me that there was a change in the atmosphere and the light.",
"It is just a cry.",
"And nobody had taken the trouble to make a very close examination into the facts.",
"Talking to him, I almost forgot what we were going to do.",
"When all at once, quite suddenly, close to us, at our feet, there broke out a cry.",
"Cry out no more to man.",
"My father did so with a wave of his hand.",
"The picture was large, and in a heavy frame, but my father would let no one help me but himself.",
"I stood with my hand upon the back of his chair.",
"It exists, and the same thing is true about it, at the present day.",
"But the examination?",
"I forgot!",
"He came round the table and sat down in the big chair.",
"The man at the table held out his empty glass.",
"It sounds impressive.",
"I can see very well the atmosphere is not my atmosphere.",
"What is the purpose of primary intellectual education?",
"It was an accident in one sense.",
"First, get down to first principles.",
"And he struck me!",
"Such an understanding, or even the atmosphere in which such an understanding may grow, has still to be created.",
"And when he spoke his voice had altered.",
"Not until he was close under its wall did he come to appreciate its size.",
"Out of this district he passed quickly onto the main street, and here there was a different atmosphere.",
"As for the others, they were cool players themselves, but here they had met their master.",
"It was not an affair of breaking the others who sat in.",
"He received, however, an additional burden at once.",
"But I fail.",
"It was the first sign that he was breaking down under the strain.",
"He spent the day in that chair.",
"He was only a man, and, since his heart was empty, he wanted something that might fill it.",
"And then, from the girl, a low cry.",
"Please understand that I set this down in no spirit of criticism.",
"How does it happen that each of the victims is struck on the right hand?",
"It had been merely accident, after all.",
"I just happened to come past a few minutes after the accident.",
"They fired their guns to let him know where they were.",
"But she killed the rest just for sport.",
"He liked to draw so well, that sometimes he forgot to do his work.",
"Perhaps he forgot that there was any school.",
"One of them fired.",
"If he missed a word, he would cry.",
"They did not like to make the little fellow cry.",
"Wine and sugar.",
"Are its detailed applications effective?",
"For each of the following pairs frame a sentence which shall contain one of the members.",
"Every person is master of both.",
"Do any of the terms fail to make sense at all?",
"I have lost my reputation.",
"Estimate, value, appreciate.",
"My master was immediately sent for.",
"When my master returned from the island, his wife told him of the affair, but for the present he seemed to take no notice of it, and mentioned not a word of it to me.",
"I think I struck him, and then I ran away.",
"Criticism was harder to meet when the critics were cool.",
"One is forced to pay for breaking rules!",
"His master did not guide him.",
"Was she, too, struck with death?",
"I tried to paint her face as it must have been.",
"Do not fail me.",
"Those who loved either her person or her works will find her place forever empty.",
"And here is the true singing of the deep sea.",
"The settlement of the estate, so far as the world knew, was an easy matter.",
"The injury was serious.",
"We retired together to a room apart.",
"Throughout a long discussion in which some of these women participated I was able to follow and get their point of view.",
"The object was to prove that there was direct cause and effect.",
"It has been demonstrated that our girls from college and city trade can do farm work, and do it with a will.",
"One of the references must be a woman.",
"Later they were told, in a measure, but even then they were denied the whole truth.",
"Then he addressed them again.",
"He had been struck with a great light.",
"Something strange about the former arrested his eye.",
"Try and get them to be accurate as to the time, as we want to fix the time of the crime as near as possible.",
"Then the explanation struck him.",
"We want somebody who can manage the jury.",
"Instead of doing so he forgot all about it.",
"Did he want a plan of an empty house?",
"He did not know my voice, and he ran away from me with a cry.",
"Then I sat down in a chair and thought what I must do.",
"For what object?",
"Each of them fired one shot.",
"How far was he prepared to go in carrying out that object?",
"He fired and missed.",
"I struck one while the thought was hot within me, and again took a look at the room.",
"They were both empty.",
"I should have suffered less.",
"Near them sat a few relatives and friends.",
"We have arrested a man.",
"She had earned her good times.",
"Indeed, in one particular I was even more exact in my details than at any previous examination.",
"My hand was empty.",
"It was in the room, in the air all about him, even when the girl or his master was not near.",
"Not until he had followed his master out through the door and into the street did he begin to understand.",
"Why had not his master returned?",
"Once more he heard the cry, and only once.",
"He was master.",
"Here he had found ideal conditions.",
"He knew that this man was his master, and for the time his spirit was gone.",
"He forgot the chain that held him.",
"She gets up then and brings him some wood.",
"Her master beat her till she had enough.",
"The master began to laugh.",
"I could move neither hand nor foot, struggle as I might.",
"What man would care to read his name between the lines of such a news item as this?",
"Wealth is not our final object in life.",
"There it is, with a gap between it and the next word.",
"And I began to cry, for it was the first time my mother had ever shut me from her presence.",
"I shall never claim the estate.",
"Since the general is dead, that position no longer exists.",
"Had there been an accident?",
"The human frame could not waste.",
"He was dead in his chair.",
"How are we to give effect to the cry?",
"So far the improvement exists only on paper.",
"They have lots of new and improved machines.",
"The wood is still a wood of death, actual or potential.",
"Special courses for special subjects began to be set up.",
"I will quote a few of those which have not yet seen the light.",
"In a moment an answer came from another part of the wood.",
"And yet the person struck down was a woman, and not a man!",
"That altered the case entirely.",
"Terms were adjusted, which removed not the ground of difference.",
"It has been maintained that this story will not bear criticism.",
"Then they decided on going out again, and they took in water and wood of the dry trees, which it seems the river brings down when it comes from the mountain.",
"Yet the struggle was final.",
"A great many men go into it, but they fail for want of capital.",
"The author is careful of his reputation.",
"Sleep in a chair.",
"It was hard not to cry.",
"But, each time, almost before they had started, came the deep report of another round fired.",
"If his chair had been of hot iron, he could not have moved more quickly.",
"A chair for the lady, my son.",
"Strange how little he had changed, and how much I had expected to see him altered.",
"He went to the master for an explanation.",
"Then there was a crash of glass.",
"Somehow with that first crash on our front door, I knew that the game had turned.",
"He raised his arm and fired.",
"The man looked intellectual.",
"I forgot to ask the reason.",
"The road is empty otherwise.",
"Mountain, who was present at their talk.",
"Mountain, giving him her hand.",
"He had no news of his master since the morning of the action.",
"Examination over?",
"It represented intellectual, but not moral culture.",
"To their own master they stand or fall.",
"It is not the highest ideal.",
"Each in turn must fail.",
"The picture presented to the mind is more consistent, according to the altered reading.",
"The special references appear to be these.",
"And this was precisely what did happen.",
"I was now of an age to appreciate a quiet life, and I had run risks enough.",
"In fact, the mountain trip is rather cool.",
"So they made their way through the long train to the tourist coach, and there found the girl they were seeking.",
"So far the old man had not addressed a word to anyone.",
"I am forgot.",
"This it has cost me a severe struggle to part with.",
"It was a day that will stand out like a mountain, I am sure, in my life.",
"Is the chair empty?",
"My very style seems to myself to become more impressive than usual, with the change of theme.",
"My friend is master of the school.",
"The place was empty, and the door was open.",
"The awful sound of breaking glass.",
"Fields, by the way, said I was wonderful in it.",
"Fields must have been in her day.",
"But I have been in his fields.",
"The one I see out there in my fields?",
"So we have both suffered.",
"But he could not prevent the speech from producing its effect.",
"Thus was the result of the great struggle decided.",
"But her personal beauty was not the only thing that arrested attention.",
"Hence she never forgot what she had once learned.",
"She was at the crucial point of a difficult game.",
"She knew something that no master had ever taught her.",
"I am more or less my own master.",
"What is it, by the way, that brings peace to the atmosphere of a room, of a whole house sometimes?",
"He sat back in his chair, content for the moment with the progress he had made.",
"He only half forgot it.",
"Women rarely realize situations in time.",
"She had never known them fail.",
"We all carry with us through life somewhat of the scenes through which we passed in childhood.",
"The room was filled with smoke.",
"He brought forward a chair.",
"He thought that I ought to have fired.",
"The great crash will come, not by force of arms, but by ways of peace.",
"She turned slowly and went back to her chair.",
"They will go on trying until the crash comes.",
"He knew the note to strike, and struck with a sure hand.",
"The process of getting adjusted to its conditions was ended.",
"In this atmosphere one almost felt that anything was possible.",
"The church, small as it was, seemed almost empty.",
"Leaders were being trained.",
"Perhaps I appreciate it more than I realized.",
"He had fired it among a crowd of women and children.",
"It will be easy to understand this, when we reflect on those leading principles by which the life of an animal is supported and maintained.",
"Several of its species grow wild in low situations in the country.",
"If required to be kept any length of time, rather a larger proportion of sugar must be used.",
"To be able to iron properly requires much practice and experience.",
"He thought the first loss the least, and has not altered his opinion.",
"The next return post brought, not the expected letter, but our hero himself.",
"Many say to me that an old woman like me is not able to bring up and manage a little child.",
"Whenever she went with me into the garden and through the estate, she taught me all about the trees and flowers.",
"This made it very dark, despite the fact that the wood was small.",
"It was a man who had half raised himself on the long chair which was covered by the skin.",
"The scene was the yard of a farm.",
"It struck something soft.",
"In the other case, they can carry it on on moral or intellectual lines.",
"At last the crucial time had come.",
"His master stroke met with immediate success.",
"Were each gun fired only once an hour, there would be a shot every second.",
"Without it we shall not get the full benefit of this struggle.",
"But the hour had not yet struck for war.",
"See, good master!",
"However, he pulled himself together, and went on with his examination of the picture.",
"This means did not fail of its effect.",
"No war of this kind and on this scale is good enough to fight unless it is good enough to fail in.",
"They have never failed under a strain of this kind, and they will not fail now.",
"The disease was never so serious as they thought it, and now, thanks to them, we are in a fair way to recovery.",
"No sound will remain in our fields of war.",
"The wind is heard in the mountain.",
"But if he gets control of affairs, he will not fail to act precisely as they did, or still worse.",
"His reputation with the soldiers?",
"Then he noticed the paper addressed to him in a strange hand.",
"Sitting up, somewhat confused, and looking around me, I became aware that some strange accident had occurred.",
"Here, again, our steps were arrested.",
"But at that moment my purpose was arrested.",
"The hour of great trial has struck for our nation.",
"At the proper time we shall refer to that again.",
"These fields are human to my father.",
"Why could not women, who suffered most, have some word in the regulation of events?",
"She saw him struggle with what he could not understand.",
"He almost pulled the driver out of his seat.",
"In the car remained the driver and another man.",
"That driver could drive!",
"It was empty.",
"I loved the farm.",
"It struck him that there was more light then when the attack began.",
"And it struck him that this, somehow, was going to be hard.",
"The deep, impressive voice ended.",
"And a current seemed to wave from him around that dark square of figures.",
"He would not be denied.",
"That space before him was empty, but it was charged with current.",
"Most of them struck far back.",
"Shot after shot he fired, missing.",
"He fired as he ran.",
"What could that object be?",
"With all my force I struck!",
"The chair was a heavy one, and I struck with all my strength.",
"Yet how could we fail?",
"Please do not fail me.",
"A little cry of fear broke from her.",
"It was a column of smoke.",
"He dropped his burden and went back to her.",
"But she did not draw back from him, and she did not cry out.",
"She was saved, and though it was cold and dark and still, she felt her heart singing within her.",
"She put fresh wood on the fire.",
"Then she had gone down again for wood.",
"It is however necessary that the principles should be this very thing, the principle alone.",
"For if it was body, it would not yet be the object of sense.",
"But this energy, as being characterized by the essential, will necessarily be different in different producing causes.",
"That is why we have meant to explore them and have never done so.",
"To refer, somewhat more in detail, to the features of this edition.",
"What she had seen and suffered turned her brain.",
"When the doctor went back to his office, he sat long in his chair in front of the fire, and thought.",
"He had seen it in the faces of little children, his patients, who, though hurt, would not cry.",
"Most of the members just sit and smoke all the time, and read the papers, and call the pages.",
"They can always manage somehow.",
"He could not frame the words.",
"Some people thought women were hard to manage!",
"There are always some who fail to show up at the last.",
"But there is a gap between us.",
"But soon be looked around, as if seeking some familiar object, which did not meet his eye.",
"To indicate the references would have been impossible.",
"They heard a cry for help.",
"What is our object?",
"That is our first object.",
"She never struck a little dog with her hand or a stick.",
"Wood went up to them.",
"Wood kept one.",
"Wood, going up to her.",
"Wood believed in having plenty of pure water for all his animals and they all had their own place to get a drink.",
"After that I often used to watch her as she went about the farm.",
"Wood was usually driving her.",
"She had not been properly broken in.",
"Wood, looking down at me.",
"The woman put it aside and told him master would beat him.",
"Then he forgot the rest.",
"When tea was half over, she gave a little cry.",
"Wood began.",
"I fired.",
"Wood said he was not.",
"Wood tell them anything about him?",
"He must have struck some other station.",
"Wood would have nothing to do with it.",
"Wood looked behind the log at me.",
"Wood thought the same.",
"Never take a holiday.",
"Wood called after them.",
"Then he sat down in a chair and looked at them.",
"Wood came to the station to see us off.",
"He looked as if he understood every word that his master was saying.",
"The driver ran to his head, but he was quite dead.",
"It was not dead, but seemed stupid with the smoke.",
"Master sent me back.",
"I went driving, too, and sometimes we met my master.",
"By and by he stood, letter in hand, before the person to whom it was addressed.",
"He suffered.",
"How the line of least resistance and greatest advantage is determined for and taken by him is a fascinating process.",
"These are some of the master types.",
"They form the units of the intellectual process.",
"He struck a match.",
"Might manage to make a fire somehow, and stand it out.",
"They stayed up until quite late, singing songs of school and college life, and having a happy time.",
"But we can get plenty of things to exhibit in the domestic department.",
"No smoke without some fire.",
"Strike when the iron is hot.",
"Still he denied himself.",
"The struggle was not long.",
"His object is to travel through the whole world.",
"But maybe he forgot to.",
"I forgot.",
"He said he was a hero, and that he had a camp of his own now.",
"But anyway, they admitted that he was a hero.",
"Only the smoke.",
"She could barely touch the lower frame.",
"The moment our hero entered the room, the attention of every person present was fixed upon him.",
"She retired indeed, but not to rest.",
"The struggle has cost me something, but it is over.",
"My reputation is established.",
"They now retired to rest.",
"We had a struggle under water.",
"Trust the firm to encourage that!",
"What sport!",
"I forgot that.",
"Saw the smoke, as I ran.",
"What would have happened to her if her grandmother had looked in!",
"The difference struck me.",
"She talked like some little old grandmother.",
"She had lost money and was partly dependent upon relatives.",
"There did seem to be a good many things to cry about this morning.",
"He loved his mother and his brother and sister, and he worked for them on the farm at home.",
"Do cry, child.",
"I could not fail to notice it.",
"West, her voice breaking.",
"I never forgot it.",
"But an accident!",
"It was a fascinating thing to watch, and at this distance to the side he was quite safe.",
"To be sure, if a man stood there, he could easily have fired into the room and into the breast of a man sitting on the far side of the table.",
"But he fired for another purpose.",
"And then when they tried to break him he started doing some breaking on his own account.",
"This was the ideal.",
"He managed to get out of the chair, and accepted the offer of her arm, but held back for a moment.",
"It was grand exercise for me and great sport for them.",
"And where there is smoke, there must be fire.",
"They looked in the big chair.",
"It would be sufficient if it became an ideal of beauty.",
"Never had anything struck him as more significant.",
"And while the estate spread the children grew.",
"And, like the estate, the children also grew.",
"All was disaster in his home.",
"Its master dead, it had died also.",
"Year by year the new master increased his trade with all the countries of the world.",
"And, without a cry, he fell.",
"How even name all those who entered the farm, how simply set forth their names, their ages, their degree of relationship, the health, the strength, and the hope that they had brought into the world!",
"It is the age of independent criticism.",
"The work of reading is play to a child whose eye has been thus trained.",
"So would my master, had he not run away.",
"Master, bear this and bear all.",
"Father, let me alone, I do it but to make myself some sport.",
"My master!",
"Not in first edit.",
"First edit.",
"As I spoke I could see the struggle that was going on within him.",
"Empty it, and come along.",
"Breaking stone.",
"No further examination will be necessary.",
"This is especially the case with regard to industrial legislation.",
"But he had no one to encourage and support him.",
"Then it was run into the shops and taken down for examination.",
"Wood, too, has had the same kind of experience.",
"By the accident of birth alone they had been put in a position different from other men.",
"That was about all the struggle established.",
"Such a community of interests exists already, in a larger or smaller degree, among many states, though it is unknown to most people.",
"Real democracy exists only when all men are free and equal.",
"At the same time the fragments grew rapidly.",
"They are not thinking of what they are singing.",
"He had not heard the address given to the driver.",
"The driver stood up.",
"How things were suffered to go on thus, I cannot guess.",
"Is childhood dead?",
"There is no breaking the fall.",
"He is the only free man in the universe.",
"I thought it looked upon me with a sense of injury.",
"It seemed to me that I had more time on my hands than I could ever manage.",
"I am now as if I had never been other than my own master.",
"I cry out too late to save.",
"There let him fix if he can.",
"A happy thought struck me.",
"There are several paintings in different parts of the church, which we heard were considered as very fine.",
"Then I looked for the cycle shop, found it quickly enough but discovered that the item I wanted was out of stock and would be available only the next week.",
"However one has to master the techniques and follow all the procedures and requirements very carefully.",
"Usually any one of the students would briefly guide me in the work that I was assigned for the day after which I would manage on my own.",
"After that everybody left as it was declared a holiday.",
"They fell on the ground but suffered no damage and just continued running around.",
"Yes, several times, mostly by accident.",
"This makes it almost impossible to have any rare or unusual career courses.",
"Yet this, like other general characters, will sometimes fail.",
"To those from whom something had been taken, something in return might properly be given.",
"Something was to be provided, and something to be adjusted.",
"His principles both of thought and action were great and comprehensive.",
"I struggle hard for life.",
"I have made little progress in recovery.",
"Nor did he fail us.",
"But the newspaper had suffered.",
"As the train lost itself in smoke I knew well what he felt.",
"The item was brief.",
"I thought it important to let her know clearly and at once just who was the master in my own house.",
"As soon as I could manage it I went back to him with the water, but I must have been gone a long time.",
"The burden was not all to be mine.",
"It was difficult at first to suspect that she actually meant to try me to the breaking point.",
"She says only an iron will can correct it.",
"He was in a bad fix.",
"The farm was of very little value.",
"Then he addressed the native.",
"I forgot all about it.",
"Mother was a regular old hero about it and I dropped everything, and come off.",
"The town would have suffered, and this they could not risk.",
"And in its course and effect it fully acts up to its reputation.",
"Much good is done by the influence of friends properly employed.",
"He had, at last, found one person who could appreciate him.",
"Then must not the ideal man be a son also?",
"It has suffered for it.",
"But when a whole country has one mind, one will, when a whole country has been denied justice, it is no longer a question of party politics, it is a matter of life and death.",
"The same struggle is going on all over the world.",
"Both give place to respect when they fail to produce the intended effect.",
"Medical students have refused to appear for their final examination.",
"The opening at which I stopped was quite a large one, and when I put my light inside I found it was entirely empty.",
"The moment I looked at the person who addressed me I knew him.",
"We were struck with the quiet and good order of all these schools.",
"This was the life the hero of this story began.",
"He continued to raise his head and body without a struggle.",
"The boat was broken into pieces and the fragments were brought out to them.",
"The gun was trained and fired.",
"This has been denied.",
"Not a shot was fired, for she was still far away.",
"The wedding day was made a public holiday in the village.",
"She turned in her chair a little more towards him.",
"She sat up in her chair with a happy little laugh.",
"Lots of work to do, so they just stuck me down in her chair.",
"Whatever might lie behind, he had struck for the future which he meant to live and enjoy.",
"She indicated the others with a little wave of the hand.",
"I looked at it, and I remember I gave a little cry of interest.",
"Their master turned to them.",
"There was a cry.",
"Even his tone was altered.",
"He was suddenly an altered person.",
"He found the box door open and the box itself, to his surprise, empty.",
"The driver saw his chance and took it.",
"He might have been an empty gas bag, not a man.",
"The object proved to be a log.",
"Who fired it?",
"Something in her tone arrested his attention.",
"The box was empty!",
"Empty, as anything that can be empty is empty!",
"I have virtually altered nothing now.",
"Now this photo.",
"It is empty.",
"She had not thought to cry out.",
"She seemed perfectly willing to carry the burden on her back.",

"It should be placed, however, in such a situation as to indicate the real temperature of the atmosphere, and not where it will give a false result.",
"General principles.",
"Some cry out against this practice as dangerous, but I have never found it so.",
"If it be healthy, and quite easy in its dress, it will hardly ever cry at all.",
"I am not so hard a master.",
"It is a solid mass of stone, which has suffered less from time than the mountains near it.",
"He gave ideal beauty to his figures, but it was in form rather than in expression.",
"What was to be expected of a class who had no object to live for?",
"But I am no way altered from my opinion of it, at least, with any reasons which have opposed it.",
"All which, the hero on the other side, is to drive in before him.",
"Perhaps they have had a small estate left them, which they knew not the getting of.",

"A certain description of ability cannot be denied to him.",
"There is no luck, no accident, in all this.",
"Has he lost his reputation through crime?",
"Is he struck through with disease?",
"Men had found that it was more effective to work together through organizations than to struggle along as individuals.",
"How terrible the percentage of those who fail!",

"He said his object in it had not been understood.",
"Empty thoughts!",
"It is not given to all men to be so fascinating.",
"The driver has no choice.",
"The old man, standing at the foot, struck match after match to light him.",

"She gave a wild cry.",
"A shot is fired close at hand.",
"A shot was fired.",
"When crash!",
"There is one spring room in it that holds the very atmosphere of spring.",

"It is one of the main businesses of my life to explore this district.",
"With what art do not these people manage their fire.",
"Item, he is to keep the church clean.",
"I cannot survive him.",
"We were speaking, not of plants, but of machines.",
"He could not even cry out.",
"Again I heard that awful cry!",
"The man addressed did not move.",
"An accident decided the question.",
"His intellectual existence, however, was not particularly happy.",
"Then, without any progress, came the rise in the price of iron, and so forth.",
"Some men are determined by principles, and others are drawn and directed by a vision or a face.",
"Here is the sea, the wind, and the wave.",
"And I say it failed because I saw it fail, and not because I believe it failed.",
"I had a feeling that I was holding on to the dream as well as the chair.",

"It was there he lost his reputation.",
"There will be a mountain of them.",
"It was an impressive scene!",
"The man was a hero.",
"And he went up on the mountain, and sat down there.",
"Here was sport.",
"Mother and grandmother, all the way back they had married.",
"Often my grandmother and my mother told me of it.",
"When the iron is hot!",
"What I wanted the doctors to do was to fix me up, so that I could go on at home.",
"Only those who live in the open air and watch the fields and sea from hour to hour and day to day know what they are and what they mean.",
"The attitude struck him.",
"He is always visiting.",
"His whole manner altered.",
"They are breaking me in very fast, however.",
"Here, there is nothing to appreciate.",
"Cut him in fragments?",
"This he accepted, and we retired.",
"Whenever I get into the mountain, I trust I shall rapidly pick up.",
"The doctor thinks well of my recovery, which puts me in good hope for the future.",
"Do not fail us.",
"And after all, because we run this risk, it does not follow we should fail.",
"This is also my first letter since my recovery.",
"I hope we may manage to stay there all winter.",
"My mother returns next month.",
"One is for our house here, and should be addressed as above.",
"One generation further might be nothing, but it is my present object of desire, and we are so near it!",
"But how fascinating!",
"A chair.",
"Pregnant, big with child.",
"Its object and its consequences are the same.",
"Milk and sugar are not used.",
"Hardly any house has paper windows, and in the few which have, they are so black with smoke as to look worse than none.",

"Grant, and listen to me.",
"Grant is telling the truth.",
"Grant the greatest possible help.",
"Such men are to be hired.",
"Perhaps it was her fault.",
"Grant is far, very far, from being clear of responsibility in that matter.",
"She literally ran into the house.",
"Grant was then.",
"On the next day the storm broke.",
"She was not angry now.",
"In fact, he had almost every taste to a considerable degree.",
"At last he grew angry, and they told him to kill them, as they were quite unable to go forward.",
"The charge was as successful as it was sudden.",
"Different grounds of hope and fear were represented to different persons.",
"Nevertheless it is true.",
"There must be a fault somewhere.",
"God grant that they may understand all that it means.",
"God grant that the effect may be permanent.",
"God grant that I may believe it with my whole heart.",
"God grant that they may do so before it is too late.",
"God grant it.",
"I consider his a most valuable life, and I am deeply interested in his safety.",
"The story of the bridge is interesting.",
"And we laid him back and he died.",
"Then the boy was gone, and she came back slowly to the breakfast table, with the thing in her hand.",
"To his surprise it proved to be only a few blocks away.",
"They had been noticed sharing their breakfast together at the kitchen.",
"There was only one house where no relief was needed.",
"She was on his list of relief cases.",
"In another case a woman, who was said to be too weak to apply for relief, was visited.",
"The state of things has no parallel in all history.",
"These works were written for adults, but older children who have an advanced understanding may appreciate them, too.",
"Since then, many people have contributed.",
"There were no neighbors to speak of.",
"At the time, he had agreed to these visits.",
"Nevertheless one was in existence.",
"Not the present alone, but the future, was being laid waste.",
"It is this that makes the record of her life so valuable for all time.",
"The new home was not more than a quarter of a mile from the old one.",
"Changes of circumstances now came to her relief.",
"From the opening of the new buildings the schools advanced rapidly.",
"It happened that the object of their guilty loves was the same.",
"Time leaves its mark upon all of us.",
"Mark the last.",
"He walked on, almost roughly.",
"No more than she has been sending.",
"I suppose I was upset.",
"I try in several languages.",
"Our daily life is made possible only by the fact that we know so little of our neighbors.",
"There was something wanting in the story, which she could not supply.",
"Literally everybody wants to play.",
"Once he stopped by the open port.",
"Hang him and welcome.",
"Then he gave a little laugh of relief.",
"Without the first, no household can be said to be well managed.",
"This mark can easily be made with a file.",
"When the dinner has been served, the most important feature in the daily life of the cook is at an end.",
"This is rather an expensive preparation.",
"Their progress might be at the rate of about a mile an hour.",
"The mixture will then be ready for use.",
"Wine so laid in will be ready for use according to its quality and age.",
"The affair was made more complicated by the entrance of other parties into the conflict.",
"Never was man more at fault!",
"False men leave no mark.",
"The address was well received at first, but had no permanent effect.",
"Her loss was a heavy one, especially to her own household.",
"Such a result is the product of no sudden culture.",
"The worst of it is that it is my fault.",
"After that there would be no end to their visits.",
"Grant could be heard from.",
"Grant himself led the charge.",
"Of such a war, once begun, no man could predict the end.",
"They went, literally, until they dropped.",
"The incident took place during a charge.",
"We have none of us passed through this experience without receiving its mark.",
"Also places food and fuel under federal control.",
"But what can one man, however able and advanced, do against the current of his age?",
"No one, surely, can look at the war and say that nations are moved only by their material interests.",
"In some ways we are stronger than we have been in all our long history.",
"The only real check on war is an understanding between nations.",
"He loves to reduce things to their elements.",
"Yet these were changes in tone and manner rather than in fundamental views.",
"Grant declared.",
"I would have laid down life a dozen times not only to achieve it myself, but even to know that it had been achieved by others.",
"That one I am here to arrest.",
"Each meeting adopted a resolution against war.",
"The hired men were still at table.",
"Driving back east was a relief.",
"He looked angry.",
"They had all been to breakfast.",
"Before she finished breakfast her mother came in again.",
"He must be carried by storm.",
"Magic words!",
"Perhaps they were facing it.",
"They were shooting.",
"He loves me.",
"They cannot be denied, I grant.",
"If he were buying books, and there was a variety of binding, he always chose the copies with red covers.",
"It looked on first entrance like an intelligence office.",
"Must a common cook always be a girl?",
"God grant they both lived, and became again free men.",
"No doubt he sold for his neighbors also.",
"What might be the purpose of his entrance?",
"Open the port there and let in some fresh air.",
"I knew little of the men who had responded to my call, and chosen me as leader.",
"It seemed to be only a game in which rich persons could enter.",
"So breakfast was finally finished, and the boys separated.",
"They looked to the right and to the left as they advanced.",
"That they were virtually separated was clear.",
"I am learning more about animals every day, and when the season is over I will be an expert animal man.",
"They took turns with the one cup.",
"She let him help her into the car he had hired.",
"And then, there in the kitchen, they sat down to breakfast.",
"It could be done even though the storm continued.",
"The storm caught us.",
"Again, all of a sudden, she saw it.",
"Is it my fault I am fair?",
"How can I be in fault?",
"Ice is very strong when once it is well frozen.",
"Every farm in the community was made more valuable because of their efforts.",
"He just laid them out.",
"So, although the neighbors would not receive the woman, they took the name she brought.",
"Would letting politics enter the home help matters.",
"The summer advanced, and became one of extreme heat.",
"But love is stronger even than hate.",
"Sometimes they made signs to us that they were going to shoot us, or hang us, or cut our heads off.",
"He had to start out very early in the morning, in order to supply his customers with milk for breakfast.",
"At the same time, she never laid her hand suddenly on any animal.",
"We never began till a book was laid before us.",
"I shall tell my cook whenever she sees him to give him something to eat.",
"I sent my dog home, and my father and some of the neighbors came.",
"The shooting had to be quick.",
"They hang on our words and looks, and are dependent on us in almost every way.",
"Wood never had his hired men live in his own house.",
"In the morning the boys went down town before breakfast and learned all about the fire.",
"The boys came home, and got their breakfast and went to school.",
"Until he got well he was separated from us.",
"For mark what he did.",
"Well, I hope they will not be angry with me for saying it.",
"I, at least, shall certainly not he angry with them.",
"Well then, there we are at fault, it seems.",
"No one asks why there are so many little lives.",
"Even the intelligence common to the higher animals is wanting.",
"But under stress and strain the balance is upset.",
"Besides, there are a number of other relationships between them that might be cited.",
"But what is the inner mechanism of the process?",
"Recall the classic example cited.",
"But it is useful because it points a parallel and an ideal.",
"That something no one could predict.",
"Then a sudden thought came into his mind.",
"At any rate it would mark the breaking of the storm.",
"They finally arrived at a point not a quarter of a mile from camp.",
"But get off and have breakfast.",
"The storm passed as quickly as it came.",
"Nor what will happen to the mark.",
"He is chosen by a special college elected by the people.",
"A miss is as good as a mile.",
"He that plants trees loves others besides himself.",
"Our progress, mark!",
"There is nothing parallel to this in classic literature.",
"Then all of a sudden he happened to think and he looked around to see if anyone was coming.",
"I looked over there and saw it upset and no one was near it.",
"We have to be partners, kind of.",
"Then all of a sudden a thought came to me.",
"But their visits had never been returned.",
"But I will never be separated from her any more.",
"She had a great deal to tell, and the whole household was ready to listen.",
"Boy reports it upset.",
"Very sudden.",
"The little group stood at fault.",
"The line of fire thus revealed, revealed the mark.",
"But then across the storm she heard her mother calling in the dark, and had to open her mouth to answer.",
"But if I were a man I would be professor of languages somewhere and teach that every word has a soul, and a history because it has a soul.",
"Preparation is needed to receive the truth.",
"Father is not strong enough to face any kind of a storm, and I am sure they will not attempt to start.",
"That chocolate makes me feel so.",
"She loves him more than any of us.",
"Is there chocolate enough?",
"The relief from her burden, at times, was almost harder to bear than the burden itself.",
"I am sure they spoke of sending it.",
"He made a considerable winning.",
"That would be enough for breakfast, at least.",
"He began eating before the regular breakfast at the little hotel was ready.",
"He asks simply that the men may die.",
"Nevertheless, it seemed, that was just what he had done.",
"He had but one fault.",
"The little girl had found out what the cook had done.",
"The law is that there must always be an excess of children in order that there may be enough cheap workers.",
"As nobody thought of sending them away they remained there, and saw and heard everything.",
"So we gave up the idea of any shooting.",
"I am taking her a little chocolate now.",
"The shooting would be good.",
"By love, and resolution, and action, they had created a world.",
"She has a right feeling towards her neighbors, and to all those on whom she depends.",
"What brings this cup?",
"So shall it in this resolution.",
"How now, what sudden chance is this?",
"Falls it so heavy?",
"These words are wanting in first edit.",
"After they had had breakfast she was wild to go out into the snow.",
"We advanced well.",
"Every foot of that space was valuable.",
"It is not the people who have been ruling there of late.",
"In the preparation of these estimates there are no unknown factors.",
"The design of the work offers nothing that is new in principle to engineering science.",
"The dying man laid with closed eyes, and did not move until his son spoke to him.",
"He was at fault again.",
"I saw the incident from this window.",
"He usually could see her from where he elected to sit.",
"It was not his fault that I did not profit more.",
"The actors were men and women painted.",
"Nevertheless, strange stories got about.",
"The interest would warm in the next act, against which a special incident was provided.",
"No blame attached either to judge or victim.",
"Why are taxes assessed unless they are collected?",
"A funny, but expensive incident happened to me on the way.",
"Many of the representatives of the people can hardly be said to have been chosen at all.",
"The law of nations made little of his knowledge.",
"The question passed without opposition.",
"There has been great stress laid upon this.",
"We look at the subject, not the persons.",
"Why had he not some considerable office?",
"If I had known of such a piece in the whole collection, I should have been angry.",
"It is a most valuable work.",
"She has been stronger ever since, but she suffered more than I was made to.",
"Of that last new face in my vision I could make nothing, save that some one seemed to have painted it over there in the other house.",
"It hurt me to hear his voice break, and I made out to roll near him to help him search.",
"I am sure it is he, for on looking back many things confirm the idea.",
"Nevertheless there are some who try to do so, and their position is as follows.",
"This is what is meant by taking an initiative.",
"Mark to the services of his people.",
"Mark protect his children!",
"Mark, and at that hour.",
"Their route lay across the bridge already named.",
"Mark now presented a novel picture.",
"Is there mark of violence on his body?",
"Mark master here.",
"Mark of his revenue.",
"Mark was empty.",
"Mark, by means of the narrow streets.",
"He took it, and laid it down on the table.",
"So far as I am aware there is no fundamental difference of opinion between the members.",
"God alone can grant success.",
"We went to breakfast.",
"All was quiet, and, after he had done, they separated in a becoming manner.",
"With these persons they met more than once.",
"There was a great mixture of feeling.",
"She had no notion of being carried off by storm in this way.",
"She had noted that he read the papers regularly.",
"There was no need of a glass to mark the effects.",
"She laid her hand upon his.",
"Then he looked up to find the one thing wanting.",
"She looked up at him almost for the first time since her entrance.",
"She came out to him from an inner room almost at once.",
"She was no longer the stronger.",
"Each time I was separated and came back, I just looked at her and I knew.",
"She laid her hand upon his arm.",
"She was not angry, not even hurt.",
"We must find a cook.",
"The dog knew that she must stop in a moment, that no one could pass the falls unless they went over them.",
"I can make a good excuse for wanting an interview with him.",
"Well, as I say, I thought a considerable lot.",
"He laid out everything on the table as he found it.",
"For a mile neither spoke.",
"His sudden appearance surprised her.",
"It was quickly followed by a sense of relief.",
"They returned to the hotel and had breakfast.",
"Its construction will reveal itself.",
"It was probably a means of protection in the days of black magic.",
"I have now, I believe, mentioned all the books which had any considerable effect on my early mental development.",
"For several years from this period, our social studies assumed a shape which contributed very much to my mental progress.",
"I had sought relief again and again from this quarter, but found none.",
"But it serves me right.",
"He is such a mixture.",
"The sort of man who falls in love with every woman he meet.",
"Again she met no one, for those who were down were in at breakfast.",
"It was all my fault!",
"So they were forced to go, because he was stronger than they.",
"They also had but little to say, for they knew themselves in a fault.",
"My breakfast was ready.",
"I am not wanting in good will.",
"The soldiers advanced in close order.",
"Nevertheless, I made an effort.",
"It is the leaders who are wanting.",
"Nevertheless nothing was yet known of what had taken place during the day.",
"Here, in my opinion, the practical side was wanting.",
"He cited me as an example.",
"This man had a roll of paper in his hand.",
"Nevertheless she arrived there.",
"The soldiers sought us with considerable energy.",
"An incident seemed to point to this.",
"I knew him, and I record this incident.",
"Everywhere sudden death.",
"He falls.",
"The following incident happened to her.",
"We separated.",
"They called over the roll.",
"Why are we separated?",
"Let us here mention an incident.",
"There only remains this one, to arrest him.",
"The numbers vary in the official documents.",
"That is what the nations do.",
"This cheese is made daily, and is of the nature of cream cheese, and when fresh is not bad.",
"Either excess is of course wrong.",
"Cold water may be given whenever the child asks for it.",
"Not again that there are wanting men of sense among the same body.",
"They could not bear the thought of having such a number of black persons among them, and particularly as these understood the use of arms.",
"How then can persons in such a state be fit to receive their freedom?",
"Some persons were working at the front door with a key.",
"The hour was not long in coming when his resolution was put to the test.",
"The spot had already grown historic.",
"Nevertheless he was an old man.",
"Their plot was laid too short.",
"This is a point on which too much stress cannot be laid, for there follow from it the most important consequences.",
"They are stronger than I in some way.",
"He sought what relief he could.",
"There is a narrow entrance at the side as well as one through the house.",
"Night falls.",
"With that resolution we returned to court.",
"This incident in my life is not finished.",
"Nor could any one representing him make any claim.",
"Still, he got a few votes.",
"I had known him for a considerable time.",
"I used to have a very good view of all that took place in court, and could tell some very funny as well as interesting stories about persons I have seen.",
"There was no fault whatever to be found with their conduct.",
"Then he stopped, as though a sudden doubt had occurred to him.",
"There were not many people around the main entrance.",
"The bridge had large stone posts where it began.",
"There he stopped, struck by a sudden thought.",
"And with that, he turned back to the inner room.",
"He closed the door carefully behind him and advanced to the middle of the room.",
"They can go hang, for all I care.",
"An elderly woman was talking to me not long ago about her childhood.",
"Indeed, my elderly friend has told me as much.",
"Across it was a bridge.",
"She therefore heard considerable conversation about the plays, and about the persons acting the chief roles in them.",
"I learned that many families were separated.",
"Nevertheless, he would go on, while he could, to the last.",
"The front door had apparently opened and some person or persons came out.",
"Why, it was nearly a mile away already.",
"Much time had, indeed, passed since leaving port.",
"Perhaps she thought he meant to kill her, and in an excess of fear she managed to call out once.",
"How old she felt on a sudden!",
"His true name, or his story, were his to reveal when or where he saw fit.",
"Moreover, one of her charges did not happen to be literally true.",
"How am I going to hang it on them?",
"He laid a hand upon her arm.",
"A storm was rising.",
"In another moment they were out of the warm room and into the storm.",
"He was not angry at her.",
"Not far, in the face of such a storm.",
"By nature she was of the ruling race.",
"Literally, they had to feel their way.",
"He laid it down himself a minute ago.",
"Yet his first feeling was of immediate relief.",
"I could no longer rest with my eyes shut, at peace after the storm.",
"I was afraid that, if I refused to let her come in, she would go to bed angry with me.",
"Each day has been a preparation for the next.",
"He had too much magic in him, however.",
"And they are allowed to go to bed any time they like, or eat chocolate ice cream for breakfast if they wish.",
"Mouse want cheese?",
"He does seem to like to hang around with me a lot.",
"He has missed his mark.",
"Nothing more than a general rule can be laid down.",
"Indeed, where may be its parallel?",
"In this rare quality he has no parallel in any age.",
"He will take a cup of wine from my hands, making me taste it first.",
"There came an awful sound of struggle from the inner room.",
"Many causes contributed to give them this power.",
"She seemed to close the incident.",
"Yes, she said, she had had breakfast.",
"Another thing should be mentioned here also, which is no little fault.",
"Such were the principal persons whom I met with here.",
"Their heads are black and their bodies seem already to have begun to vary in color.",
"She would find fault anyway.",
"All the rest were sold to different persons.",
"This separated me for a time from my wife, for she remained with the family.",
"All the members of the family were very angry.",
"If I could not have gone back, which I could never have done alone, until long after, such changes might have occurred as would have separated us for years, if not forever.",
"The world is more useful to me than I am to the world, but that is not my fault.",
"She also denied him a second cup of chocolate.",
"This morning I hear he had a late breakfast.",
"This man is already under arrest.",
"He turned to her with an air of relief.",
"It is always a great relief to the mind, in moments of trial, to have decided on a course of future action.",
"Well, this gun is finished and painted, and I intended to split it, and have it up this very week.",
"Much ice, much storm, much snow.",
"In order to understand the cause of this sudden change, it will be necessary to return a little, in the order of time.",
"Here they separated.",
"Here the party separated.",
"Mark looked up at his brother.",
"What can be made useful in a household?",
"He knew neither of us and probably forgot the whole incident immediately.",
"I laid hold of the door and spoke in a different tone.",
"But on the other hand I have been unable to confirm them.",
"She asks me to come at once.",
"Which of us has not lived through the magic hours of a magic day?",
"Magic land it must be, for much seeking cannot find it.",
"Above all, why had the telling been a relief?",
"It was a relief, he knew that.",
"They were standing now facing each other.",
"And some one has been angry with it.",
"He is letting her out.",
"After breakfast it would be time to dress for church.",
"Last week when he had told her of his love she had been surprised, sorry and a little angry.",
"Why had the doctor not been attached to one of these?",
"She might be stronger then.",
"My memory serves me with no clear impression of the sequence of events after this period.",
"The chair recognized him and bit into a chocolate.",
"I was a bit upset at being left alone.",
"However, all of a sudden I saw that we should have to act.",
"Personally I believe that they are too few ever to make shooting them popular.",
"I think it is interesting to note that our shooting grounds were the extreme western range of the black bear.",
"No head, however, is of much value as a record unless its history is well known, and unless it has been in the hands of responsible persons.",
"Unique and valuable articles!",
"All breakfast he was turning it over in his mind.",
"A sudden personal interest added itself to the scene.",
"The night before we had had the first real storm of the season.",
"To go by train would be almost too sudden a shock.",
"Roll it along!",
"Then there came into his mind a sudden resolution to speak to them, to tell them who he was, and why and how he was here, and ask them to help him.",
"His good luck had come to him all in a moment so, that it had quite upset him.",
"The train that went through the bridge was the express.",
"If such a thing were to occur, without his fault, against his will and effort, what then?",
"Here was the entrance, and here was the opening, just as it had been left.",
"He reached for it in sudden surprise.",
"A storm.",
"Difference in political principles increased by opposition.",
"There is a valuable numerous collection.",
"He was angry.",
"We had him to breakfast with us.",
"It was still a storm of wind and rain.",
"He agreed in thinking them valuable in families.",
"He did not come to breakfast, but had it sent to him.",
"Some of my friends wanted me to be very angry about this.",
"If more is wanting, more may be found.",
"It seemed to have no other preparation.",
"It then falls into the sea.",
"They are hired from day to day.",
"In one part of the way we had trees on both sides for perhaps half a mile.",
"What a relief!",
"A good thing to give him no further excuse to hang about the place.",
"Unlike other machines, the human body becomes within reasonable limits, stronger and more capable the more it is used.",
"They are also valuable as sources of energy to the body.",
"The normal temperature does not vary with the season.",
"It is often followed by serious and permanent results.",
"Persons who have once suffered in this way should carefully avoid any risk in the future.",
"All such things are valuable helps to the doctor.",
"On the first trial one will probably fall short of the mark, and fail to touch it.",
"He was, in fact, one who was hired to do any piece of work, good or bad.",
"At last a sudden thought struck me.",
"But even here there was for them no permanent place of rest.",
"Mark appear.",
"She had suffered so much that he could not be angry.",
"Let him look on opposition as opportunity.",
"It is the world we had painted and expected.",
"Not without opposition.",
"Well may it be said here, that iron is more valuable than gold.",
"Once she came in from the garden, all upset.",
"If she could, at least, have contributed something toward it!",
"He must have gone nearly a mile, when they heard the sound of a struggle.",
"I was passing one time myself, and they called me in and gave me a cup of tea.",
"They were parallel and perfectly straight, with a direction nearly east and west.",
"Now, my dear, is not this a particular incident, either as I have made it, or as it was designed?",
"I always made it a rule to find fault, whether reasonable or not, that so I might have no reason to find fault.",
"He is angry that I have declined to breakfast with him.",
"I shall be very angry with him.",
"What a surprisingly powerful effect, so much and so long in my power she!",
"What a good breakfast that was, and how fast the little old woman talked!",
"Come sit near the window where the light is stronger.",
"For there was magic in the day.",
"They did not want to wait for breakfast.",
"Mark what I say!",
"For the first time for many days she felt a desire for food, and raising herself partly up, called to her mother to get her breakfast.",
"He seemed to be finding fault with himself.",
"She did not eat any breakfast.",
"Hang, copies!",
"Arrest him, officers.",
"A mess of my good friends!",
"I grant.",
"Mark the end.",
"She is but weak, and he is the stronger.",
"With these words he advanced to the door of the little room and opened it.",
"But I was quickly brought back by the cook.",
"Grant gave them credit for everything else.",
"Grant asked her to dinner.",
"Now he had got the magic skin.",
"Then, with a sudden cry, he looked at the frame.",
"It was this which had made them angry against me.",
"A feeling of relief came upon them both.",
"He was upset, and ran away from the house.",
"I do now know the reason of many things, and I cannot be angry when we are going away from each other.",
"This made him very angry.",
"Near this lake, in this very country, lies a water held in a cup, not round but square.",
"This must not happen again while we are partners.",
"She seemed to hang upon him.",
"Of course it had been an expert.",
"Loves me?",
"And if they should pass the bridge first, what then?",
"For that is the way a woman feels when she loves a man and he has hurt her feelings.",
"She laid her cool hand on top of them.",
"But she was not angry with him.",
"I expect that he has a different identity for every place which he visits.",
"The more valuable a man is to me, the more I watch him, for he might be even more valuable to somebody else.",
"She loves life, and this, perhaps, is why life loves her.",
"If he does not himself cross, arrest him as soon as his boat has gone.",
"If he does go, watch for his return and arrest him, and his boat and all on board, the moment that they return.",
"There is, of course, a considerable body of evidence, and it all seems to point one way.",
"Nor can it be said that all of them advanced science.",
"He must neither eat nor drink to excess.",
"He painted men and things as they appeared.",
"From that time a great progress has been seen among the nations.",
"One elderly man went fairly wild during the business.",
"A capital library is attached to the schools.",
"Not frozen.",
"Should not be too sudden.",
"The most proper season for giving the child this preparation, is immediately after it has been nursing.",
"Nature never intended anything stronger than water to be the drink for children.",
"But this is an excess which is not required.",
"That the thing may be carried to excess, I have no doubt.",
"There may be excess, even in this.",
"Unlike them he put no mark on it, but studied it carefully and passed it so often that he could not possibly mistake it.",
"And nevertheless it was done.",
"There was nothing of high mark in this.",
"The mother laid her work upon the table, and put her hand up to her face.",
"She did not open the case, to the relief of her friend.",
"But neither nations nor individuals are great in everything.",
"Their entrance was always from the west or the east.",
"Would such a love have been permanent?",
"Hang this thinking, at last!",
"Though he worked regularly at his business, work seemed turned to play when he took it in hand.",
"Then they separated.",
"Physical health is a necessary condition of all permanent success.",
"He attached himself closely to neither party.",

"From this small beginning there has been developed the present engineering, experimental and research department which is under my charge.",
"But whatever was wanting in the public services, the social meetings of the day were a great success.",
"His visits to his family were few, and the year was one of most severe labor.",
"He was a man of mark.",
"First, all that could possibly manage to get through the year without aid must be struck off the list, and then such as remain will need to be cut down to the lowest possible figure.",
"Referring to this good brother brings up an incident of the meeting.",
"It is not his fault that he is generally popular.",
"At this time I was also employed to do considerable work in connection with the press.",
"It asks nor offers quarter.",
"It certainly is a study in black, without any relief whatever.",
"The people are not adjusted to the strange vehicle.",
"She must go at once, or she may be missed by her household.",
"Her inner life is with the past.",
"He had seen her rise, and it was a great relief to him.",
"At the same time, I am ready to grant that all cannot accept my views.",
"On a sudden it came over him.",
"It had been necessary to trust many persons.",
"There is a ruling power.",
"Gone with the storm!",
"He stands facing the window.",
"And it has the greatest bridge over the greatest river in the world.",
"Roll on!",
"All laid down their arms.",
"All night the people were employed in saving their persons and effects.",
"Nevertheless, look here!",
"Who are those persons, it is again asked?",
"Nevertheless they were very kind to her.",
"The lake is about a mile, or a mile and a half, long, and half a mile broad.",
"A considerable number every year do not.",
"The ground is frozen, too.",
"Mark, too, the importance of man in the book.",
"Nevertheless, he was not decided, and could not quite decide.",
"The morning passed away and nothing was advanced one single step.",
"At last the storm broke.",
"There was a mark on it.",
"He did not go to the house direct, but went round it, and walked about, and at last found himself on the bridge.",
"The mother sat up with her at night, and a poor woman half a mile off came in during the day and saw that things went all straight.",
"He is not like any one of those persons, and he never will be in any one of those situations.",
"Both cases were well advanced because the man had been on the outside and had not been treated.",
"We knew it contained the port doctor.",
"He was sick and tired of medicine, and he was sick and tired of persons.",
"I hit the mark.",
"But I altered the course and ran along parallel with the coast.",
"The cook is gone.",
"Are we stronger than he?",
"He who loves his wife loves himself.",
"See the place where they laid him.",
"To his own master he stands or falls.",
"He never laid hand on me.",
"Here is something stronger than life, stronger than woman, but what is it?",
"Yet his house was not painted.",
"To this day his house is not painted, as everybody knows.",
"And it is all wood, and always has been well painted.",
"But the incident served me well.",
"It is the stuff of the painted pictures of marriage.",
"That which I see is not a thing or a person, but nevertheless what I feel towards it can be called by no other name than love.",

["This belief was well founded.",
"Not granted.",
"It grew upon my sight.",
"I felt almost as though I would welcome the sight of it.",
"It was horrible.",
"It was a strange sight.",
"Then, suddenly, a fresh thing came to my sight.",
"It was lying on its right side, its back turned toward me.",
"That it had stood through all the years was, it seemed to me, proof that it was something different from any other house.",
"I discovered, now, that the speed of time had become enormous.",
"Save in its enormous size, I could find nothing unlike.",
"Now that I am writing, let me record that I am certain, there is something horrible about to happen.",
"A horrible fear has come to me.",
"It seemed very long, was really only a few seconds, but I was getting rather nervous when suddenly a child ran across the garden.",
"It took me about a week to get really settled.",
"His horse put his foot in a hole and fell with him.",
"It looked a bad accident, as if the horse were going to roll over on him.",
"The contrast was striking.",
"Do the stars in their courses lay limitations on free will?",
"It is this wish for growth, for the development of our powers, for a larger life for ourselves and for those who shall come after us.",
"What can I think that shall be worth the consideration of the race?",
"Where shall we put our moral powers?",
"Such is the power of control that is granted to each new soul.",
"I will establish honest laws of trade.",
"From others he must take something for granted.",
"Language is electric.",
"The higher the honor, the harder the work.",
"How striking the contrast!",
"I am now the wife of another, and it is our duty to forget all that is past.",
"I was very nervous for a long time after this.",
"Had she no trust in my good sense or honor?",
"It has made me nervous.",
"The affair interested me greatly.",
"They settled themselves.",
"His practical knowledge was enormous.",
"They proposed at once a tour into the interior.",
"Each suspected the other of doing less than he should.",
"I cannot doubt, that had the affair come to a focus, I should have warned the scientists even at the risk of my life.",
"The sight finished me.",
"Told him the danger was over.",
"He took it for granted.",
"The sight of these settled the matter.",
"We found them, and it was settled that they should go with us for a month among the mountains.",
"I looked into the yard as I came along, and saw a dead dog lying there.",
"Men are destroyed by accident, and their lives are sometimes saved by it.",
"That engine is the human mind.",
"Breakfast of bread and tea was soon made.",
"A few minutes later I caught sight of a dozen more in one band, near the foot of the upper fall.",
"Are such statements as these to be submitted to by a man of honor?",
"The promised advantage might be great or small, but whatever it was, it would be most welcome.",
"And the honor, too!",
"He said that we had been for some time in a state of peace, and our expenses were not so large as they had been.",
"They were too tired to bother themselves about the view.",
"He feels proud of the fact.",
"We drove rapidly round to the entrance door, and a moment later I found myself in the presence of my host and patient.",
"I struck a light and began to examine the interior with care.",
"The following is no doubt but one of many similar experiences.",
"In a word, he was honest.",
"The result of this consideration was the obvious one.",
"What I am doing is my duty.",
"On consideration he saw that there was still hope.",
"It did not take long to find a place and get settled.",
"Then there is that horrible drinking.",
"They did not want to bother taking care of them so they killed them.",
"He carried on his head a box filled with tea, sugar, and bread.",
"They promised him many things.",
"The chief there had promised to help.",
"Those who are innocent will not be hurt.",
"They are innocent.",
"Sometimes it became very exciting.",
"She was a very fair and honest judge.",
"It is all horrible.",
"As yet there is no dog in sight.",
"Occasionally he would be called on for a public speech, and for several days he would be busy at his desk.",
"We apply ourselves.",
"Rather, I think that he was taking an hour from the routine of the day.",
"They were proud of the confidence placed in them, and were ready to go anywhere and do anything.",
"They saw him land, and he was then lost to sight.",
"Broke a piece of bread.",
"Bother him!",
"The second half of the game proved, if anything, more exciting than the first.",
"I heard some one in the passage.",
"The above work should have a place in every public library in this country, as also in the libraries of public schools and private houses.",
"Players when away from their home grounds, in a fall series, are more or less under a nervous strain.",
"That settled, they sat down to dinner.",
"Striking a match I looked round.",
"He took the horse and returned immediately.",
"When half a mile away, the horse started for camp at the top of his speed.",
"He promised everything that she asked.",
"They did not know whether to jump out or remain in the coach.",
"My greatest danger was that my horse might run into a hole and fall down, and in this way get away from me.",
"They had learned of my experiences of the previous day, and asked me if I did not think it would be a dangerous trip.",
"Of course everybody was now talking horse.",
"And love a simple duty.",
"The initial consideration was that of extent.",
"But I have faced much more terrible things.",
"What great things have we done for ourselves!",
"It was settled, then.",
"The expenses are very heavy.",
"She turned and faced the crowd.",
"How can they, when their lives are all duty?",
"Our friends, if they really love us, want most of all what we can give them of ourselves.",
"But the letters must be destroyed.",
"He was lying as still as a mouse.",
"It was horrible to turn.",
"It was pretty horrible.",
"A little laugh at their expense went round the room.",
"I do, thin.",
"But the incident had left him nervous.",
"I should be sure to yield.",
"Is that so certain a proof?",
"She faced him.",
"I think no people ever met the sorry problem that we faced.",
"I really had no idea what that desk contained.",
"She was proud of him, the strong animal.",
"Experiments depend upon circumstances and upon the age of the children.",
"And the children are greatly attached to their school.",
"These are examples of what a town park might yield.",
"It would appear that this part of the lake requires some improvement to make it in keeping with the rest of the water system with which it is connected.",
"Islands are numerous, so much so that there are very few parts of the river where there are not one or more in sight.",
"They were ready to do their duty.",
"Of course that settled it.",
"What had I to offer for the heart of that proud lady?",
"I said that I knew too little of the sport to be of much weight as a witness.",
"The sight of that simple thing fairly brought my heart to my mouth.",
"This sounds simple enough, but the danger lay in the second party.",
"The thought of the horse worried me.",
"The sight of that little camp is still in my memory.",
"Maybe my news would make all the differ.",
"Then another horrible thought struck her.",
"The child is very nervous and sensitive.",
"The sight was wonderful, and terrible beyond description.",
"The eyes that looked in upon me had powers beyond my powers.",
"It began to have an interest, an exciting hold upon me, which I could not describe.",
"I did not make it very successfully.",
"I do my duty on my side, and I expect it from others.",
"In fact, I know her by sight.",
"Do double offices differ specifically from each other?",
"The next morning they drove to town again, passing slowly up the street of the little village to examine each building that might be a possible location for a newspaper office.",
"And I can take all the day messages, too.",
"The results are very striking.",
"Not a line of routine has been changed in the house.",
"If we had done our duty this would never have happened.",
"The sight was enough.",
"He was lying on his back, his head on a line with his body.",
"She settled back in her place and took out a book, looking over the top at him from time to time.",
"Then there was a sound of flying feet in the wide passage.",
"Now, the boy again, that danger was gone.",
"But he is in constant danger.",
"This had been taken into consideration long before.",
"The lines that tied them were long.",
"He is in danger.",
"Are we in danger here?",
"Now, when it was too late, she convinced herself that he was innocent.",
"She drove at once to the hotel.",
"It was too late to follow up the discovery that night.",
"They believed that the greater such power, the greater the danger of its abuse.",
"Of this, the world war was in itself a proof.",
"When she faced the crowd it stopped again.",
"Too proud to do it.",
"The horse stopped.",
"There will be no danger.",
"He knew how to jump very well.",
"The dogs drove her into a hole.",
"He found her lying down.",
"They did not think of danger.",
"That helped to pay the expenses.",
"But he kept out of her sight.",
"The men thought that he would jump off into the water.",
"He was getting ready to jump into the water.",
"A big dog was lying on the step.",
"If his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?",
"If we are to see anything of their family life, it must be through effort we ourselves put forth.",
"What a beautiful literary household it is!",
"Which is the more literary?",
"We ourselves use them.",
"My father sent a man and horse after me.",
"Yet she had promised to take it and must make good.",
"Indeed, he rather thought she had meant to jump off had they not run on to the bridge.",
"I think she meant to jump off, although we were going fast.",
"They were directors of the line and did not look happy.",
"He took her down some iron steps and to a door in a dark passage.",
"Then he picked up some papers on his desk.",
"Expenses were heavy and it was important they should not lose a day.",
"It was obvious that he did not bother about his clothes.",
"He had never heard of this phenomenon before.",
"But his life shows how this belief isolated him.",
"I tried to keep him in sight.",
"I could not send it to him without exciting question.",
"I went home, my latest duty done.",
"It is a separate creation, equally wonderful with the master, but not human.",
"There is no doubt that our men at least are faced toward the future.",
"It is essential that we raise money to carry on the other expenses.",
"I felt myself flying up through the water and then I shot into the air.",
"The trouble had started in the engine room.",
"It was wide open, and revealed an empty passage.",
"Was he connected with the crime?",
"I drove on, but I kept my eye on him, though I had my back to him.",
"But the feeling that kept running through my head was that both of us would be suspected of the murder.",
"The police have too many things against me for my word to be any good as a witness.",
"The man at the desk started up, and turned round.",
"I am greatly interested.",
"Had a shot been fired witness could not have failed to hear it.",
"Then there came a crash, followed by the sound of flying feet.",
"I had no reason to think that I was being sought, or that my presence in this building was even suspected.",
"Every one knew my horse.",
"Some new discovery on their part?",
"I have a theory that a most important witness in the same, drove by here at the hour and on the night I have named.",
"But there was one point to be settled first.",
"He was many hours on the route and had many new experiences with human nature.",
"Not one was in sight.",
"Honest at the core.",
"That witness is myself.",
"But I know who drove that horse.",
"She grew very nervous.",
"I mean, proud of.",
"She started at sight of them.",
"All that she asked I promised.",
"The thought drove me to the table.",
"As I came within sight of the house I grew suddenly strong again.",
"At the next moment he was half way around a corner, and in another, out of sight.",
"The usual routine was gone through.",
"I suspected her trouble, and was ready to stand by her, if a man like me could do anything.",
"It was the first time she had ever asked me to do anything for her which any one else might not have done, and I was proud of her confidence, and happy to do just what she asked.",
"She lay heavily on him, but he did not lose his hold.",
"But I shall have proof.",
"It is possible that at times there are moments of humor in the lives of animals.",
"She did not require sight to find it.",
"It was on this day that she made a discovery.",
"He faced the direction of the wind.",
"The only thing in our favor was that the night promised to be dark.",
"That is the story as has been set down by others, and I have already told what we ourselves saw.",
"Thus the matter was settled.",
"Another moment passed, in which the air seemed filled with the promise of an electric storm.",
"Now, that would be a sight worth seeing!",
"Some days before when opening the desk, I had broken the glass of my watch, which I held in my hand, and the fragments fell among the papers.",
"These being laid upon a table, and tied so as to be unable to move, the operation was performed in the manner before described.",
"We ourselves do not quite understand what is happening around us.",
"They are a danger too.",
"And what are the reasons alleged for this decision?",
"From a sense of duty I have also assumed all responsibility.",
"On what does it depend?",
"They had few losses in men, and a great development in wealth.",
"Must we fall out ourselves?",
"Before the sun went down he knew and could read at sight at least a dozen words.",
"However, as I said, before the day was over, he knew at least a dozen words perfectly well at sight.",
"Though I were certain he would kill me, I could not draw back in honor.",
"We have already settled all that.",
"She believes it her duty, and will allow no one else to enter.",
"The life of a horse is valuable, but that of a man is more so.",
"During the day, I saw but little of the other members of the family, and was left greatly to my own resources.",
"When he was out of sight, I turned back to join my company, and I felt that I had made a new friend, and one whom I was proud to have.",
"I could see him giving an order, when his horse was hit and he barely saved himself from falling under it.",
"I have forgot what right and justice and honor were.",
"There was no real danger.",
"A pool of blood revealed the entrance to the passage.",
"It is simply to fight these powers of evil that we are out.",
"And that by itself is a sufficient, and the most honest, reason.",
"To keep them up to this high standard of efficiency they need a high standard of care and consideration.",
"And it is in this very fact that its great moral and social danger to the community lies.",
"They are too thin.",
"The fact is sad, but it must be faced.",
"It was enormous.",
"The first phase of the operations having thus ended successfully quite early in the day, the second stage was entered upon.",
"Fear of death does not exist for the man who has led a good and honest life.",
"At length, losing all fear and fired with the sight of many new and pretty things he found while following it, he ran along the banks until, miles from home, he came to a great lake he could hardly see across, it was so broad.",
"Thus running he came at last out of the passage to an open room or space so wide that, look which way he would, he could see no end to it.",
"I had given him my card, and told him with whom I was staying.",
"We knew ourselves to be in the center of the wood, but that was all.",
"It was a great shock to me to find her lying there dead.",
"He had changed his clothes, and presented such a different appearance that at first sight I failed to recognize him.",
"She had, however, never suspected the truth until I pointed it out to her.",
"And ourselves!",
"Once his horse was shot under him.",
"He was also master of the horse.",
"The belief in the murder appears to have been general.",
"They differ in no way from the others, only that they wear long hair like the women.",
"I am bringing with me men of this island and of the others that I have seen, who give proof of the things that I have described.",
"Being greatly afraid they gave everything up to him.",
"We were very much afraid of it, and the sight of it caused us to return immediately to the sea.",
"I asked if he could order any transport to be provided for us.",
"We missed him greatly.",
"It was also supposed to be gas proof, but was not.",
"And the others had not been proof against our gas.",
"But what a sight this road presented!",
"We were proud of our town.",
"We both were proud.",
"He turned and faced me.",
"Then he turned again slowly, and half faced me.",
"My father turned to quiet his horse.",
"I half suspected that he had not, but I never knew.",
"That is all, an exciting little game.",
"Grant had just come into sight at its foot.",
"Why, if he is innocent?",
"He felt that, for once, the general opinion was with him, and drove the point home.",
"His written words had the same honest ring.",
"She turned and faced him.",
"In fact, he hardly ever did make any record in a case unless it was essential to prove the exact words of a suspected person.",
"But each of us must do his duty.",
"Mountain to bear out her belief.",
"She determined to get free from the prison in which she found herself, and now began to act for herself, and for the first time to make connected plans for the future.",
"He would have new clothes, she had promised them to him.",
"Danger now remained on the north.",
"It was an exciting game.",
"Put men on board who can work their own way over, and who, as soon as they land, can do duty as regular troops.",
"They said that the scene of action certainly was changed, but not the danger.",
"He at once accepted the dangerous honor.",
"And this, my dear friends, brings us to the very root of the meaning of law.",
"And what is our duty in them?",
"He has given us feelings and powers.",
"It is as it were the root lie of all lies.",
"So to begin at the root of this.",
"Let him go where the officers lead him, and do his own duty.",
"Let him take that, too, as it comes, and do his duty.",
"So we shall gain at least the sight of an ideal man.",
"We are ready enough, most of us, to waste upon ourselves.",
"The owner and his household are in daily danger.",
"I come short daily of my own low standard of duty.",
"This is a striking instance, but only one of many.",
"In these days there is not an honest man to be met with.",
"Some day we may need help ourselves.",
"He was a little man and quite thin.",
"I was in danger of making myself too happy.",
"Such an impression I never received from objects of sight before, nor do I suppose that I can ever again.",
"Is life, with such limitations, worth trying?",
"But I am in too light a humor to touch these matters.",
"We think ourselves most lucky.",
"I am out of the literary world at present.",
"The rain had been falling heavily through the night.",
"In only a couple of days, the green of the city was in sight.",
"But she looked like a fine white horse.",
"Only then did he realize that this was no normal horse that was speaking to him.",
"The sight that met his eyes was hardly what he would have expected.",
"Once inside, she was met with a sight that made her more angry than ever.",
"It was their duty.",
"Was it not a proof of their confidence in him?",
"It is more important, however, to notice that, though the revenue was rising, expenses were increasing still faster.",
"Let this be granted.",
"It is only the principle I wish settled now.",
"The losses were heavy.",
"It has the place of honor.",
"I lived in this belief, and am now about to die in it.",
"This was a form of literary work not much used in those days.",
"This was her last literary effort.",
"Its powers, always so great, seemed to be greater than ever.",
"The next year was marked by other trying losses.",
"But nothing could keep her back from what she felt to be the post of duty.",
"What the world would think was a light consideration with her.",
"There is no flying hence, nor staying here.",
"When we thought ourselves quite perfect in our several parts, we announced it for representation.",
"I was so happy and so proud.",
"The horse was standing over them.",
"This horse of mine is tired.",
"I have the strength of a horse.",
"We have, however, little to do with such matters here, except in so far as they affect the persons connected with this record.",
"We are here to enjoy ourselves and found a hospital.",
"Believe me, I feel the honor deeply.",
"The thought is too horrible.",
"There lay the danger, and they both knew it.",
"She is not nervous in that way.",
"She was in a dangerous humor.",
"I am suspected.",
"There was no one in sight.",
"He knew that he was in danger.",
"His hands fell heavily on the table.",
"He never thinks of the danger.",
"But he wants us to do it all ourselves.",
"Inside the contrast with the older day was even more striking.",
"It was a settled people.",
"The proof of that is easy.",
"Yet he knew he had made no great discovery.",
"Come, ride back with me, and we shall meet her still, depend on it.",
"This discovery was sufficient.",
"The others were always waiting for this, and glad of it and proud of her, for they knew what was going to happen, because they had had experience.",
"This is an operation requiring considerable experience.",
"Keep them in paper bags, which hang in a dry place.",
"The bread is made in the evening.",
"It may be observed, in general, that there should always be flowers on the table, and as they form no item of expense, there is no reason why they should not be employed every day.",
"In either case, this exciting cause of the disease must be at once stopped.",
"There is no danger in this, provided the person who does it has not got the skin taken off any part of his mouth.",
"Should the accident occur at a great distance from any house, this treatment should be adopted as closely as the circumstances will permit of.",
"Off we drove.",
"Talk about military duty!",
"We had looked forward to the settled summer weather for a marked improvement in his health.",
"And this brings us to the problem which gave birth to the present essay.",
"What is a horse?",
"Where such evidence exists it must be faced, and at least its existence must be explained.",
"As long as his mother knew about the matter he did not need to bother any more.",
"Then he would see that she was innocent.",
"No living man could be as enormous as that.",
"After that everything was settled.",
"I know why he looked that way and why he was so enormous.",
"Under his protection she could face every danger.",
"So it was settled that every child should have their mother alone for an hour, and they were to take their turns according to age.",
"The pressure lay on them all very heavily.",
"I promised to go to see him soon again and to bring him a picture book.",
"I said, I think, that I was promised help.",
"Field thought it proper to accept such honor.",
"Nearly every one of them claimed to be innocent of the crimes charged to them.",
"This engine was little improved until the early part of the last century.",
"At this fire a large number of frame buildings on the opposite side of the street were destroyed.",
"After he had been at work a short time they discovered that he would be able to set up all the type he had distributed and probably more, too.",
"To strike down such a man at such a time was indeed a crime most horrible.",
"Here is a fit partner for a league of honor.",
"Honor to them!",
"He gave a nervous start.",
"She caught sight of her husband, then stopped.",
"Our work here has been hard and exciting and always working in any kind of weather.",
"Our losses are severe.",
"Our duty is quite clear.",
"It promised to be a hot day.",
"And then came a new sight.",
"We get so tired that we cannot ride a horse, even at a walk.",
"The sight was terrible and horrible beyond words.",
"I speak of vast losses.",
"Not a second has passed but my life has been in danger, and yet not a hair of my head has been hurt.",
"The losses on both sides have been enormous.",
"The losses on both sides were enormous.",
"It was truly horrible.",
"Among these the losses were heavy.",
"Many of them pay their own expenses.",
"I yield me!",
"But what a sight was that which they saw!",
"First, be more honest.",
"Truly, there is no danger in this.",
"The surprise is that the discovery should have come so late.",
"Here is the passage in the work itself.",
"I promised the doctor I would not take tea.",
"I looked out into the night, and there I saw new cause for danger.",
"A few more minutes, and they would have destroyed the bridge.",
"The whole system was connected with military service.",
"It must be settled one way or the other.",
"The danger is all the other way.",
"We have found ourselves, and we have found our friends.",
"But all these things, from a distance, are now seen to have been the broken water that follows the passage of a great storm.",
"We have found ourselves.",
"And it has put an end to another danger.",
"We depend for our strength on what we hold in common.",
"He does not much respect the institutions of a town.",
"Differ, difference.",
"So much did they differ from each other.",
"Why in the world do we not ourselves do the same?",
"Everybody suspected those people.",
"The rest also who had shared in the plot against him were all except a very few destroyed, some previously, some at this time, and some subsequently.",
"This is what they granted him directly after the victory.",
"The same rule applied to the tea and the bread.",
"We have just time to look at the address, place them in the proper box, and touch the spring which sets the electric current at work.",
"I noted, however, that many fish apparently valuable were among those thus rejected.",
"Their average increase is to be destroyed each year.",
"But as soon as she saw me she put it out of sight.",
"Their share is settled and is not increased.",
"I have no proof against the only man who, to my knowledge, can desire my death.",
"We will limit ourselves to a single instance.",
"But what a sight!",
"Everybody is lying flat on the ground.",
"Humor him.",
"He must do much and live greatly in little time.",
"But the effect was striking.",
"Meanwhile the danger to us is at hand.",
"Bread was the staff of life.",
"There was not a person in sight nor a sound to be heard.",
"She appeared to be close upon further discovery.",
"But it promised only in case of rain.",
"He got out to examine the engine.",
"He turned on the electric light.",
"He watched the big car until it was out of sight.",
"He felt belief in his luck.",
"And he did not pull the horse too soon.",
"He was glad to have this proof.",
"She was not proof against the strong, warm pressure of his hand.",
"The one great thing she could do was to show him that she would not stand in the way of his duty to himself.",
"I go on duty.",
"How horrible!",
"But they are not greatly to blame, because so many girls throw themselves at their heads.",
"Not until late in the afternoon, however, did off duty present an opportunity for him to go into the village.",
"But he knew what his duty was, and as soon as he could move he began to edge along the short beat.",
"Duty and hate forced me.",
"That question never was settled.",
"He generally kept a horse.",
"There was a good deal of social and literary life.",
"Most of them were destroyed long ago.",
"Besides myself there was another of the party to whom a dying friend had promised to return, if possible, but had not come.",
"If there is no regular mail at the place of discovery, the first opportunity of any other kind must be made use of, without waiting for other observations.",
"My only purpose is truth, and my only witness history.",
"Experiences have been many since then, yet I recall, as though it were but yesterday, the faces of those who walked in line with me.",
"I did know it, yet somehow had never connected the fact before directly with my own case.",
"Anyway when he found us there, he was not in good humor.",
"He would recognize me at sight.",
"Thus far I had successfully passed the test, and been accepted by all on board.",
"In that hour I knew she was more to me than life, or even honor.",
"Keep him in sight.",
"Nor was I greatly afraid of the result at present.",
"Such service to another would have been a duty, and no more.",
"Anyway I shall see to it that they do their duty.",
"There is no use giving up until we know what the danger is.",
"The light was sufficient to reveal most of the interior.",
"When my eyes opened, I saw a sight that I shall never forget.",
"Well, if there is one thing I am proud of, it is that I have always been good.",
"He was sorry that he had promised to stay to lunch.",
"He took it for granted that she would know that he would come.",
"And that it looked like love at first sight to her.",
"Nor did she greatly care.",
"That was one consideration.",
"Here was a second consideration.",
"When he came back she was lying on her bed, her face from the light.",
"No one else in sight!",
"It was like flying!",
"This being admitted, let us consider what the things are which are connected.",
"They work out these things in the personal equation largely.",
"Besides, there is sometimes a point of honor in these things.",
"But then he is a horse that thinks!",
"The ice is thin near there.",
"He came over and turned her head around until she faced him.",
"It seemed that she ought to be proud of them, and she was!",
"I was proud, too, and I left money to pay for the time I had been with them.",
"I wish it could have been settled without this.",
"On coming out she saw her son lying on the ground.",
"I had never seen anything like this before, and my wonder at it almost drove the pain away.",
"After a time we began to know the names of different articles, and where they were kept, and could get them ourselves.",
"The wall was too high for me to jump.",
"By this time our engine had arrived.",
"It was the horse stable.",
"If a horse has got a serious trouble, get a good horse doctor, say I.",
"He would tell the horse story first.",
"At that moment the horse came running up, and stood by his master.",
"The operation always interests him greatly, and he usually starts.",
"He has a great stock of horse stories, and I am almost as bad.",
"A horse has a long memory.",
"Father said very good, but put the horse in first.",
"There had been a horse.",
"He intended me to come here and find every animal lying dead.",
"Man is a god to the lower creation.",
"We soon settled down for the winter.",
"I was glad for the horse.",
"He was one of those men for whom danger appears to stand aside.",
"They even settled down toward his southern side.",
"He beat the desk.",
"But if we say the latter, we must allow a change in the shape of the land which is enormous.",
"Now what proof is there of that?",
"What caused the striking difference?",
"But what proof is there of this?",
"That seems to have settled the question.",
"Does any reader wish for proof of this?",
"But they differ in the site of their control.",
"It involves memory and association of experiences.",
"In short, we think and feel with each and every part of ourselves.",
"He did not seem in a humor to trust himself to speech.",
"It had been a most exciting experience, however.",
"But there was no one in sight.",
"Peace is the business of the great powers primarily.",
"Whether that joint control comes through arms or through the law is a secondary consideration.",
"It makes us more dependent upon them, as a very little consideration will show.",
"This war has only begun to be horrible.",
"They have time and energy to capture it, because they have no other interest in life except that.",
"The second votes on their voting papers are treated as whole votes and distributed up the list, and so on.",
"Out of debt out of danger.",
"In his eyes every one had an equal claim to consideration and justice.",
"Let us ourselves decide the day.",
"His face was all thin on account of his not being very strong and he never had much food until he got in with us, either.",
"Because all the while I knew where that key came from, and it seemed just like lying not to tell.",
"And, honest, I could hardly speak to him.",
"Nothing however would content him but a sight of the lady.",
"I will never permit it.",
"And here comes a pilot boat with a signal flying.",
"To her surprise, the horse did not stop.",
"Not that she suspected any such thing.",
"Tied up safe.",
"Extremely honest.",
"We are not like ourselves, at present.",
"We are all in danger.",
"Staying alone all night was nothing compared to this.",
"Not that this sight had been so long familiar, for her father was ever seeking new places along the coast to rest in, or grow strong in.",
"The finding of the box with his name on it seemed to be proof positive against him.",
"To play a joke is one thing, to blame it on a fellow student who is innocent is another.",
"Keep them on the jump.",
"We have seen a sad sight.",
"That is my belief.",
"We have not the least proof, and, what is more, never shall or can have, that he did not write them.",
"They take it for granted.",
"There was no danger of being seen.",
"Indeed, they seemed meant for each other, this horse and this man.",
"So it was settled.",
"If he could have destroyed them as we do now, it is not for us to say that he would have been wrong.",
"That way danger lay.",
"She assumed the city must have changed greatly.",
"He knew that she was lying.",
"He ran down the road and was soon out of sight.",
"Pass me the bread!",
"Subsequently, however, my views became modified.",
"However, my duty to the country is done.",
"He looks as though he had never felt in a good humor in his life.",
"He on his side certainly placed no confidence in this big dark girl with a head like that of a horse, who, it seemed to him, knew far too much.",
"But women are always so nervous.",
"But at heart the matter greatly worried him.",
"Buy an engine!",
"He was proud of it.",
"She was moved, almost surprised at the sight of them, as if they had acquired some new and particular meaning.",
"Why I had gone down the passage.",
"From the day of that wedding the government of the farm was finally settled.",
"All our work is destroyed.",
"Thus the affair was settled.",
"Were any or all of them aggressive?",
"It is their business and their duty.",
"But that choice does not depend merely on the issue of the war.",
"What, shall we yield for this religious fear?",
"I care not greatly.",
"Out of my sight, out of my sight, I say!",
"What, shall I think her hate will yield so much?",
"Hence, further from my sight!",
"There is no exception to the rule that if a man drink heavily at night the next morning will show the other side to his nature.",
"My life is in danger.",
"But now he was promised a pair of shoes that would be sure to fit.",
"Honest as the day is long about every thing else.",
"That body would never yield.",
"All is lost for us except honor.",
"The fact that it was still summer when we recorded this temperature warned us to see that our equipment was in good condition.",
"After we had seen to the wants of the dogs we could then think of ourselves.",
"This settled the matter.",
"The feeling that the country was in danger helped both sides to be of one mind.",
"His directors wanted him to make a record.",
"Does the public deal with that president and that board of directors?",
"It is therefore distributed over the year and adjusted to the flow of income as it comes in.",
"But they would yield on nothing else.",
"Honor where honor is due!",
"He perhaps had a sense of duty.",
"He is honest.",
"And they take it for granted that the religious life is the only possible one.",
"She was thinking these thoughts as she drove through the little mountain village.",
"It is a small, square apartment at the end of a long and dark passage.",
"She thought, or she was made to think, that her duty lay in another direction.",
"She promised, and she has kept her word.",
"We know one another at first sight.",
"The coach drove off.",
"They must account to me for these things, which I miss so greatly.",
"It was being admitted to a sight of the past.",
"We were not without our literary talk either.",
"Where was the quiet, where the promised rest?",
"Every morning a bit of dry bread and some bad small beer.",
"I have not found the passage.",
"See next essay.",
"There has been some discussion as to the origin of the central idea of this essay.",
"But this was long after the present essay was written.",
"For explanation of this title see note to the essay that follows.",
"That was the present essay.",
"We found ourselves much more comfortable here than in the city.",
"If not, may I ask, in what respect have I passed these limitations?",
"I was a bit nervous but was determined to manage somehow.",
"The bags should then be moved to another room.",
"Each one had a separate desk to work and when I came I was also given my own desk and chair.",
"A year had gone by since I had finished school and what an exciting year it had been.",
"Before such a judge, a very little proof would be sufficient.",
"They have been since lost, and the discovery, which comparison of writing might have made, is now no longer possible.",
"The nation looked on with little care, because there did not seem to be much danger.",
"From this moment, the whole nation can witness, that no time was lost.",
"While they are innocent they are safe.",
"But if we will permit them to tax themselves, they will give us more than we require.",
"His opinion is, that our gain from them will be the same, and our expense less.",
"Debate on taking the state of the army into consideration.",
"The charge, if it is just, must be, by its own nature, easily proved, and that no proof is brought may, perhaps, be sufficient to make us suspect that it is not just.",
"I shall not think it my duty to return any answer.",
"For he that is called as a witness where he is interested, is in reality giving evidence in his own cause.",
"Let us all fit ourselves for it.",
"When I am settled, I shall write again.",
"Let us think seriously on our duty.",
"It was natural therefore that they should be selected for this legal fiction.",
"Shall I ever be able to bear the sight of this stone?",
"It was this last that kept him thin.",
"It was not in the nature of the business that they should lead honest lives.",
"Suddenly I knew that honor was not in me.",
"They drove away.",
"Yet it is wonderful how perfectly she finds her way without the aid of sight.",
"She could not help looking in, at the risk of discovery.",
"Then he settled back into his chair again.",
"A little consideration will show us that it is.",
"This is a fundamental truth which should never be lost sight of.",
"Now this is exactly the case with ourselves.",
"It seems at first sight a strange country to which to send these men from the north, but in fact it was a very happy choice.",
"They have not yet destroyed him.",
"Mark, still flying with all their force.",
"The case before us was in proof of the truth of what has here been said.",
"This was the duty of his parents, and should have been their task.",
"I wish I could agree with them in their belief about themselves.",
"What a sight!",
"The only limitations are those which a people may place over themselves.",
"But they rejected it, and therefore we were absolutely free.",
"How often did he not put his life in danger?",
"The latter merely destroyed a few bodies but the others tried to kill the soul of a nation.",
"I hope that the students will do their duty.",
"The result was that both the proposals went by the board and the expected has happened.",
"The only consideration, that can at the present moment keep them in office must be service of the country.",
"And the promise that is behind this performance of duty, the promise given by every religion that I have studied is sure and certain.",
"Important institutions may any day become truly national.",
"This happens in everyday life.",
"I have felt it this morning that I would have failed in my duty if I did not say all what I said here just now.",
"Long, long ago I made such, but I destroyed them, for I knew not what evil they might bring upon me were they discovered.",
"I have often and often been in greater danger than that.",
"This was like an electric shock to both of us.",
"How awful the consideration!",
"None are sent out but those who can really say they feel it to be their religious duty to go to any certain people or country.",
"We did not feel out of our place in being present, and I trust it may have its use both on ourselves and others.",
"The effect appeared quickly to pass off, and he was able to perform such religious duty as opened before him in the city and its immediate neighborhood.",
"The whole army was kept during the night in the military position called lying on their arms.",
"If she had rejected him, it was right.",
"His challenge was there to be faced.",
"His heart gave a little jump.",
"So we tried to lose ourselves in the only fields left for such as we.",
"Then her weekly letters became different.",
"The sight of his last finished sentence presented itself suddenly in a new light.",
"Telephone messages had reached him every quarter of an hour.",
"They moved over to the desk.",
"It was some little time before she settled down again to her story.",
"She held up her hands as though to shut out the sight of him.",
"For a moment she seemed about to collapse.",
"I have helped myself to a fresh start in life at his expense.",
"The whole shock of her discovery seemed already, in these few hours, to have passed away.",
"I stood behind the door, out of sight.",
"One plate did double duty, for we used the top for breakfast and the bottom for dinner.",
"And he had an honest face.",
"I drove.",
"And he was an honest man.",
"A friend promised me work.",
"I ought to do my duty.",
"He lost sight of him.",
"He turned once more to the witness, regarding him as if with interest.",
"She, too, slowly turned to the next witness.",
"What was the use of standing out against proof like that.",
"I found the body of a man lying in the entry.",
"He was as innocent as I am.",
"It was settled.",
"Anyway it was death to stay on the horse.",
"At the end of the reading table they stopped and faced each other.",
"What though no objects strike upon the sight!",
"But my mother and the woman seemed not to know my danger.",
"Her writing desk lay upon the table.",
"No one from this seems to think of doing so but ourselves.",
"On consideration, there seemed to be strong reasons for doing so.",
"One day there was an attack upon the farm by the blacks, as they are called.",
"And when he had said this he was taken away from the sight of them, and after that they might no more see him.",
"Release the innocent child!",
"The passage was free.",
"They settled the time and place for an evening meeting.",
"They declared that they would only protect themselves by organized powers, not by the people.",
"There was no bread.",
"This was the routine.",
"It must not be allowed to capture us, it must seek us and not find us.",
"It was settled that on the first notice that might be given I should go there.",
"He drove on, but slowly.",
"For ourselves we would accept it, such as it was, and nothing more.",
"Are they innocent?",
"She must be in the humor for it.",
"Had he been there to effect a new forced loan?",
"A narrow passage had been formed at one end.",
"A newspaper was lying on the table.",
"The night was so dark that they lost sight of him immediately.",
"In either case we shall have done our duty.",
"The danger was extreme.",
"The danger increased every moment.",
"I have not even done my duty.",
"The whole phenomenon lies in these few words.",
"To do justice to this case, I must give a history of the different circumstances connected with it.",
"They had become pretty generally convinced by this time, that their own personal safety was connected with the measure.",
"Let us look at some of the more striking parts of this system.",
"The son supports his mother.",
"Now permit me to return to the original subject.",
"Though years had passed since he had seen that form, he knew him at sight.",
"She was in sight of the church, when a short, fat little man suddenly met her.",
"The horse died in a few moments.",
"For let us not suppose that even the highest powers will take us out of the law of cause and effect.",
"That was a matter of honor.",
"No thought of danger comes to him.",
"It is a horrible thing.",
"And what was the use of staying here, he gone?",
"He picked up one of the open reviews, an old one by the way, and read a marked passage there.",
"He had already made a contract with one of the great electric companies.",
"He is old enough to have a sense of danger.",
"We enjoyed ourselves very much.",
"That was the routine.",
"The only really innocent conversation was when a man talked about himself.",
"We did not long, however, remain true to ourselves.",
"Now came an exciting scene.",
"This looked like proof of his being the man.",
"My awful duty was soon concluded.",
"There are certain principles which I consider ought never to be lost sight of.",
"So did the gas and electric light and telephone bills.",
"I never before had done that, and nothing had occurred which might make me think I should not be back at my desk as usual.",
"That settled it.",
"Meanwhile he discovered, to his surprise, that lying was not really so difficult an art as he had supposed it to be.",
"But most of all, we must keep them in close and living touch with the problems of daily duty and experience.",
"It does not touch the root of the matter.",
"Now take that thought of fighting evil with good and apply it to our world and to ourselves.",
"The only way out of danger is the way into work.",
"I shall do my duty.",
"He kept the horse close to the inner edge of the road.",
"Well, the first honest thing to do is to try and make good.",
"He looked up and made a forward jump.",
"There is no danger.",
"Many of those connected with the show were to leave.",
"He had the audience in fine, good humor.",
"Then he settled back in his chair.",
"I have another proof.",
"He suspected me.",
"I should never have suspected it.",
"I had it in my desk.",
"It was a dangerous thing to have lying around.",
"What right have we to bother her?",
"There is not much danger for them, certainly, in that direction.",
"Methods of teaching it differ.",
"There was a desk that he also claimed as his.",
"The children may not ever understand the religious experiences through which their parents are passing, but they often know what those experiences are.",
"Sometimes it happens that a child finds in our careful explanation of the meaning of a religious belief or practice a different or a further significance than we have indicated.",
"I once had an especially striking experience of this kind.",
"A few years ago, I was witness to a most striking example of this.",
"The crowd, by this time, was greatly increased.",
"He passed for honest otherwise.",
"Are enough to make any one thin!",
"One mile further there is another fine sight, though not of the comprehensive beauty of that just mentioned.",
"They faced each other on their feet.",
"Such a sight was no longer possible.",
"From here they would be distributed as needed.",
"He had done only his duty as he saw it.",
"For one thing he used the web shoes as an expert does.",
"Every hour increased the danger.",
"The danger is that one may come to it too soon.",
"With the other dogs he drove back and met the officer.",
"At any moment now they were likely to make a discovery.",
"For days the white fields had been very trying to the sight.",
"The horrible duty that had seemed to be laid upon him was not a duty at all.",
"West drove the team.",
"Even the native women she loved were not proof against it.",
"Consideration of and proposals for use of new weapons and material.",
"This drove me into a corner.",
"But she seemed to have lost interest in me and my affairs, now that all doubt was settled.",
"Yet I did sleep, and heavily.",
"But deeply in love as he is, he is a very proud fellow.",
"At first, when I began to suspect that something had been taken from its place, I had no proof.",
"Be proud of it.",
"Work is a service performed for ourselves and others.",
"But we now believe that corporations came because they were required.",
"And it is to this generation alone that the honor of first using it must be given.",
"She has great powers to do that for people.",
"They did not know of her unique experiences at all.",
"His feet, on the other hand, were enormous.",
"I do have some powers that I should try to make use of.",
"They could see for miles, and there was not a soul in sight.",
"None of these things bother the body because it is not aware of anything.",
"I had to be honest, after all.",
"And whenever they have painted truly, they have painted successfully.",
"Nature and men yield nothing new to such a mind.",
"We continue our routine.",
"I became daily more attached to her, and it ended in my making her a proposal, that was rejected.",
"He appeared to be greatly affected at this moment.",
"He ever held the goal full in view, and drove to it in the most immediate manner.",
"What a witness!",
"We had suspected it long ago, and become more and more certain of it as the years went on.",
"However, I have no proof that this was the cause.",
"This point was never to be settled.",
"It was a phenomenon.",
"Here was something requiring him to act.",
"A step at his door set him flying.",
"I had the same routine of morning work, only it was more extensive.",
"As I drove our people home they seemed to talk of nothing else.",
"Days grew into weeks and weeks into months, but the same routine of work went on.",
"Yet such was the horrible truth in not one case alone, but in many, as I know only too well.",
"The making of these pictures is getting to be an enormous industry.",
"Often their pictures prove of no value and are destroyed, but sometimes the scenes they catch are very useful to work into a picture play.",
"It was on the ground floor and easily reached by a passage.",
"They had, between them, considerable money, but they realized they could not enter a field that required such an enormous investment as film making.",
"He has no friends, so far as we know, other than ourselves.",
"The scene was short and not very exciting, although of interest in the present crisis.",
"The yield was enormous, and of excellent quality.",
"It all depends on which side the danger comes.",
"I am suspected, if not known.",
"Danger is never increased by being prepared to meet it.",
"We found one day in the face of a black bear what could not be so well found in libraries.",
"I cannot look upon him as ever in a very serious humor.",
"There is really nothing settled.",
"It is too early to predict where this movement will go, and how greatly it will affect the well established methods.",
"A doctor has to have a horse.",
"She had a bad attack of some nervous trouble then which seems to have been the beginning of everything.",
"She has a wonderful belief in it.",
"She must have suspected.",
"They faced each other, the man and the girl.",
"I felt that I must have this settled.",
"And she had faced this particular danger before.",
"No one had anything to do with taking it but ourselves.",
"The day must be faced and lived through.",
"I was staying with friends when I met him, at a church social.",
"But here, too, memory came too close and drove him aside into the fields.",
"If she saw the danger then, it was already too late.",
"Here was a danger indeed!",
"And what possible danger could there be?",
"She felt quite proud of her part in it.",
"At first sight he appeared almost as usual.",
"That had settled the matter.",
"Did he know anyone connected with the case?",
"Yes, the witness recognized her.",
"No, the witness did not.",
"Where was the witness standing?",
"It was a horrible movement.",
"But he had made a discovery.",
"That he already had the confidence of a horse that he had never before seen was perfectly apparent.",
"How long had it been lying there?",
"I never suspected anything.",
"Leading to all this bother, and to murder.",
"Those conditions have not been destroyed.",
"I had been only a short time in this place when a new bear came into sight.",
"If he continued in this direction he would soon be out of sight.",
"We had hardly got started the following day before it began to rain heavily.",
"We could not bring ourselves to the shooting point.",
"From the size of the track it seemed as if the animal must have been enormous.",
"The count settled down in his chair once more.",
"Or if we just tied the box up and kept him from getting any water maybe that would do as well.",
"We must be very careful to keep the matter to ourselves.",
"As for me, I find it easier to go out and meet danger than to wait for it.",
"We came to the firm belief, long ago, that he died that night.",
"But I should want something very strong in the way of proof.",
"There was no doubt that the fellow might hurt them greatly if he chose to do so.",
"No, there was but one thing for him, as an honest boy, to do, and that was to tell what he had heard.",
"He drove it out, but it returned.",
"Was it not the duty of a boy to do it?",
"Her honest desire to have right done had been too apparent from the start.",
"That settled the matter, at any rate.",
"There was danger in his eyes.",
"He could hardly realize the danger of his situation, it had all come upon him so suddenly.",
"The black, solid wall faced him before he was hardly aware of it.",
"He moved from side to side of the passage, feeling his way.",
"Suppose the days and months and years should pass away, and no one ever know what high honor came to him while yet he lived on earth.",
"God save us, thin!",
"Literary property.",
"His minute knowledge in various arts.",
"Now the use of any figure of speech can never be a duty.",
"All tied up on the children.",
"That is settled.",
"A line dropped from the edge of the desk should strike the front edge of the seat.",
"They vary greatly in shape and size, according to their position and use.",
"The proper amount of exercise must vary greatly with circumstances.",
"In standing, the rate is more than when lying at rest.",
"The records of medical science fail to show any proof whatever to support this impression.",
"One experiences a feeling of heat.",
"They lower the action of the heart and the tone of the nervous centers.",
"As fast as destroyed, the tissue becomes white.",
"Something connected with a part.",
"A portion of the body having some special function or duty.",
"This settled, they went to bed.",
"I have suspected as much for some time.",
"He must yield if she kept it there.",
"There he would stay whole days, entirely out of sight.",
"It must depend upon circumstances.",
"It was her duty to know something of these, and of course she did.",
"My horse!",
"He looked back several times, and finally passed out of sight.",
"And, in fact, this was her only literary education.",
"My friend had heard that this man had seen a wonderful sight of some kind, and at last we got the story out of him.",
"She told no one, for she was very proud.",
"She got very thin.",
"It was a thing, he said, to be proud of and afraid of.",
"It was a warning I was staying too long.",
"I had a sight of it one time in a vision.",
"A woman told me of a sight that she and others had seen by a certain deep pool in the river.",
"The character of the country is similar to that of the interior of some parts of the western coast.",
"I promised that I would.",
"Now, my dear, for the promised subject.",
"I will see him in the morning, because I promised I would.",
"But right here is where the day began to differ from other days.",
"So people did not bother him.",
"Fall and winter are his flying times.",
"But before they even came in sight of the tree they heard music.",
"I promised to use what influence I had to keep him in the city.",
"He agreed to do so, and bought her a horse.",
"But she said nothing, perhaps being too proud to admit her fault.",
"They had greatly enjoyed the visit.",
"He went to the other end of the shop to an elderly man who sat behind a desk.",
"When she was well enough, he had promised that she should help him among his own poor.",
"Upon the whole, she seemed rather proud of her position.",
"For peace I yield to wrong.",
"We will ourselves step in and visit him.",
"I did not meet him yet, my honest friend.",
"My honest friend!",
"And if it do, what is the danger then?",
"She had had an exciting night herself.",
"It was a case of love at first sight with both of us.",
"When I arrived they were lying dead upon the ground.",
"There was a thin white edge between the skin and the red line.",
"As he was talking, the son of the man in whose house we were staying entered the room.",
"Let us seek a new country for ourselves.",
"This made her angry, but we soon became friends again, and fell to talking about ourselves.",
"Only it was not his horse.",
"But I got my duty to my company.",
"Her horse!",
"He had actually run off with the horse of this beautiful being.",
"He tied his horse.",
"It was an amazing sight.",
"Looked like he was trying to keep out of sight.",
"The man and the girl and the horse made good time.",
"And there was only one horse.",
"And now he saw, and he thought the sight very pretty.",
"And then, on the evening of a very hot day, he saw a sight.",
"Suddenly, he saw a beautiful sight.",
"What can they want with flying, and raising themselves above their proper station in life?",
"She had taken to him at sight.",
"His voice, too, was rather striking.",
"I have done my duty, but I do not think that I wish to live very much longer.",
"And they will get them from women, depend upon it, my friend.",
"Besides, I was on duty.",
"It was my duty to stick to her, to study her.",
"He did not know, of course, or in the last degree suspect that she designed his capture as a professional victim.",
"Of course he has not, but we must not take anything for granted.",
"It is a wonderful phenomenon.",
"It occurred while he was staying with us.",
"It is too horrible!",
"Well, well, it is a most horrible affair.",
"However material the creation, the spirit which gives beauty to it is of the mind and soul.",
"His literary capacity is good, and it has been well trained.",
"I in its striking.",
"By the powers!",
"But space will not permit of this.",
"Its danger in other cases.",
"Danger of too early sitting up.",
"Duty of mothers in this matter.",
"To all who reason but for a moment on this subject, the danger of such a practice must be obvious.",
"Importance of good bread.",
"But I have already said as much on this subject, in another place, as my limits will permit.",
"It is strange, in particular, what views people have about bread.",
"Duty to himself or to others will not move him.",
"The shock thus produced to the nervous system has sometimes been so great as to produce sudden death.",
"But I have proof on this subject.",
"And yet what do we too often witness in life?",
"The honest man could contain himself no longer.",
"He will either be raised to honor or have his head cut off.",
"Expenses had been greater than she had calculated.",
"He looked thin and very serious.",
"Had his country been free, he would have died in honor.",
"To the student of the literary history of those times they are of great interest and importance.",
"The discovery is this.",
"Where he shall have bread for his family?",
"The writer of it was out of sight and hearing.",
"I could see the desk with the open letter upon it.",
"The little girl is in sight now.",
"Now for the great exciting subject of the present time.",
"Again, in the neighborhood of the discovery of the broken stone was an old building, used as a stable, and for other mean purposes.",
"It was settled where they were to live.",
"Where was that heart lying?",
"As I said those last words, the poor man seemed to find his powers of speech again.",
"But we are not aware of any proof of the truth of these stories having been discovered in recent times.",
"Honor to speech!",
"I had before suspected that they did not tell me the worst.",
"I think the first ride I took in it was the most exciting event of my life.",
"No words are needed here as proof.",
"We have settled when old age begins.",
"This is the story of talking at a distance, of sending messages through space.",
"And yet many centuries passed without the discovery of an effective system.",
"The first test had been completed successfully.",
"It seemed entirely possible that the messages would move so slowly that the operation of the cable, once it was laid, would not pay.",
"But it would not talk successfully.",
"There are many limitations to the use of the other for talking purposes, and it cannot be drawn upon too strongly by the man of science.",
"But there is no time in this life to estimate its losses.",
"His jump fell short.",
"Let us essay to do it as it should be done.",
"The personal equation is everything on the road, as elsewhere.",
"It then became important to find out what was the power of the horse.",
"No one, for we cannot tell ourselves.",
"Sad sight!",
"After consideration, it is allowed to remain.",
"She saw me lying there, but she never stopped nor turned her head.",
"The costs have been enormous.",
"It is a creation of the brain.",
"In the space of a few moments he had greatly changed.",
"Besides, when he had heard what the count had to say, it was clearly his duty to reason with him.",
"Who could tell that he might not yield to such a process?",
"It was horrible!",
"The desk is covered with papers.",
"She signs to him to lay his book upon her desk.",
"She could not speak, it was too horrible.",
"He drove her image from him.",
"Before I go, however, all must be settled about our marriage, and the contract signed.",
"I shall struggle with horrible thoughts all night.",
"He turns very red, but he is too proud to cry.",
"It is my duty.",
"The marriage is essential to the honor of my house.",
"I shall have done my duty.",
"Public opinion would not permit it.",
"We shall now act for ourselves.",
"That of course settled the matter.",
"The more immediate danger decided his resolution.",
"It is, that a duty may be done in the most direct way possible.",
"The proof?",
"The proof is here.",
"Would that be a lying spirit?",
"The coach drove away.",
"All depends upon who it is that is lying.",
"From each point of view it becomes more and more striking.",
"Then we keep under cover for a short space, after which we find ourselves at the foot of a long flight of steps.",
"They are much more striking when seen from close at hand.",
"The view from here in fine weather is very striking.",
"When, however, it came to requiring me to have faith in what seemed good to him and his friends, rather than to me and mine, we did not agree so well.",
"Poor old horse!",
"Are any of us suspected?",
"No one else was in sight.",
"I do not remember that I felt anything like surprise at this discovery.",
"He seemed a good model for a character in fiction.",
"The witness understood.",
"Furthermore, this was only a horse.",
"The expense!",
"I do not see that this is proof.",
"What I do is a simple duty.",
"Then there was indeed a sight to be seen!",
"Just as he was about to push off, another man came down and asked for a passage.",
"Because of this, we increased the size of the engine.",
"Take the engine.",
"Our very lives depend upon them.",
"But we are not done with that engine yet.",
"The engine is powerful.",
"Let the engine do it.",
"It is more necessary than bread.",
"This is a good, strong engine.",
"To look at it is to realize that expense cut no figure where it was concerned.",
"And the taste of power I had received drove me on.",
"I was going to find those flying fish.",
"One spot in particular I remember, where we started a stone the size of a horse.",
"And how would we ever find ourselves?",
"Thus one danger was removed.",
"The blacks formed a wall in front of us and refused to let us pass.",
"The blacks said we could go on.",
"Thus the passage at present remains dark.",
"Immediately they received their sight and followed him.",
"And the horse for myself!",
"I never have seen so beautiful a horse.",
"He was honest.",
"Lying back with closed eyes, I lost count of time.",
"They did not permit themselves to think it.",
"There is only one judge who knows how to do his duty, now.",
"It was not a very large one, for, it requiring some activity to go up, all the old people remained at home.",
"If we are sick, let us prefer conversation upon any subject rather than upon ourselves.",
"True belief is rare and difficult.",
"Nobody wanted further proof.",
"Nothing was found but the root, yet nothing could have been more strange!",
"Danger faced him for the next day!",
"We, who have seen all the life that we care to see, do not ourselves feel equal to the task of showing them about.",
"Powers of man!",
"That is all my literary news.",
"It was a fine sight.",
"The cold was beyond belief.",
"I am not proud nor particular.",
"The great double danger of taking life too easily, and taking it too hard, how difficult it is to balance that!",
"He had promised to come and stay with us this summer.",
"I have a taste for danger, which is human, like the fear of it.",
"And I have all the time on my hands for literary work.",
"A horse.",
"Lying down to sleep.",
"How is all this expense supported?",
"How did he support such expense?",
"Let us think over this passage, and examine its words.",
"There is no need of words of mine for proof of this.",
"Witness now had a film over his eyes.",
"I distributed all that I had with me.",
"I knew that the man was a horrible criminal.",
"My desire was granted.",
"We had been prepared to witness nothing except what was terrible.",
"I began this essay at once, and it seemed to me that in it I was saying a very great deal that was important.",
"This is what happened to me, when I began to write my essay.",
"We only need to look ourselves, at the way we have in the country, and at the manner in which we support people there.",
"Be with our friends, be with ourselves.",
"What the second duty is no one has as yet discovered.",
"He thinks we shall never get through the interior!",
"The heads and faces are very striking."],

"The power of a king is the power of control.",
"It is a curious thing, this little turn in the brain, a thought.",
"Words have a curious power within themselves.",
"Traffic is educational.",
"The ship responded perfectly.",
"Beyond, close under the rise of the hill, was another.",
"Yet he displayed a certain interest in their needs and affairs.",
"The thought came to me to kill this man and so to escape and make cause with the scientists.",
"The crew sat up again.",
"They put back to the ship.",
"I have never seen it among any other of the waters of this country, and never there but once.",
"These last are, of course, nearly lost to the landscape.",

"One curious article I must note.",
"I checked myself.",
"In reality it was merely so that the partners for the meal should be chosen by chance.",
"He was beginning to believe in his own illness, as usual.",
"I have a curious feeling sometimes.",
"We need it badly for food.",
"The mission house where they lived was high on a hill above the town.",
"The king came forward to meet her.",
"The king and the people were sorry to see her go.",
"This left her with a sick sister and no salary.",
"After this he came often to visit his little girl and brought her food and presents.",
"They began to make the roof.",
"Now she invited them to her new house.",

"The government officers were kind and helpful to her in getting ready for her trip.",
"Here a great crowd filled the biggest hall in town.",
"I take the air and stretch myself.",
"Several years of broken health had been followed by years that were for the most part free from suffering.",
"I was thinking about that as I lay on the hill.",
"Now please let me finish what came to me this afternoon on the hill!",
"To attempt to rescue them seemed quite out of the question.",
"I seemed to have no legs.",
"Then he gave a curious laugh, as he turned over the paper as though seeking an address, and laid it back in the box.",
"By that means I could pull it down after me when I reached the ground, and so not only effect my escape but also leave the fact unknown.",
"It was a great blow to all of the family, and especially to father who seemed to be almost heart broken over it.",
"I am sure if they had captured him that night, they would have killed him.",
"My first plan of escape having failed, I now determined upon another.",
"He never was tried, however, for he soon made his escape, as I expected he would do.",
"I spoke to him and he recognized me at once and invited me to enter.",
"After spending an evening together at a private house he invited me, on our return, into his room.",
"A brilliant idea struck him.",
"The first drawing he made had a strange appearance.",
"I am not mad!",
"It had been a brilliant night.",

"Sometimes he would lie still before he could pull himself on his legs again.",
"So they pushed on.",
"The night was heavy and thick.",
"Birds are singing everywhere.",
"A heavy blow.",
"Kind of mad, believes it all.",
"And it did make him mad at first, but the odd thing was he got over it, and used to stop and say something now and then.",
"Or rather mad.",
"Not mad!",
"It was a curious accident, though.",
"Yet, she is standing by him through thick and thin.",
"Her hands, too, opened and shut tight before she spoke.",
"The world was not ready to believe in the educational value of play, just pure play.",
"Another kind of drawing which children seem to find for themselves is what they call making patterns.",
"When shall I make my little ship?",
"We left there that night, and pushed on again until morning.",
"This may have been originally a course for the waters of the river.",
"But the king again refused.",
"But he was not prepared for independence.",
"This order was repeated in other parts of the ship.",
"Coffee was served in the drawing room.",
"I had a shot at him, but I missed, and his legs were too long for me.",
"I knew the folk.",
"But the trees were so thick that I could see nothing from the first rise, and I tried to reach a green hill that looked near.",
"This seemed a mad saying.",
"But money was very tight.",
"I pushed them from me on every side with the strength of a giant.",
"If this were to go on forever, I said to myself, I should soon go mad.",
"Suffering is not the word.",
"I had a spell once.",
"Myself invited me to this new place as to a home.",
"How silly it was, after all!",

"And, on account of the variety and beauty of its elements, is considered the most remarkable.",
"There are, at the present day, certain groups of animals which are never found in fresh waters, being unable to live anywhere but in the sea.",
"Finally, yet another curious consideration.",
"When I examine it, what appears to be the most striking character it presents?",
"If she had been a man he would have bid her to battle on the spot.",
"Which will reach the hill first?",
"Not a man of them can escape.",
"I have a chance to escape, no matter how, but I can make my way to our lines without running any great risk.",
"The curious thing is that the women are more taken with the idea of fight than the men.",
"We have salt, water, and fire.",
"This happens constantly.",
"May be her judgment is right this time.",
"Come, free me of my bonds.",
"Some of the results were, under the circumstances, curious.",
"A single blow would do it.",
"She was, indeed, a brilliant figure.",
"Indeed, like most men, suffering made him a good deal of a boy.",
"I start up the hill in an hour.",
"But he allowed himself to be pushed away.",
"I ran back along the hall, into the room which he had entered.",
"We left the door open so that we could see right along the hall, clear to the front door.",
"But wait in the hall outside.",
"He sat down there, right under my nose, wrote that letter, dropped it into my box, and walked out.",
"Give me that drawing and those patterns back.",
"He looked hopefully from one to the other, as though he expected to see his advice accepted and put into immediate practice.",
"She must be suffering now.",
"How silly of her not to take him!",
"The ship was gone a long time.",
"Just then a ship was seen.",
"Then he gave them many presents of such things as they liked.",

"He made pictures of birds and of animals.",
"His men had nothing but rough clothes to wear.",

"The fire ran so fast, that some of the men had trouble to get off the ship.",
"Then they pushed hard to get away from the fire.",
"It was thick in the middle, and thin at the edge.",
"He wanted living birds to study.",
"His father told him that he could not keep so many birds alive.",
"He thought that he could make pictures that would look like the live birds.",
"All this time he was learning to draw birds.",
"But he was not willing to make pictures that were not just like the real birds.",
"He made pictures of these eggs.",
"He meant to tell all about the birds in one book.",
"He meant to have them look just like the birds.",
"He would have to find and shoot the birds, in order to make pictures of them.",
"Thus he made his pictures just the size of the birds themselves.",
"The ship seemed ready to fall over on her side.",
"The ship was frozen into the ice.",
"He wanted to get the ship out.",
"It did not sound like the cry of sea birds.",
"They pushed their little boat into the water once more.",
"It is his nose.",
"He does not like to be hit on the nose.",
"The bear was sure to get his nose hurt.",
"Twice a day all the children stood up to spell.",
"They used to hold meetings at night to spell.",
"He would spell it right, too.",
"A cat may look at a king.",
"We cannot escape them if we would.",
"Speech that is not informed is like a house without a foundation.",
"When the cars stopped he pushed down the window and looked out.",
"Some of the first are pretty good manufacturers, but stop at that.",
"When the meal was over he took them away.",
"He pushed the door open and stopped.",
"I remember still when I first noticed this grass particularly.",
"What more remarkable object can there be in the landscape?",
"Else we shall not, in the long run, escape bad taste.",
"He did not seem to see me, as I stood waiting in the hall.",
"The rough boy came to me.",
"The sign a ship.",
"If we are so poor, let us know our poverty.",
"The blow was final.",
"Some of the letters were from women folk and told of war conditions in the capital.",
"Perhaps women will demonstrate the national characteristic.",
"The act of buying is creative.",
"In our poverty we will test all things in the light of their benefit to the race and hold fast that which is good.",
"He was swimming through the water as fast as possible.",
"He turned in his seat, and there, not a mile and a half away, was a ship of war.",
"No ship in action is to go to the aid of another.",
"From one part of the ship to the other they had been running with orders ever since the battle opened.",
"It was characteristic of him that he made no cry for help.",
"I have had my means of escape laid out ever since I arrived here.",
"Now for the crew.",
"Its architecture was remarkable.",
"He must have been mad.",
"Then he noticed that there was a light in the hall and that the hall door was open.",
"They followed the girl into the hall, and into a room off the hall to which she led the way.",
"Hill took it with him, saying he would post it on his way home.",
"Hill with some spirit.",
"Hill says the plan was drawn at the flat.",
"Hill, he declared, was an honest witness.",
"I pushed it wide open and went in.",
"He told the court a remarkable story.",
"I walked across the garden and found that the hall door was wide open.",
"I must follow and find her and rescue her if possible from the snow.",
"It lay a few feet beyond me down the narrow hall I have just mentioned.",
"The shoes which I had taken off in the lower hall were yet in my hand.",
"Nothing seemed to escape his eye.",
"He found himself at once in a narrow hall, from the end of which opened a large room.",
"His manner of going about this was characteristic.",
"He was almost rough in these answers.",
"Did that offer a good foundation for crime?",
"Had the fact made me curious to examine her hand?",
"I wonder under whose advice he chose him for his counsel.",
"An open window in the hall!",
"That counsel I had already noted.",
"But no blow fell to drive him back.",
"He made no move to escape or to attack.",
"But he had lost the power to stand upon his legs.",
"For a long time he went hopefully, looking each day or night to see some sign of life there.",
"The night that followed was clear, and brilliant with stars.",
"This, too, they left after a single meal.",
"Other finds came thick and fast.",
"The most recent songs treat of contemporary events.",
"They ran all over the ship looking at everything.",
"This city had no king.",
"But hear my counsel now.",
"He was king of that country.",
"I am going to stretch myself out as if I were dead.",
"Contemporary writers, however, it must be added, do not mention this.",
"As we see it, this is not curious at all.",
"But what is really curious the special does not tell us.",
"This is a great raising county.",
"By this time it was perfectly explained how the water made a noise, for he saw it escape by an opening in the side of the well.",
"To get it for him, his grandmother had had to send to the bank in the county town.",
"His mother especially was glad to have him under the same roof once more at night.",
"But the more rich people that came, the more poor people they invited.",
"He has gone mad like the rest of them.",
"Then the first blow fell.",
"Something of my thought she must have understood, for she was very kind to me, and never by any word or act showed that she thought of the poverty of my condition.",
"She had hit me a hard blow, and she knew it.",
"I read the note through a second time before I realized what a blow it gave to all my hopes.",
"Demand to be led before the king.",
"She was in her chamber, but not alone.",
"The next meeting took place in her chamber, where her father discovered them.",
"The next day prices were up, and the standards fixed behind the front soon ruled at the line itself.",
"He knew the value of that hill.",
"At a later date there was further strong fighting around this hill, and at one period it became impossible for either side to hold it.",
"But the extent and variety of his general reading was remarkable.",
"And the sight that met his eyes was very curious.",
"I was ruled by others.",
"Her people treated her very badly indeed.",
"His words suggested a brilliant idea.",
"Yet I felt it my duty to attempt the rescue.",
"The small letters are written in silver.",
"With more or less foundation, they were accused of horrible crimes.",
"They have straight hair, hanging down.",
"Some people have a very curious way of doing things.",
"For he, too, was drawing guns.",
"But they never came very near to hitting us.",
"But one day we had a lucky escape.",
"Some of these names filled me with memories of a year, and more than a year, ago.",
"I pushed back my chair.",
"The paper is merely drawing interest.",
"It was a strange meal.",
"It seemed to me he had gone quite mad.",
"What was the use of all this comedy?",
"These details were helpful.",
"My visit at its close cannot be helpful.",
"He held to it, through thick and thin, for many days.",
"The county police will get all the credit.",
"He checked himself in time.",
"Grant rather badly.",
"Up to this time no actual blow of war had been struck.",
"He ruled all the rest of the little world round about him.",
"The leaves were all coming out, the weather was brilliant.",
"It was only when they forced his head into the waters of knowledge that he refused to drink.",
"Effects of the war for independence.",
"The quality of the forces was even more remarkable than the number.",
"At every turn she was upon him, and let him escape her neither by day nor by night.",
"His application was great, his memory remarkable.",
"How, when he tries to do good, evil is present with him.",
"Yes, the king was very angry, as he had a right to be.",
"I do not however think this helpful to the right sense.",
"This last was a curious natural phenomenon and must have been worth seeing.",
"He did not seem to be suffering any pain.",
"The connection was rather curious.",
"His legs were short and his arms long.",
"He had heard of this curious class.",
"And look at the grass!",
"Why, the seasons are changed about.",
"The birds of the air would not be so free as I should.",
"It will be very curious.",
"The salt sea is never as grand as when it is left to itself.",
"They are badly off, and she often comes in.",
"But, for the matter of that, folk are as badly off here as anywhere in the world, I think.",
"All I have to do is buy a ticket.",
"She was not looking in their direction, so she did not notice that they were coming toward her until it was too late to escape.",
"No, he would need another plan of rescue.",

"But this, I think, has no foundation in fact.",
"Evening was drawing on.",
"Men travel far to see a city, but few seem curious about a river.",

"He pushed open the door.",
"How curious!",
"She knew she was playing a losing game very badly.",
"It had never presented itself to him in that light, the wonderful stretch of country over which they were looking.",
"I am not curious in that way.",
"A useful neighbor!",
"He did not add that no great illness is required to kill a small child.",
"She was ruled by both.",
"Then he checked himself.",
"The minister came to her rescue.",
"They were invited to take positions in the new schools.",
"Then there was such shopping in the county town!",
"These rough boys feel the power of her presence.",
"Season with a little salt.",
"Season with salt, and add the sugar.",
"If necessary, add salt.",
"Add salt to taste.",
"They should not be very thick.",
"All the birds that were under the net could then see him, but none that were in the lake could.",
"Eggs are not equivalent to the same weight of meat.",
"If this is not sufficient, the hand should be constantly and quickly opened and shut for the same purpose.",
"The mixture should be nearly as thick as cream, and plenty of it given.",
"One can never spell out the meaning by putting together the group with the aid of such a key.",
"Several more were captured.",
"There is no man in the world, he says, whom he loves so much as his king.",
"Yet the birds keep at work all the time.",
"This is the most limited in its range of all our birds.",
"This counsel is as old as the world.",
"Nothing in his life was more remarkable than the new character in which he now appeared.",
"They did not even spell their names the same way.",
"Thus each wave passed over the one ahead of it, and fresh troops were constantly coming to the front.",
"Both my legs are broken.",
"One never sees them and one is constantly under fire.",

"I held out my hand and laid a piece of silver on it.",
"After a spell of watching a woman called out that she saw something moving up the channel, just below where she was standing.",
"I shall strike the first blow.",
"He shall not escape!",
"He was too proud to take any of his family into his confidence since they had in his view treated him very badly.",
"At a distance, he ruled with a tight and heavy hand.",
"He charged on who could, and he who could no longer strike still pushed forward.",
"It is a land of poverty!",
"Now, however, they changed their behavior to a remarkable degree.",
"I should think it would drive her mad.",
"I told him briefly but exactly what had passed from the moment when I missed her to that of her rescue.",
"In fact, however, the sides were of open work, and only the roof and floor were solid.",
"By this time our evening meal was ready.",
"This little incident was characteristic in more ways than one.",
"Equally characteristic was the conduct of the others.",
"She was seen to fall from the roof of her house, and none was near her when she fell.",
"It was a modern house, white, with a red roof.",
"Then a cold wind seemed to blow over her.",
"The hall was dark and quiet.",
"Only in the east, over the hill, did the air appear clear.",
"But here its speed was checked.",
"His legs had not been tied.",
"He could escape now.",
"There was no grass.",

"Summer had come with its birds and flowers.",
"She could not escape from either.",
"The remarkable happened.",
"She said the studio was that of her friend.",
"Up to this moment my one dream has been to escape, but I must give that up now.",
"Time alone gave me judgment as to the distance they would travel.",
"One of my men struck him down, but it was not a death blow.",
"I have had no opportunity even to learn the true nature of the crew.",

"But he was not quick enough though to escape her arm.",
"I walked to the door and looked out into the hall.",
"I thought I would take a walk through the lower hall, and then go to bed again.",
"It seemed to me that I would go mad if I could not get that door open.",
"He was going to escape.",
"A dog that has all the water he wants, will never go mad.",
"One went by a river, and the other went over the hill.",
"I think they felt sorry for the birds.",
"I felt so badly to hear this that I went and stood with my head in a corner.",
"It had just dropped into the water, and was swimming toward the bank we had left.",

"There were houses, a town hall, a church, a school.",
"True, victory was becoming more and more certain as the estate expanded.",
"This was the final blow.",
"I should go mad!",
"Would she not always have time to stretch out her arms when he was there before her?",

"King too.",
"Our king we do not.",

"She appeared to be more curious than interested.",
"After that it was easy to cut off the alcohol by degrees as he grew to like his eggs in milk the more.",
"This office done, they walked away together in the direction of the secret chamber.",
"At this time his personal appearance was remarkable.",
"Felt my heart expanded towards the universe.",
"We hope therefore that all concerned will take rather than lose heart and treat hanging as an ordinary affair of life.",
"It is because we have been divided and they have ruled.",
"Might I recommend the consideration of the following course of conduct?",
"I know that my people have sometimes gone mad.",
"But I had made my plans for escape in case my hope should not be realized.",
"Most of these old stories are too silly to repeat, but some of them had foundation in fact.",
"To escape from that region would have been impossible.",
"For what end this may be I know not, but the suffering time is hard to the natural part.",
"The help which I at times experience in these trying seasons is wonderful in my eyes.",
"It is remarkable in what a spirit of love they received us.",
"The salt water being warm, and the time not long, we received no further injury.",
"They all say it is remarkable we should be sent among them in this time of war in the land with the message of peace.",
"She had invited a number of friends to meet us.",
"It will all blow over, and no one will ask us any questions.",
"There, I see father on the hill.",
"I allow no man to fight on this ship but myself.",
"Every man for himself was now the cry throughout the ship.",
"Another house, lower down the hill, was also on fire.",
"I knew in my heart that we were both ready for evil things, if by evil things we could make our escape.",
"They were writers and actors and journalists.",
"There was no escape!",
"As he sat there he saw it pushed open.",
"Tell me quickly, before I go mad!",
"I had made up my mind months before to escape whenever the opportunity came.",
"He pushed her away.",
"Have I not seen my wife and children suffering for want of proper food and clothing?",
"I shall be curious about this.",
"He picked up the silver ticket again and turned it over and over.",
"Only certain folk knew of it.",
"One of the old original silver stand tickets.",
"Nor was it to escape meeting the women.",
"It was silly!",
"It had not occurred to her that rescue was possible.",
"However, there was still a means of escape.",
"All he wanted now was to let the thing blow over.",
"The blow went home.",
"Another remarkable fact in the history of those great men is that they were all men of affairs.",
"Here is a portion of one which I hope may be helpful to some of my readers.",
"I have few memories of winter days at this period of my life, though many of the summer.",
"Her eyes are tight closed.",
"All things, good and bad, they shared together, save one, which made them mad.",
"He was growing curious.",
"In the hall he met his pretty child.",
"One idea was now constantly present in her mind.",
"In its way the voice was as remarkable as the beauty of the face, the soft fire of the dark eyes.",
"Once only in the course of the meal did her father speak.",
"The name struck on her heart like a stroke causing actual physical pain.",
"When the morning was up, they had him to the top of the house, and bid him look south.",
"So he was bid to stand by.",
"Then they took him up, and carried him through the air, to the door that I saw in the side of the hill, and put him in there.",
"At last they took off her shoes, and her legs became quiet.",
"The church had come to the poor girl in her narrow room, or her chamber had become a church.",
"Sick and suffering, he came to his home.",
"The blow has been struck in such a manner that it is not realized.",
"Blow for blow.",
"Suddenly a man entered the hall.",
"All did not go up at once into the hall where the meeting was to take place.",
"The soldiers pushed him back.",
"It seemed easy to rescue them.",
"Let us rescue them!",
"Besides, it was the counsel which I had already given.",
"I pushed it, and entered.",
"Yet another characteristic detail.",
"Both of his legs were broken.",
"He was captured and killed.",
"We still pushed forward.",
"If they had merely pushed against it, they would have seen that it was not shut, and would have entered.",
"He received him badly.",
"It should not be mixed with the water or sugar until wanted, and not more made than will be taken by the child at the time, for it must be prepared fresh at every meal.",
"Exercise in the water, particularly that of swimming, is highly useful.",
"He knew that the king replaced him, however.",
"Their duty was to consider circumstances and recommend measures for the general good.",
"The grass grew short and in places there was none at all.",
"For one without training, he displayed wonderful military ability.",
"The fellow is struck mad.",
"The king.",
"Art mad?",
"He was a helpful man.",
"I invited him to my house, and he came often.",
"They think he has gone mad.",
"The man tried to move his legs.",
"Neither knew the effect of such a blow delivered properly at the base of the brain.",
"It is said that they were warned in a dream that they must escape.",
"It was my only chance of escape.",
"Had he been true to himself what a brilliant life was open to him!",
"Illness would be a very serious matter, as I had arrived at an important stage in my career.",
"His escape was rather interesting.",
"And what could the most brilliant do beyond that?",
"Then a curious event occurred.",
"The blow fell without warning.",
"It had no associations and no history.",
"The gold on it is quite thick.",
"He checked himself.",
"He might be captured inside at once.",
"The bands began to play.",
"Several were after an advance on their salary.",
"Boss says he thinks he will be a drawing card.",
"The route led up a hill.",
"The season started out badly and kept it up.",
"The manager pushed him back.",
"He met one with a blow that laid him flat.",
"He stood by us through thick and thin, he makes a good showing in the ring.",
"But it seems a very remarkable course of action.",
"I was silly to think it could come true!",
"But we shall not be invited to participate.",
"The little girl was invited to go to see it.",
"Hall appeared as our counsel.",
"He cannot escape.",
"I have heard counsel seeking to establish principles that strike directly at the security of southern property.",
"Had that mad flight been for nothing?",
"Why did not the blow fall?",
"These were deep waters.",
"For a brief spell the girl had continued to regard him and she had seemed about to speak further.",
"We gave him the money, and asked to taste some honest country wine, which resulted in the domestic bringing us something rather strong, like new port, which did not go badly with water.",
"She had discovered him lying in the grass.",
"The man wanted to let his boss know what had taken place and to give him a chance to rescue him if he would.",
"He could afford to take a chance on the rescue.",
"It was characteristic of him that he suspected the worst of her.",
"But the dance was an escape.",
"He would shoot her down rather than see her escape.",
"Soon it would be too late for either of them to escape.",
"Pretty badly hurt, though.",
"Too tight.",
"The matter was kept constantly under review.",
"Perhaps she had nothing except her salary, then, whereas she must have saved up a lot of money by this time.",
"He had lost his ticket, he said.",
"Perhaps this new idea was a mad one, I told myself.",
"They found her in the hall.",
"She did her spell once more.",
"She keeps it hanging over her bed in such a way that it is the last thing she looks upon at night.",
"It, however, served to make his introduction remarkable.",
"They met there with nothing remarkable.",
"That was characteristic of him.",
"There were even birds, to fill the air with music.",
"If they have a king, he must be inside that tree, of course.",
"But I have another, and a yet more curious one.",
"How should they escape it?",
"The grass.",
"We were in the hotel, and he was going out to get the tickets.",
"A look of suffering was in his eyes.",
"We make our bed of leaves, have fuel sufficient, and catch a great many birds and live fish.",
"As soon as I had got the net in order they would approach the birds slowly, driving them into it.",
"I only worked on the farm in busy seasons, and did not have the regular wear of the farm hands.",
"It was terrible, but there was no escape.",
"All who came near were captured.",
"While at the salt works I had a little experience at nursing.",
"I did not talk much to my wife about going away, as she was always so afraid I would be killed, and did not want me to try any more to escape.",
"He is invited out to tea by them every evening.",
"It seems to me such a breakfast is worth months of suffering.",
"In my judgment they are one and the same.",
"Then the hanging, itself, I should think would stand us in hand a day for each side.",
"But this resistance is constantly becoming less.",
"This last blow was too much for his poor mother.",
"We are concerned with the birds only as they are in a state of nature.",
"Then everything was over and no rescue from going to bed at once.",
"This was a fixed and general idea of the people on the top of the hill.",
"It was a long hill, very long, much longer than it had any need or right to be.",
"He was lying, very easily, upon soft grass.",
"Girl friends she had in plenty but not one whose judgment she could trust before her own.",
"The door opened wide, showing a long empty hall.",
"It had no foundation.",
"I believe in my heart that our mad marriage killed her.",
"I had begun to fear that it would drive me mad.",
"Then I am telling my story very badly.",
"At present I am capable of managing my own affairs.",
"Every one who has ever owned a motor knows that these things be.",
"Give the motor a rest.",
"Well, he had been invited to come and see.",
"Except to tell them how silly they are.",
"If I am, she will put me away with the mad people.",
"Again the strange mad look.",
"We shall have to discuss ways of managing so that people will not know.",
"It was not a successful meal.",
"Some one was coming down the hill.",
"She at least would have her memories.",
"Was there another sound on the hill, too?",
"The telephone was busy constantly.",
"Everything they did was with and by the advice of counsel.",
"She looked at him hopefully.",
"He got up, mad all through.",
"He had stayed in that hotel often, and he knew where the switch of the electric light should be.",
"Of course, I talked to some of them, in the ordinary way, as one does talk on board ship.",
"We want to work in entire independence of the police, for instance.",
"All business folk know that.",
"In the circumstances it is far too much to expect to escape criticism.",
"We saw several of these great birds.",
"Sometimes instead of a single road we have a double one, the bear using one path for the legs of each side of his body.",
"I have killed only one that had the disease badly, but I used to see them every day, and pay no attention to them.",
"Was it that they had detected that this was not their own ship?",
"Had the ship been captured in his absence?",
"Was the ship in action?",
"Had the ship been taken, then?",
"Never once would he trust himself outside his own ship and away from his own men.",
"But those class fees!",
"But perhaps he could escape exposure after all.",
"Poverty is my worst crime.",
"He had died to rescue others.",
"No one can ride without a ticket or a pass.",
"He came at last, and she met him in the hall.",
"He determined to be up and doing, with the light and energy that he had, looking constantly ahead for more.",
"The air that was now coming up the chamber was very bad, and it was blue with smoke, besides.",
"It was a very long chamber.",
"Now, however, he began to consider the matter of his escape.",
"He felt that he must escape from it.",
"Not far away the roof came down to meet it.",
"Rather a curious type.",
"He did not stay long, but soon joined us in the drawing room.",
"His mind was less on the stretch in doing the one than the other.",
"Going down the hill on the other side was no easy task.",
"The sea was very rough, and the boat took in a good deal of water.",
"This was really the hall of a chief.",
"I took the opportunity of a long illness to leave it off.",
"The roof is generally bad.",
"It is curious to see people, how far so ever removed from each other in the general system of their lives, come close together on a particular point which is common to each.",
"As we advanced, the storm grew greater, and the sea very rough.",
"If one was to think constantly of death, the business of life would stand still.",
"Our conversation was not brilliant.",
"There seemed in the whole more cost than judgment.",
"I do not see anything silly in the story.",
"I shall bid them all good night just as usual.",
"He invited all her relatives, and none of them had a word to say.",
"But I did not like to ask him how he managed to get invited.",
"The periods of rest should vary with the kind of exercise.",
"In ancient times, salt was the first thing placed on the table and the last removed.",
"Cooking answers most important purposes in connection with our food, especially from its influence upon health.",
"Rest, even for a few minutes, should be taken before eating a full meal.",
"The continuous line around border represents the free edge.",
"Each part of this system has its own characteristic cell.",
"This is especially true during recovery from illness.",
"Try to force air through the nose.",
"Make a drawing of a red heart on a bright blue ground.",
"Note the force required to pull the legs to the ordinary position.",
"He was now alone with her, and it was almost the first time he had been so, except when they ran up the hill together, since the day they met.",
"I shall not repeat their dialogue.",
"This was a severe blow to his family.",
"The waters, of course, are not very deep.",
"What a curious plant it is!",
"Early as it is, the greater part of the flowers are already expanded.",
"But when she was at the top of the hill she could not see it.",
"I was not afraid when they near put me, and the bed under me, out through the roof.",
"I wrote all this years ago, out of what were even then old memories.",
"The small hand came out of the hill.",
"What if his silver and gold are more?",
"As there was a sufficient supply of grass and water, remained at the camp to rest the party.",
"Had his parents lived to see what I have seen of him, they would have been mad indeed.",
"Now have I foundation to go upon in my terms.",
"Then shall I be in hopes of building on a good foundation.",
"For there was magic in this day that had started so badly.",
"I say that we give her no chance to escape.",
"She was the first to try the hill.",
"Soon the girl turned and ran away up the hill.",
"And when the game was ended she invited them to a dance that very night.",
"What blow can she arrest?",
"They went into the hall, through the front door.",
"It was a rather curious country in several ways.",
"Then a remarkable thing happened.",
"But subjects must not choose what king they list.",
"My master bad me cry, and I will cry till he bid me leave.",
"A silly man, good master.",
"The king!",
"What, not a king?",
"I never knew a subject love king more.",
"It is curious what little things influence the trend of human lives.",
"I prefer to keep my own counsel.",
"In the hall was a light and a woman.",
"Yet it seemed the only possible way of escape.",
"This suggested to me a way of escape.",
"If ever he were captured it might be used against him.",
"I must be killed at once, and then the spell would be removed.",
"The king went.",
"She was followed in a short while by the king, to whom the whole incident had been reported.",
"A boat would put off to the rescue.",
"Her husband followed her, with a curious look in his eyes.",
"But first he took counsel with his brother and his friends.",
"He caused his folk to rest them the night, and in the morning arm them for the battle.",
"He could have but little trust in his king, if he would not return for a space.",
"The king sat down without the town.",
"Not a man or woman remained that day in his chamber.",
"He was managing the affair well, he thought.",
"The dance hall!",
"No blow or shot followed the action.",
"She was still mad at him.",
"Then another bit of grass and flowers.",
"He grew more and more curious, he could not tell why.",
"He only knew that in a minute more the water, which had been fresh, turned salt all round him.",
"My dear child, what a silly notion!",
"The chocolate was in eggs, not in bars.",
"Lack of space, lack of facilities for moving about the ship, lack of any regular routine.",
"Had our remarkable friend his agents among them too?",
"From that moment her spell over me was broken, and we became friends.",
"The men turned round, or were pushed round.",
"A newly married couple are invited to a wedding dinner.",
"And at this point I had a brilliant idea.",
"And what a remarkable affair that was!",
"That was certainly an error of judgment.",
"There is nothing remarkable in that.",
"And I wanted a friend badly just now.",
"This was very remarkable.",
"Hence but little account should be made of pain and suffering, or even of death.",
"Since then the music has not been very brilliant.",
"Not too thick.",
"No excuse sufficient but poverty.",
"Regular seasons for nursing.",
"Every one is ready to admit the importance of being constantly employed.",
"A remarkable boy!",
"I mean to be a king in this earth.",
"If the case was beyond his power to decide, he could decline to give judgment.",
"When he became a political leader, a man of influence with the great, his presents were enormous.",
"But for her he would have ruled the world.",
"The same causes have greatly reduced the independence of personal and family life.",
"The exercise of such a power would strike at the very foundation of our system of government.",
"He began with comedy, and his comedy was a failure.",
"I began to have them constantly in my company.",
"Hearing this dialogue, I also continued becoming more and more tired of existence.",
"What is the king!",
"I am king of myself!",
"She was by this time curious.",
"It would not pass the first rough joint.",
"At those words, I thought my legs would have given way under me.",
"It may be thought a very curious affair, though I believe there is little about it that is original or new.",
"Allow me to expand a little.",
"He had worked out the rules for determining this point.",
"The first was built with a wide hall running from one end to the other.",
"It was meal time.",
"It is not a matter of surprise that a severe illness followed.",
"But the year was now drawing to a close.",
"Learning is ever curious.",
"All these things can be purchased for little more than a song, and when needed they are needed badly.",
"It seemed as if the city had been held in check and was now released to express itself in its own characteristic way.",
"Until she came, a son had never failed under that roof.",
"Now we have lost not only our independence, but our very identity.",
"Had he been under a spell?",
"It seemed to her as if she had only to stretch out her hand to touch them.",
"She was there near him under the same roof.",
"But the spell of her beauty is upon him.",
"Was he mad?",
"All made a pretty picture, though curious.",
"On every island stands a king!",
"But they checked all expression of their feelings.",
"Even quite little children are subject to it, but they never have it badly.",
"Several other clubs signed, and received their money.",
"But their memories remain.",
"The snow fell fast and thick.",
"The time was drawing near for his return.",
"They will not kill and eat me, nor take my eggs.",
"It was a very pretty little nose.",
"Her husband came to the rescue.",
"The boy who did the drawing given above is not likely to produce good work in later life.",
"No matter what the burden, there always has been, and always must be, a way for us also to escape.",
"The man, it seems, will escape.",
"My mother she bid me light him to bed.",
"The body lay upon its back, the legs wide apart.",
"King say.",
"I can judge from his manner if he thinks me mad.",
"Under what awful spell did I exist?",
"It will be most acceptable.",
"The county folk near were by themselves.",
"He was right, for the love of the beautiful cannot long exist where there is moral pollution.",
"The curious thing was that he assumed it to himself.",
"He is rough, it is true, but he knows the shop.",
"There will be no crew.",
"They were on the home stretch.",
"To go in swimming one must take off his clothes.",
"Too thick to see anything.",
"They were both men of remarkable learning.",
"This text is treated in a manner characteristic of the age.",
"Nor can salt water produce fresh.",
"He might have been king had he lived.",
"In the clubs the possibility of her telling was of more moment.",
"Sometimes I think he was the most brilliant man I have ever known.",
"And the times and seasons of weather and life turn with it.",
"Her husband followed and both appeared swimming beyond the wave they had lost.",
"This seemed all very acceptable.",
"How strange the landscape seems!",
"Let it turn on matters that lie outside the dark chamber, upon the last new discovery, or the last new idea.",
"She was a remarkable girl.",
"I could not escape by the passage, and dropped out of the window into the area with him in my arms.",
"How trouble tries words!",
"That is remarkable!",
"How strange it is to return to a familiar chamber after a great event has happened!",
"The result of the election was curious.",
"I lay on his little bed, in the chamber in the wall, till I could again walk.",
"Long did the king argue on.",
"Not one shall escape!",
"Then I saw a signal being given, and knew they were going to blow up the ship.",
"It was a sight for a king.",
"The whole country is mad with green.",
"We have found a house up the hill, close to the town, an excellent place though very, very little.",
"Come, let us take counsel together and make some!",
"Studio work is the real touch.",
"When they are all on their legs this will make an excellent collection.",
"But I have written a good few since, and the spell is broken.",
"It was like having an illness.",
"I am quite mad over it.",
"I was so happy on board that ship, I could not have believed it possible.",
"Well, then, what is curious?",
"Of course this is with an idea of a novel, but in the course of it I made a very curious discovery.",

"A room, hall.",
"To blow.",
"Branch of a tree.",
"Cut away, run hard, escape.",
"She conducted me to a small house, some little way up the hill.",
"I will print the paragraph in red.",
"Expand both these functions.",
"Is there but one day of judgment?",
"And there are curious moral and religious questions connected with these.",
"And I wanted to have a sight of this poverty of which I had been told.",
"I pushed my way to the table.",
"Mother and daughter were living in the greatest poverty.",
"Still more remarkable were my relations to the children.",
"It seems to us, that suffering stands apart by itself, and our life apart by itself.",
"Indeed, it is only a short step from writing to drawing.",
"Not a foreign ship visited the port either last year or this.",
"I have several times been asked to write something to be thus displayed.",
"Because they are so cheap they are very badly used."],

["Of the practices of the females, something will be said in particular in a future chapter.",
"It was rather difficult to get seats.",
"Whenever a letter came asking for money, she had the case investigated, and if the story was true, gave practical help at once.",
"He said it was quite possible and then gave me various instructions.",
"Some of these I look back to with much pleasure.",
"The view was lovely as we looked down from our seats.",
"The doors were always open, and one had a lovely view of green fields and trees.",
"Now the shops in all the small country towns have improved.",
"Let him be turned out of doors.",
"The words spring up and bring forth fruit.",
"They involve the intense and complicated action of many and of complex powers.",
"The race has demands upon her, as well as her own child.",
"They found no difficulty in making the purchase.",
"She said she should not object, if it would gave me pleasure.",
"Here I met with a difficulty which I had not expected.",
"Why do I take such pleasure in the mere words which I am now setting down?",
"I shall begin by describing her.",
"Also the game suits me.",
"Then the assistant returned to me.",
"The sand had completely run out of him.",
"The mere fact of his own belief in what he said came to matter little.",
"The crew never threatened me by word or look.",
"There we were again, back to the old difficulty, only worse.",
"He was answered from miles away down the lake by another.",
"Cover and let brown a few minutes.",
"Let get light brown on top.",
"Now this strikes us as very good policy.",
"His object in coming here was grand, unusual and romantic.",
"The sea was just as smooth as glass!",
"This subject should certainly be investigated.",
"Both these doors were made of glass.",
"I opened the doors and went inside.",
"Out of this circle the eye looked at me.",
"This is absolutely necessary, as the natural soil is such that no permanent structure can be put up otherwise.",
"That was exactly the difficulty.",
"She had no heart, however, for anything, and did not even make any attempt to prepare a meal for her husband.",
"But his greatest pleasure was the study of people.",
"He had met her at a studio at a time when he had thought of studying art seriously.",
"Blue, or brown, or what?",
"But it so happened that it was engaged.",
"She was really pleased at this, and held out her hand.",
"There they saw beautiful birds of many bright colors, and beautiful flowers of all kinds.",
"They spend their lives in fighting, dancing, and drinking.",
"Men and women gave gifts of money for the work.",
"Boys and girls brought their little gifts, too.",
"It was painted in bright colors.",
"There were beautiful plants and flowers of many colors.",
"No one answered.",
"When the chief and his men were ready to leave, everyone was excited.",
"There were no windows or doors in the building.",
"They came often to visit her and brought her gifts.",
"Now she was beginning all over in a new territory.",
"He has come out to smell the earth.",
"I strain my neck to the point of breaking.",
"At the meeting he spoke a little, and pleased the people.",
"Hardly had they got through one difficulty than they were into another.",
"The difficulty of getting sufficient food to eat was very real.",
"But there was a good deal of difficulty in the way to begin with.",
"She would not smile.",
"Once I answered an ad.",
"The following morning, however, the mystery was explained.",
"There were beautiful long hits, which threatened to change the outcome of games and some of them did.",
"He went out, closing the door.",
"I am not for a moment suggesting that as an explanation of the mystery.",
"The mystery is made clear.",
"He was looking up now and saw the intense relief in her face.",
"The summer of that year was an exciting period in the history of the new territory.",
"I then managed to make him understand that I was there alone and having broken my leg, I had sent my partner off for a team to take me away.",
"My wood was mostly under the snow, and it was with great difficulty that I could get enough to start a fire with.",
"Flowers, the assistant division agent.",
"This kind of fighting was all new to me, being entirely different from any in which I had ever before engaged.",
"It is to be very select.",
"There was something about the work which pleased him.",
"It was beautiful to be able to give pleasure to people.",
"There was a great deal at stake.",
"But one of the boys was not pleased.",
"Well, I should smile.",
"He could smell them.",
"Nobody answered.",
"But she will smile no more!",
"Yes, yes, what should I deliver else?",
"He discovered something in the sand that interested him.",
"We served his pleasure.",
"It is not so easy to sum up the requirements of a human soul.",
"Then we took the babies for a walk.",
"Children generally know that tiny babies can hold very tight, and have various ideas for the mother.",
"It is my belief that the greatest finds of gold will be made in this territory.",
"Provisions were almost at an end.",
"The financial side was one difficulty.",
"That was all they could do for themselves and their flag.",
"But one and all were held by the dancing eyes of the man that spoke.",
"He came to my house in the evening just after the closing of the store.",
"Without him I must have been a mere child.",
"Then suddenly our mood changed.",
"Each man to his own path, but I would ours had run together.",
"Wake up!",
"The mere fact of living was enough for her.",
"And there the paper was found, in the most natural way, without any trouble or mystery at all.",
"And then we must all live our lives, they in their way, we in ours.",
"It is a mystery.",
"She looked at him with such wondering eyes that he answered her without a word.",
"He called us and we answered not.",
"I was glad to be free from them, to be left to myself, to get a little pleasure perhaps like the others.",
"I felt that there was pleasure in being left alone.",
"He only answered with a laugh.",
"His smile did not please me.",
"Yet when I turned to her, she made an effort to smile.",
"I answered like a child, upon his last word.",
"We could keep the path without difficulty as we went along.",
"They saw there was some mystery in it.",
"It was not my own trouble, and I answered it in the conventional way.",
"It gave him, I think, a certain pleasure to think that he had the only picture.",
"It had been with difficulty that I had kept myself still.",
"I had my message to deliver.",
"And dancing choice!",
"Difficulty is to keep him from murder!",
"It means the application of the mind to the thing in which we are engaged.",
"Attention may be either external or internal.",
"It was kept in different places at different dates.",
"Provisions, that should have been with the column the night before, arrived in the morning.",
"Our men never answered.",
"They were once more under the flag.",
"I will go back and select the men.",
"She is somewhat excited.",
"He moved his left leg.",
"And sleep is life to him, so wake him not.",
"While they have employment, many of them do not themselves work, but spend their lives in watching machines work.",
"I determined to stake some claims and work them.",
"Whom should I select?",
"From the moment he entered the house the night before he had been a mystery.",
"They might almost have been blood brothers, except for differences in the face.",
"In the morning, at the first touch of light, he had gone to the stores and collected provisions.",
"The pleasure he took in the action of the animal kept him from getting into his problem.",
"In a word, they did not like him because he made a mystery of himself.",
"And she could appreciate now, for the first time, that he was smaller than he had seemed at a distance, or while he was dancing.",
"It may have been a smile that she gave him.",
"And now he sat at a distance looking at her with the white, intense face of one who sees a dream.",
"The dancing stopped, of course.",
"But the other continued to smile.",
"He could show a dozen colors in as many moments.",
"I asked myself the same question before I answered.",
"In a word, what was all this mystery about?",
"The gold was all gone from the earth, and from her mood as well.",
"She had promised him the flowers, and he would be pleased with them.",
"Always and always she was looking beyond the mere present moment.",
"They were painted in red, black, and green colors.",
"Great men in other countries were pleased with his books.",
"The doors were opened.",
"The picture of the baby pleased his mother when she saw it.",
"They showed him how to make red and yellow colors for himself.",
"She was too much pleased with the picture he was making.",
"It pleased him to learn things.",
"But the master told him he was pleased to find that he liked to read such good books.",
"He could not see whether the flag was still flying or not.",
"There was a flag flying over it.",
"Many a time he had to sleep out of doors.",
"Once he turned dancing master for a while.",
"The brothers talked about it all night.",
"Great men of one kind are known only in new countries like ours.",
"She wanted to get money to send her little brothers to school.",
"She wanted to help her brothers.",
"She was able to send her brothers to school until they grew up.",
"Besides helping her brothers, she wanted to help other poor children.",
"We must not be a mere copy of everybody else.",
"She was real excited.",
"But we do not normally meet words, any more than we meet men, in the domestic circle.",
"Brown left all his property to his family.",
"To repair the one we must at the same time repair the other.",
"What are the primary colors?",
"They kick about it of course.",
"His plans were full of energy, and the principles which inspired them looked beyond the consequences of the hour.",
"This mystery they soon found out.",
"In this situation I continued for some years, after which my master put me to work out of doors.",
"I answered him that I would.",
"But he refused and answered that he must have my labor this summer, as he did not have it the past winter.",
"The note was short and not romantic.",
"He was poor and not romantic.",
"He could, however, play up to her later mood, and when they set off he began to joke.",
"Then he looked at his watch, but his chair was deep and when he tried to get up his leg hurt.",
"Moreover, since she came home she had felt she was being watched, and, so to speak, protected from herself.",
"Brown would need him now.",
"If I was caught I could tell a romantic story about the girl who helped me get off.",
"Brown indicated the objects.",
"It is the color of colors.",
"These bring out its colors.",
"Results had not pleased me.",
"The root of this is the failure to fully understand and count the cost, and to prepare to meet it as men generally do in the management of their common affairs.",
"Ours are thus free.",
"But there is no need of finding a difficulty in this fact, or of seeking far for an explanation of it.",
"If that was so, how came the chair to tip the way it did?",
"Money is the soil of power.",
"Everybody was pleased.",
"Were we transformed?",
"Many persons who were mere names to the majority of the public are here, for the first time, recognized as men engaged in living lives as well as in writing books.",
"Women are supposed to have liked to serve for mere love of service, for love of child, love of husband.",
"He engaged a man.",
"The doors stand wide open.",
"There he made a mark in the sand with his foot.",
"That officer went back to the house with a pleased smile on his features.",
"I understand there are some attractive points of mystery in the crime.",
"Communications of the kind had to be made by signs.",
"He was pleased at the meeting, but I was not pleased.",
"Was it the smell?",
"We have been engaged for a year.",
"It was the nature of these objects which made the mystery.",
"A violent change in the patient had occurred.",
"It was a kind word he had or a smile.",
"I believe I answered.",
"It was the smile which runs before a promise.",
"With the coming on of night, my mood changed.",
"I was engaged in a mean act.",
"She would not want me long, and very soon I could go back and have as good a time as I pleased.",
"He could smell it in the air.",
"He could still smell the camp when he lay down.",
"It was the intense cold.",
"And it pleased him, too.",
"But it was not the game smell.",
"That which was in the air was no longer a mystery to him.",
"The kick had completed his first education.",
"It would cost them some labor to repair the damage he did, but there was plenty of food and it was warm.",
"The work of repair was begun at once.",
"At last only occasionally did he find colors.",
"He picked it up from where he had dropped it in the sand.",
"Then it entered the port and ran up a red flag.",
"The first of the brothers was recommended to him.",
"There was nothing else but some simple gifts.",
"Let us try to sum them up.",
"And wake him it did.",
"They looked very much pleased with their boy.",
"As I look back, nothing strikes me so greatly as the length of the way by which I have come.",
"But I continued my play as though I had not seen him, and for some time he stood watching us with a dry smile.",
"The lesson I was to profit by was that I should stand no chance against him.",
"They were dead before they knew that danger threatened.",
"But if I can feel no pain, how can I feel any pleasure?",
"It is an intense study of one great situation, with little plot, little construction, little or no relief or variety.",
"And dramatically they are most important.",
"And now we come to the last act of the great drama.",
"It is an old story and an old difficulty.",
"If that question is a difficulty, other means must be employed.",
"Their line of communications was very bad.",
"They never asked for news, but were content to wait till they could tell the public that victory was ours.",
"An advance must slow down while communications were improved.",
"But it was all a mystery.",
"He refused to wake.",
"In the latter incident there was a deep mystery.",
"The woman sitting before me was herself a mystery.",
"I therefore at once saw a difficulty.",
"What was the mystery surrounding her?",
"He has just threatened to kill me!",
"I tried all sorts of ways to get rid of them.",
"Conversation, in the sense of a mere flow of talk, is never difficult with newspaper men.",
"The village was only just ours.",
"What drama is complete without a lady in it?",
"He still seemed to be near me, still seemed to be watching me with his cool half smile.",
"I always seek profit and pleasure.",
"It seems to me I remember that a similar sum once passed between us.",
"One has threatened me with death.",
"People have threatened me too often.",
"It was relief, perhaps, that made her smile at us.",
"I was glad it was too dark for him to see my smile.",
"But please set aside any notion of us as likely to become engaged.",
"Grant was not so pleased.",
"In fact, it suits our plans.",
"The small circle round about him believed that the equal of the boy did not exist upon the earth.",
"Distance and difficulty, and in early times danger too, keep many people away.",
"But he answered her not a word.",
"Again, I say, this is a great mystery.",
"Believe me, my dear friends, this is no mere theory.",
"They are no concern of ours, and besides they will not hurt us.",
"This is the lesson of life.",
"It appears that they not only lived to an extreme old age, but at the last were transformed into trees.",
"Even here, however, only the eastern end is ancient.",
"I wish that I might have seen it, for it would have pleased me.",
"The eastern arm was, however, different.",
"Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?",
"The man accepted relief for one week, but after that, he declined receiving it any longer, because he had met with a promise of employment.",
"On our way I noticed again some features of street life which are more common in manufacturing towns just now than when times are good.",
"I had met him for a few minutes once before, so there was no difficulty between us.",
"What if I do smile?",
"Will he expect me to smile every day?",
"But from now on I will smile more often.",
"The limits of territory assigned to each of the parties were not made clear.",
"The cold was intense.",
"And to her these were no mere words of a song.",
"We come now to describe the closing months of this devoted life.",
"I know the mystery well!",
"They just knew the names, but no more, and were pleased to listen while I related the story.",
"This was to be answered before the next meeting.",
"Having heard that a man living near had broken his leg, she drove off at once to visit him, and repeated her visits weekly.",
"She gave a strange little smile.",
"The vision made her smile, as well it might.",
"Mother is afraid to go out of doors for fear of infection.",
"Then she went out, without waiting for an answer, closing the door behind her.",
"He was one of the few men who could see that smile and be strong.",
"Brothers, that man must not leave this room alive.",
"In one place it was stained with red.",
"The doors close on them.",
"It was harder work, because every lesson had to be studied by the teacher, and in a different way from what was thought good enough in the old days.",
"I make a trip to see them and the babies about once a year.",
"And the call could be answered.",
"When done on one side, turn and brown them on the other.",
"The leg.",
"The neck.",
"A high raised appearance should be given to the fruit, which is done in the following manner.",
"Receiving, as she often will, instructions from the doctor, she should bear these in mind, and carefully carry them out.",
"This gas gives out no smell, so that we cannot know of its presence.",
"And not only do birds of the same kind associate, but certain species are almost always found together.",
"She realized, though, that she had to put off further communications for a quiet evening hour.",
"That suits us exactly, for he must not hear us.",
"Never has anybody been so nice and pleased us so.",
"By this he meant to show that no one could easily go in again at his pleasure.",
"Up with the black flag!",
"I had helped prepare the news for the press and followed the forms to the press room.",
"Quite a large sum was realized.",
"Their shots were thick and fast and told with telling effect.",
"We must put excited feelings away.",
"Any nation other than ours would have gone to war in a moment over such a blow in the face.",
"They began to try chance shots to the right and to the left.",
"The smell of fresh, warm blood was thick on the air.",
"The great drama is ended.",
"All the air was filled with the sweet smell of good things cooking.",
"Come, brothers, all together!",
"Our task in the way of describing town society will soon be ended.",
"She answered that she did, a little.",
"Horrible, indeed, it looked, as though stained with blood.",
"His instructions to them were that they should not go to a greater distance than that they might return in the course of the same evening, and that they should not separate from one another.",
"She is tied to the stake, and must fight the course.",
"He would smile and sit still.",
"He was said to be a political agent of sorts, but he certainly learned nothing in conversation.",
"He brought them to terms partly by force, as they did but little, and partly by the fear which the capture of some inspired.",
"They answered him at random.",
"I know not whether my readers can understand the full difficulty and danger of the situation.",
"The powers can be investigated, their conditions of action laid down.",
"But father is in bad mood.",
"These were not random shots.",
"She put her arms around his neck.",
"However long he lived, his life must necessarily be transformed from contact with those great men.",
"That transformed him!",
"But he heard no shots.",
"He felt the closing of the hand which was not there.",
"These contain the daily bills, letters, and papers, as they come in and are answered in order.",
"In some of the rooms paintings are on the walls above the doors.",
"I was a mere girl then, and everything seemed wonderful.",
"He will surely bear back with him a great sum.",
"I have seen him kill just for the pleasure of it.",
"I called assistance, and, with much difficulty, we brought him to himself.",
"There was no dancing that night.",
"She tried to smile.",
"She could not have helped the smile or its message.",
"For so she was pleased to consider him lower in the scale than herself.",
"For a long time he stood, studying it, seeking to make sure.",
"I figure that we ought to take no more long shots than we have to.",
"And in her heart she knew that here was but the mere truth.",
"His mood was not so soon for a woman.",
"Having therefore arrived thus far, let us here rest for a while, and consider with ourselves, whether being is the investigated principle of all things.",
"It must be a happy mystery.",
"By night there will be dancing, and such music!",
"Brothers in arms!",
"His drama is absolutely wonderful.",
"I guess the sand man has been here.",
"She was much excited.",
"Enough pleasure and beauty, enough music and fun and good times!",
"There was always a way around a difficulty.",
"His voice was thick, and the words came with difficulty.",
"She made her decision without any difficulty.",
"They were in the mood now to laugh at anything she said.",
"He was elected in one of the city seats, and we are all so glad.",
"I do not know what he means by that, but when he says it people always look at me and smile.",
"I said I was not pleased with the way in which they were living.",
"A child can learn many a lesson from a dog.",
"Later on, they turned out to be a pretty brown.",
"It had a nice, strong smell.",
"I did not smell them.",
"I knew by the smell.",
"Every part of the little house was almost as light as it was out doors, on account of the large windows.",
"The last time that we knew of his coming to the village was to draw quite a sum of money from the bank.",
"On one side there was a smooth wall of rock, many feet deep.",
"So the lower parts of the walls were stained a dark, brown color.",
"Just think how he has loved and protected me.",
"Wood hard at work under the fruit trees.",
"There was a noise of excited speaking in the hall.",
"She had cast an arm about his neck.",
"Every separate bone in his neck was hot with pain.",
"But how shall we learn science by mere common sense?",
"Now for the soil of the field.",
"Then look for a field in which the soil is still being made.",
"I do not say that these changes were sudden or violent.",
"They have been killed by the sand.",
"He will begin to recognize and know his parents, smile and play.",
"But with the sexual life came a conflict for sex pleasure, a competition among members of the same species for the same individual as their sex partners.",
"What and where is the romantic object?",
"They are the oldest seats of feeling, thought and will and continue to function as such.",
"For in the wake of chemical discovery there has always come chemical control.",
"Why, the mere fact that he was lost did not cut any figure in the matter when so many more terrible things might have happened to him.",
"So do a lot of ours.",
"He is not the select man of the whole nation.",
"The only way to that reality is through the direct participation of the nation as a whole in the settlement, and that is possible only through the direct election for this particular issue of representative and responsible men.",
"This means something more than a restriction of state forces.",
"Life is going to be very intense in the years ahead of us.",
"When she runs up her flag.",
"Go wake him, go wake him.",
"A chip of the old block.",
"A tree is known by its fruit.",
"One good turn demands another.",
"God wrote the drama which men have to play.",
"As soon as I saw where he was headed for, I just beat it back.",
"He was all excited when he talked, and I could see he was just crazy about those new plans.",
"If that smile had been any longer it would have cut his head off.",
"Oil continued to rain down as they headed toward the north.",
"The day following was one of intense, almost complicated routine.",
"The kick for goal failed.",
"The matter will be investigated further.",
"A smile went around the table.",
"I set myself to reading and studying.",
"It seems a long time to wait, but I am studying at home.",
"Give me words to speak, and prepare his heart to listen.",
"He ran forward, and so did his brothers.",
"He looked at his brothers, and saw that they, too, were out of sorts.",
"And then he and his brothers retired.",
"They quickly distributed the gifts they had brought and then looked at their own.",
"That was the lesson which they had to learn, and to teach other nations also.",
"And we, too, need the same lesson in these scientific days.",
"But here, in this lesson, is a proof of the truth of what I said.",
"There was another mystery.",
"They were taking the lesson to heart.",
"Added to this was another difficulty.",
"He grew excited.",
"I shot him through the left leg.",
"Suddenly the boy became excited.",
"He could walk where he pleased, following his own sweet will, or else he could stand still.",
"Then he made himself smile.",
"And suppose he were to wake up?",
"What he demands is the heart.",
"Out of this mood he failed to laugh himself.",
"The fall should have broken his neck.",
"How romantic!",
"If there are questions to be asked, save them until I wake up.",
"Without his participation the discussion continued.",
"It is the mere effect of growth.",
"He did not seem at all pleased at having met her.",
"But she has only just arrived, otherwise she would probably have been engaged already.",
"And, in addition, I am engaged for the whole afternoon.",
"He then gave her very clear instructions.",
"The big brothers were too late!",
"The peace of my home is at stake.",
"They tell every thing dramatically.",
"If I have convinced the reader of this he will, I think, feel no difficulty in following me to a further conclusion.",
"My brothers are too hot.",
"What mystery is this?",
"Finally I decided to stake everything on what appeared to be my only chance.",
"We were all too excited to sleep.",
"On that particular night, for the first time, sleep refused to come, late as was the hour when the family circle broke up.",
"They run this concern to make money, and they want some of ours.",
"They may be members of the last named and serve as judges.",
"It was protected from the wind on all sides.",
"These questions can not be answered with a simple yes or no.",
"The doors stood open night and day.",
"There is a sort of strain and mystery which I cannot define.",
"I have seen doors like that before.",
"It was a road that needed continuous watching and repair.",
"But neither answered her.",
"He had answered the question which she was too proud to ask.",
"There was no flag there.",
"They seem engaged in their proper element.",
"It can smile no longer.",
"The sun has no purposes of ours to light us to.",
"There was one man whose progress in wealth I watched with much interest and pleasure.",
"And now the time arrived that our domestic circle was again to be broken up.",
"One would think I had not got my lesson today.",
"Real safety and apparent danger have each their share in the pleasure felt.",
"Yet pleasure it is, and I almost think the greatest I ever enjoyed.",
"So far the story is romantic enough, and what follows is hardly less so.",
"In fact, girls and boys of that age are supposed to spend their time studying what other people write.",
"It was an experience learning to plan my day properly and I would feel quite pleased with myself when I got things right on my own.",
"I arrived there without any difficulty.",
"Many of the boys were studying at night school and working here during the day.",
"All sorts of strange things kept happening one after another.",
"I was so excited and happy.",
"Then one of the students introduced me to the audience and I was called up to the stage to deliver my speech.",
"The passage, however, is not always smooth.",
"If the means were violent, the end was great.",
"This, perhaps, is too large a sum.",
"Towns and cities of the coast.",
"We have briefly to notice the remaining towns and cities of the interior, with some other remarkable places.",
"The air is pure, and provisions are excellent.",
"The dates have been coming in to a great amount.",
"The progress which the understanding makes through a book, has more pain than pleasure in it.",
"But the reading lesson continued.",
"It was not possible to suppose that any one could feel, in a state which she had left, that interest which good work demands.",
"I wake up talking of him, out of the little sleep I do get.",
"How I had come by my own mind copy of it was a mystery to me beyond solution.",
"Then I told her the considerable sum now to her credit.",
"I had seen her smile before, but never before had she seen me at those times.",
"I am very much pleased.",
"It is the key to the whole mystery.",
"Now there was no mystery at all.",
"It slides toward the front.",
"No one answered, for here was another mystery.",
"In times like that men talk like brothers and show what they are.",
"Such things had been, and she was in a mood to believe anything.",
"But this campaign is far different from any of the others in which our arms are at present engaged.",
"Each sought those who engaged him in the service.",
"Still none answered.",
"The only change was in the character of the judges, and in that of the accused.",
"It is not to be supposed that the mother and child held any open communications with each other to this effect.",
"It was a pleasure to her to do so.",
"Because every man believes just what it suits him to believe.",
"It seemed to be their only notion of the romantic.",
"It is a cause which demands support that is strong enough to bring about substantial justice.",
"Well there was no mystery about it.",
"I repeat we cannot deliver our land through violence.",
"The man who has inspired confidence in another has never lost anything in this world.",
"That is a difficulty from without and easier to deal with.",
"It merely points out the difficulty.",
"We must treat them as our brothers and give them the same rights that we claim for ourselves.",

"What pleasure should I have in breaking such a spirit!",
"I would see him in the morning as early as he pleased.",

"But I like brown.",
"And now they shall never get me back behind doors again.",
"His first lesson was quite a success.",
"There was something of a mystery about her.",
"Clearly the mystery over her past had made an impression on the character of this sweet, quiet girl.",
"Then I must have gotten excited in my dream.",
"He had been so excited while they were talking that he had been hardly able to lie still.",
"Good pleasure, stay.",
"Is the field ours?",

"It was no mere accident.",
"But man is more than the fruit of a tree.",
"All the doors were open at the house.",
"She looked up, and tried to smile.",
"So let us sit down in a circle and tell stories.",
"Passing wide and deep is this fair mere.",

"But the dead man answered never a word.",
"It would have been a positive pleasure.",
"They always liked to stretch the time, and give the territory a good run for her money.",
"It takes all sorts, they say, to make a world.",

"It is threatened now, very seriously.",
"Is this dancing?",
"There certainly ought to be no difficulty in identifying the body.",
"The will contains no instructions to that effect.",
"I therefore assumed an air of mystery.",
"I was very pleased with the position they have given to the exhibit, and so would my poor old friend have been.",
"His great gifts and learning, however, did not allow him to remain without public employment.",
"Thus he must be made the mere text of a great subject.",
"The males have separate places and so have the females.",
"The seats are all well made and all open.",
"Yes, and it was a difficulty.",
"The seats are strong, broad, and regular in shape.",
"Color of females.",
"Fruit before breakfast.",
"Bad seats for children at table and elsewhere.",
"It was once said by the author of a huge volume, that he wrote so large a work because he had not time to prepare a smaller one.",
"Let us look at females around us generally.",
"There is a very great diversity of opinion on the subject of fruit.",
"On several points, in regard to fruit, I believe that among medical men there is no essential difference of opinion.",
"Least of all ought the difficulty of keeping them clean, to move them from the path of duty.",
"I answer, it is relief from the employment of thinking.",
"The same results would follow from cutting up even the whole of a large county, or a small state, into towns.",
"The seats of children are usually bad, both at table and elsewhere.",
"He answered to both names.",
"External heat and cold had little influence on him.",
"All therefore gave themselves up to pleasure.",
"The house was built upon the sand.",
"It is something more than the employment of experts in legislation.",
"Every one of these provisions has a history.",
"To think on this, may pleasure be perhaps another day.",
"As for others, they are to be answered by that one sentence of an ancient author.",
"If he had pleased, he could have made it anything!",
"But this is no business of ours.",
"We use it for a while with pleasure.",
"He assumed them under circumstances by which he and his party and the whole country had been taught a great lesson of political duty.",
"It is my pleasure to be kind.",
"I have lived out of doors since.",
"Boxes like this are usually heavy.",
"He gave them one look, and, closing his eyes, did not open them again while they remained in the room.",
"The bill had been passed without debate in the closing moments of the session.",
"The success of the first cable inspired others.",
"As the day passed his hope began to fall, as there seemed little possibility that the judges would reach his exhibit.",
"These instructions were more easily given than observed.",
"In this duty they served by turns, but neither of them had any provisions.",
"It is also a pleasure to know with what views they look back upon the past.",
"But as another charge was now growing up in the southern part of the city, it is proper that I should refer to it before closing this chapter.",
"He loved the work in which he was engaged, and was very generally popular among the people.",
"During the winter his wife, who was a lady of fine culture, taught a select school in the village.",
"The year now closing had been full of work.",
"Windows were rising, and doors opening.",
"Sea completely smooth, but cold.",
"This was a break that no man could repair on the road.",
"At one time or another each made a mile a minute, and a much higher rate of speed would have been maintained throughout had it not been necessary to identify certain towns in passing.",
"Even the great doors were closed.",
"The men circle round him.",
"Wake up, man!",
"Still there was a mystery.",
"But she must deliver her message.",
"He can with difficulty keep his hands off him!",
"My brothers, I should think so!",
"So then the mystery was out.",
"Old enough to miss what had pleased them, till something else pleased them as well.",
"Can they both be men and brothers?",
"We shall have them beginning to turn, soon, with a smooth sound.",
"This wall is not external.",
"I am sure it was with pleasure.",
"Behind the church there is a level piece of ground with a table and stone seats round it.",
"It does seem rather a small sum certainly.",
"I shall never forget the pleasure with which I first came upon it.",
"But she had now a soft smile.",
"He checked himself in time from so expressing his question, but she answered as if she had heard the words.",
"When it was barely above the surface I set a stake into the soil a yard away.",
"Corresponding windows above, not protected, serve to admit light and rain to the rooms of the upper floor.",
"I was not particularly well pleased to hear it now.",
"For unless the exact nature of the difficulty be known first, who can attempt to remove it?",
"The difficulty with his hands and legs increased.",
"The law is also external.",
"She never answered him when he was angry with her.",
"He went home to his dinner excited, and he was dangerous.",
"He stopped and seemed to wake up suddenly.",
"And ours is a good one.",
"This circle looked always the same.",
"The mystery was mystery no longer.",
"But it is nothing compared with the displays of which he is capable.",
"Coming off to us was a boat, flying a yellow flag.",
"It was flying a red flag.",
"A narrow place where the sea ran smooth appeared.",
"Who will deliver me from this body of death?",
"So called she to me across that circle of the drinking.",
"The sight of the sand on it made me sick for the second time.",
"And he was engaged to be married.",
"It is the same in country towns, allowing for the different statistics of the population.",
"No one who has seen such a trial can fail to know, or can ever forget, its intense interest.",
"It is strange that without any external circumstances to account for it, she and I often thought the same things at the same moment.",
"No wonder he was excited!",
"The large free way of doing things here is everywhere a pleasure.",
"The man raised his head, looked him full in the face, but neither answered nor made any further movement.",
"We own that ours do not lie very deep.",
"It is surprising how it suits me, and how happy I keep.",
"There is not much pleasure in life certainly as it stands at present.",
"In neither mood can a man judge at all.",
"What a romantic drama!",
"The mystery of his life is great.",
"Was I well inspired?",
"If I did well there, we might then meet and do what should most smile at the time.",
"He is one of those who can make a noise of his own with words, and in whom experience strikes an individual note.",
"This is a rather large order, and demands some explanation.",
"Up, up, brothers!",
"Both these brothers are highly remarkable men.",
"That was the first mystery of life to me.",
"Is not this a mystery of life?",
"This is one lesson.",
"Teach us the lesson of the trees.",
"Pleasure is the only thing one should live for.",
"I have not seen anything which has pleased me more."],

"The new hands house and feed themselves.",
"If the murder was committed late at night how came it that there were no lights in the empty house when the police discovered the body?",
"He was there only a few minutes when he saw the lights go out.",
"But none of these men were likely to take the papers, and still less to know where they were hidden.",
"Of course it was not visible with his hand closed.",
"But I remembered where they could be found.",
"I remembered the spot well.",
"I had forgotten the telephone.",
"I had only forgotten.",
"It would make a difference in the reading, or rather, in the conclusions to be drawn from what remained.",
"Indeed, I had forgotten to whom I was talking.",
"Where did this bit of broken bottle come from?",
"Few men could feel differently.",
"Never from this day on shall another bottle be opened under my roof.",
"For several days I had been ill.",
"And so I have been ill!",
"No one had noticed the difference, and she had forgotten all about the matter until now.",
"His eye had just fallen on her.",
"Was I too ill to be told?",
"I remembered that moment well.",
"Neither was visible.",
"But the brother has forgotten this.",
"From far off in the plain there came a cry.",
"And then, at last, he turned and went down into the plain.",
"After a time he saw a fire in the edge of the forest.",
"He was very quiet, and she was pleased that he was still sleeping.",
"The call that came to him from over the plain was not so strong.",
"She want the forest, the wild kill, the fresh blood.",
"It was abandoned.",
"She found the fallen tree to which he had been tied.",
"They went away to a place where was sleeping the one who had taken the money.",
"They passed the night in the forest.",
"One day he fell ill.",
"Not sleeping, he had to think.",
"If he had fallen and broken his leg?",
"In this sense it is admitted to be a part of natural philosophy.",
"Their height.",
"Everything which represented the work of the past has been destroyed and they have not known how to construct anything.",
"At last the work of destruction was complete.",
"But his head had fallen back, and his eyes were closed.",
"Night had fallen.",
"I have my instruments by me.",
"And he gained another greater battle, and lost a leg.",
"When the war first broke out no one could give an adequate reason for it.",
"We may hope they will not be forgotten this time when the war is over.",
"Let not this fact be forgotten.",
"It serves nothing to ignore the fact that the moral of the troops was not high in the weeks following the second failure.",
"It was soon a most difficult task to move transport on the roads.",
"Late in the afternoon the advance was ordered to be stopped, and the positions gained to be held.",
"There had been a few days of fine weather, and a great deal had been done to improve the condition of the roads and communications.",
"The line was not gained without fighting.",
"Nobody on the roads.",
"Some, indeed, must be brought back from the fighting line for work as vital as the fighting itself.",
"Everybody is ill.",
"It means no more to them than the roads behind used to mean to us.",
"None of them can have such a thing as a nerve.",
"But we fight through it, and along the roads every one of which is famous in the history of the battle.",
"For the rare sounds in the forest were unlike any sounds he had heard before.",
"Perhaps it was a child, lost there in the forest like himself.",
"But he knew it was something big, but at so great a height from the earth as to look like a fly.",
"But he was only sleeping.",
"Mystery surrounded me on every hand.",
"My strength was failing.",
"Politics are the art of eating, drinking, sleeping, and wearing good clothes at the public expense.",
"But he gained no ground.",
"I found a wine bottle half full, and took a deep drink.",
"But this made the traffic block worse, and they had to move forward again, and the idea of getting them all together was abandoned.",
"It will not be forgotten.",
"But we gained some, useful new knowledge.",
"It seems that he expected an attack in the mountains, but not on the plain.",
"He seemed to have forgotten I was there as he continued.",
"From his manner he might have been surrounded by brilliant company.",
"I have seen too many good men go down for just that failing.",
"Even today when I look at a place that men have built and then abandoned, something of the same feeling comes over me, but not as strongly as it did that evening.",
"At any rate, he made up his mind that the course suggested by truth and honor was the only one to follow, and that, in itself, was something gained.",
"I suppose the cut is visible still?",
"He needed time to collect his thoughts.",
"There was quite a friendly argument, but he carried his point.",
"He and his mother were separated from that day of the boxes on the ear.",
"The meeting between them was friendly.",
"He said his brother was very ill, and had had a fit the day before, and it was a great question if they should see him alive.",

"But for the seeing eye it reveals, how much!",
"With the destruction of religion went the destruction of the religious houses.",
"It seems then to have been in a bad way, but later recovered.",
"The one thing we must take into consideration is the matter of roads.",
"The roads are something awful.",
"The roads were bad enough.",
"They did not move until he had gained the path and turned toward the hotel.",
"It is fallen.",
"What have I gained by health?",
"The reason why the stroke has fallen so heavily here, lies in the nature of the trade.",
"The husband, as I have said, was lying ill.",
"None of them would have forgotten about all of that!",
"They were not as he remembered them at all.",
"Right now, I have the television set to attend to.",
"His own brothers had abandoned him.",
"That was the second point gained.",
"This set all in motion again.",
"From the first the hospital patients with their varied needs were a great interest to her.",
"I was so ill, that my mother thought it necessary to sleep in the same room with me.",
"Before I went home, she explained to me very seriously the error into which I had fallen.",
"The day was fine, and the roads as good as they ever are in those parts.",
"I should like to have him out here on the plain.",
"It was the look of one who, having fallen from a great height, is not quite sure whether it means death or not.",
"He turned and somewhat naturally looked at his wife.",
"Her philosophy was simple.",
"The effect of the forest was still upon her.",
"There was no visible progress.",
"He would not defend himself.",
"His end was gained.",
"Through this part of the forest no road was cut.",
"They have remembered me.",
"But it has roots in something very real.",
"The whole thing seemed to be so easy and so friendly.",
"He found that being the son of his father gained him no safe conduct through the shop or with the customers.",
"He may have mentioned his official title, when he first appeared, but nobody remembered it.",

"Not a soul was anywhere visible.",
"Had it fallen in the house?",
"The other matter affected him very differently.",
"Strain, and bottle off for use.",
"Stored away in a cool dry place, it will keep good for years.",
"When cold, bottle for use.",
"Let them cool, and store them away in dry boxes, with paper between each layer.",
"Loss of natural motion and power.",
"I gained nothing by that move.",
"This is the philosophy of it.",
"There is no way to the human ear and heart but through language of some kind or another.",
"The sun had gone down behind the mountain, so they had remembered that it was time to go home.",
"He could hardly wait to make his sister the announcement to which he had already referred several times.",
"I heard that he was ill.",
"She was so kind and friendly with us right away.",
"I mean it differently.",
"It is called an island, as it is entirely surrounded by water.",
"The reason, however, is plain.",
"After months of suffering both recovered.",
"The mayor said.",
"They cut to the very roots of human life.",
"The position held by these troops was vital to the entire advance, and it required rapid action on the first day to reach the objective at the same time as the other units.",
"There were miles of roads like this.",
"Our motor was put out of commission.",
"His head was fallen forward.",
"No destruction of any kind to be committed.",
"His operations since that time are well remembered.",
"So passed the seasons then, so they pass now, and so they will pass in time to come, while we come and go like leaves of the tree that fall and are soon forgotten.",
"Only the learned doctor was happy, for he had his fee.",
"For another spell of time I remembered no more.",
"She was looking quite recovered from her illness of the evening before.",
"Naturally the time went heavily with me.",
"I had, I felt, gained an advantage in the last few seconds, for I knew my danger and understood the situation.",
"There at least would be some sort of safety, and I might possibly long before come on some of the cross roads which I knew.",
"This new regulation appears to have been founded on the ancient mode of division.",
"There is no such compensation.",
"He has to trust to himself, to form his own conclusions, and to choose his own line of action.",
"It is visible to other eyes than ours.",
"For this plain reason, man is not a fly.",
"What makes all physical or moral ill?",
"Nature, attend!",
"Friendly to peace, but not to me!",
"Reader, attend!",
"Nothing, however, was gained by this step.",
"He made no attempt to defend himself.",
"She will at least be interesting, on account of her personality.",
"Every day she had written to him long letters, full of vital interest to him.",
"I paid little attention to words whose dangerous significance would at another moment have been plain to me.",
"But we no longer knew ourselves, we had forgotten our real nature.",
"But the union is run differently this summer.",
"She had forgotten all about him.",
"He owned a car that he was willing to hire out on good security.",
"My car is out of commission.",
"How friendly they were!",
"Home even for birds was a thing of first and vital importance.",
"He had gained weight!",
"They seemed to have forgotten his presence.",
"What an awful crack!",
"I do not imagine the motion will affect me.",
"But somehow it was taken differently here within sound of the guns.",
"He began to consider that differently now.",
"And, thinking of home, I remembered my girl.",
"The girl was growing tall.",
"Some hidden purpose through the ages!",
"Why, it gets even my nerve!",
"Every day now he showed signs of stronger personality.",
"It would mean peace for the generations to come.",
"When the lights were brought in I looked at her.",
"I began to listen with a determination to remember it in order, but it was without method, or order, or system.",
"I am a very tall woman here.",
"If there is a girl, I attend to her.",
"How could I bring warning to those sleeping victims?",
"At least I had arrived at certain conclusions.",
"The only question is, has he the nerve to act.",
"Never before had I realized her beauty, her personality, as I did then.",
"Once he attempted to speak, but his voice failed him.",
"The man by now seemed to have recovered in part.",
"His own thoughts were already ranging in the same quarter, and he could supply all the missing words.",
"She would never have remembered him.",
"But he, who had not seen others like her, remembered.",
"She was going to be ill.",
"At last it was pitch dark and the rain was beginning again.",
"Though they should come close, very close, still that which he had found might remain hidden from them.",
"But his plan was set in cold determination, and he cut her short again.",
"But at last his eyes grew hard again with determination.",
"She lay by the fire, her head upon her arm, sleeping.",
"For she should be sleeping close by the fire.",
"Their presence near the spring in great numbers would indicate the presence of the things they feed upon.",
"For the bottle was broken into several pieces, and standing up on the board on which it had been set, was a solid, clear piece of ice, just the shape of the glass bottle itself.",
"As he came near the ice began to crack again.",
"On him the ban had fallen!",
"Just a friendly call then, was it?",
"The news of the proposed meeting in the school brought out many and varied comments, when it was received in the homes of the district.",
"The doctor had forgotten all about the committee who were going to wait on him that evening to receive his decision regarding the coming election.",
"Other people seemed to think the same, for no teams could be seen on any of the roads leading to the village.",
"The bank could collect the notes.",
"It reminds us.",
"He had not forgotten her!",
"His face was hidden in his hands.",
"But quickly the whole sad reality of his situation came over him, and he felt that he must nerve himself for the coming trial.",
"Nor did the evil consequences of their ill conduct rest with themselves.",
"That route was therefore abandoned.",
"My strength is failing.",
"Nobody knew outside the family that the little girl was ill.",
"He is very ill.",
"We keep our own roads in order.",
"As he lives alone, he might lie there ill, and no one would know anything about it.",
"I feed them as much as is good for them, and not any more.",
"The horse had fallen down.",
"They all seemed very friendly.",
"The result is plain.",
"It is so plain.",
"There was nothing visible.",
"Fields became roads, roads streets.",
"They were off at a right angle.",
"Naturally the visit was short.",
"Then, perhaps, they might come to a layer of dead leaves.",
"It is the being asked to believe in such an enormous change in climate, and in the height of the land above the sea.",
"That was a sight not easily to be forgotten.",
"The chemical composition is the same.",
"History may be examined from an entirely new angle.",
"Inches in height may be added every month.",
"There still remains the work to be done on the actual control of sex by man, apart from its natural determination.",
"Through them we may affect the very quality of the nerve tissue.",
"The first characteristic that struck everyone about him was the matter of his height.",
"He was tall and thin and his frame was naturally strong and large.",
"Then something else became visible.",
"All his tissues, skin, muscle, nerve, even bone, are restored.",
"But think how much pleasure the picture will give future generations.",
"I had a crack on the head from a rock right then.",
"We should never speak ill of any man without apparent just cause.",
"We must never speak ill of any man out of bad principles, or for bad ends.",
"Is it not, as most men do, out of ill design?",
"None the less it has to be attempted.",
"There has been a growing demand for personality and initiative in elected persons.",
"It is never too late for a vital issue.",
"As dark as pitch.",
"This then is probably the date of the composition.",
"And witness there destruction to our host?",
"The army was now in motion.",
"I could see all the lights in the town, too, but what did I care?",
"Then I remembered how he said he would tell me all about it some day.",
"Or perhaps it may have fallen into the water and gone down.",
"It was almost dark, but I could see them plain.",
"The electric lights had gone out!",
"And I said to leave an answer in the same bottle.",
"She had no idea of where she was, nor of how far she had fallen.",
"I have recovered my health, I have formed my resolution.",
"He is a tall, big looking fellow to be sure.",
"The ball was in motion.",
"Get in motion!",
"His smile was friendly, though the look in his eyes was cool.",
"She remembered she had been happy once, but that was ages ago.",
"They had almost forgotten there had ever been a war.",
"Her eyes were quite serious now, and indeed friendly.",
"The players, however, advanced in a more friendly fashion.",
"Indeed, he had almost forgotten her.",
"Friendly call, and all that.",
"Guns are in the first bedroom.",
"She refused him a few days before she was taken ill.",
"Another might have drawn other lessons from the same words, but these were what I needed then.",
"I think I would have remained dead to her if she had forgotten me like that.",
"Had he forgotten it?",
"She remembered now that a look, as if she were in pain, had shot itself across her eyes.",
"The letter was as plain as her talk had been.",
"I have other matters to attend to.",
"But he quickly recovered.",
"He felt pretty dirty from the job, but he was not going to tell the girls.",
"The rooms were in an angle of the building, away from all others.",
"But in the first lesson how differently he seems to speak.",
"No doubt man would have done it differently.",
"We may, however, read them for ourselves, not only in the daily lessons, but as often as we choose.",
"Never had trees seemed such beautiful and friendly things to him.",
"He made the same motion, but to an ordinary eye it was still as fast as light.",
"He was able to raise that end only a few inches.",
"Had he known and remembered that fall and the hand that forced him to it?",
"Not in any detail, naturally.",
"Here was a new angle to consider.",
"I should have forgotten that.",
"And all at once he remembered.",
"Why, she is getting quite beautiful and tall.",
"I certainly could not feed a child.",
"There were also the presents which she extracted for her husband and her little girl at the village.",
"That is the plain truth.",
"But the child whom they had to feed and save had on his side saved them also.",
"She had not pushed him, he himself had fallen.",
"Had she not been there he would have fallen just the same.",
"In that atmosphere, what hope was there of successful negotiations?",
"And the negotiations fall through.",
"Master, it is such a hard name, I have forgotten it again.",
"Ill luck!",
"They run but ill that run themselves to death.",
"Only I long to know the worst of ill.",
"This resolution, though the reasons for it had seemed to him so very plain before, he now found more difficult to carry out than to decide on.",
"The officer closed the door and came straight to the point by asking me where our store of arms was hidden.",
"I put my ear down, and caught the voice of one of the men from our village.",
"And he walked away towards the village, with the air of a man who had forgotten more than the rest of his race were ever likely to find out.",
"Lunch was the one thing they had both forgotten.",
"This reveals a striking fact that few people stop to consider.",
"We advanced rapidly on the smooth, white snow plain.",
"We had not only carried a large amount of provisions toward the south, but we had also gained valuable experience.",
"He was a tall man with a clean cut face and a hard mouth.",
"Here he had fallen.",
"Politics were excluded.",
"This is natural and friendly.",
"It did not extend far, but as far as it went, it was good.",
"This is the plain text.",
"It was in the middle of summer, but the service we were recommended to attend did not begin till it was dark.",
"The difference of climate must, I imagine, make a difference in the effect of this drug, or the practice of the old and new world could hardly differ so widely as it does in the use of it.",
"He lost nothing but gained a lot.",
"Each round was an experience of new people, new homes, new gardens.",
"Workers are a mine of information and all of it is knowledge gained from practical experience.",
"He said I should come and collect it after a week or so.",
"The students who are selected are trained and then posted to a forest.",
"I answered an examination and got a job as a forest officer.",
"On the hill we found a lot of houses, several of them illegal, coming up in the forest.",
"To hire troops is very easy to those who are willing to pay their price.",
"These arguments are admitted by some, and by others rejected.",
"This attention to his personal safety has not yet been forgotten.",
"Is there any apparent advantage to be gained by assuming a false character?",
"This motion was agreed to.",
"Such a known truth as never was denied, though it appears sometimes to have been forgotten.",
"The bill being read a second time, and a motion made for its being referred to a committee.",
"And the minister loves money, and the minister must not be forgotten.",
"It is a strong place, and surrounded with walls.",
"Rain is bad for the dates, but the roots of the tree cannot have too much water.",
"I will, therefore, content myself with a shorter.",
"He is very ill, indeed.",
"He told me he was going to try what sleeping out of town might do for him.",
"They remembered it against him.",
"I am older now, and things once hidden are revealed.",
"This was plain reading.",
"It seems awful plain up the front of it.",
"I dream it all over again as plain as if it was real.",
"She tried, as women will, to answer him with arguments, and failed, as women will fail.",
"He made no determination for or against it.",
"Perhaps he had fallen on the bed?",
"But this I know, that he is on the path to great and true conclusions.",
"He must be able to defend them against the whole world.",
"But they actually attempted force.",
"What does it matter that we take different roads, so long as we reach the same goal?",
"The second stage must be entirely successful, if the response is at all on an adequate scale.",
"Shall we in the face of this danger be weak or rise to our full height.",
"This response of the people to my appeal is not due to my personality.",
"But I suggest that when we are ready to call out the military and the police on an extensive scale we would find ourselves in a position to defend ourselves.",
"I would be failing in my duty if I do not do so.",
"Naturally we had become great friends.",
"I spent several days with them, and although they were so happy to see each other, they made it very plain that they were also happy to have me with them, he because he liked me, she because he liked me.",
"Naturally, she showed me a most friendly confidence.",
"I thought it would be well to sell them through his agency, even though I paid him a high commission.",
"With my widely extended opportunities, I naturally came to know a good deal of medicine and surgery.",
"It was plain enough that he did not like this, and he moved forward so that he might still get a view of her.",
"The first sitting was very large, many coming in who do not usually attend.",
"The access to the spot was through a forest, and by a very bad road.",
"The meeting which they went to attend was held in a private house.",
"The streets are narrow, with a run of dirty water down the middle.",
"She was the only sweet picture in that wild dream, and he would not have forgotten her for the world.",
"He knew perfectly well where he was, he remembered exactly everything that had happened.",
"He remembered the words of the girl who during these latter years had represented to him what there might have been of light in life.",
"I spoke plain words, and that was an end of it.",
"There was nothing left of that hidden fear in his dark eyes.",
"The play which he had written, every line of which appeared to gain in vital and literary force towards its conclusion, was only the first of his children.",
"Turn on the lights.",
"He turned slowly towards the door of his bedroom.",
"Plain speaking just then was impossible.",
"He sat looking out over the still sleeping city.",
"With great difficulty I extracted the truth.",
"Between them the following composition was produced.",
"Then I remembered what I had read in the local papers.",
"I am told that soon he will be offered a commission.",
"Naturally he puts on a little side.",
"Not too tall.",
"The nerve!",
"And being fallen how can he hope to live?",
"And being fallen, why should he fear to die?",
"Father of lights!",
"Nature attend!",
"The meaning is, however, plain enough.",
"He uses the symbol often.",
"She was only of medium height.",
"He was tall!",
"He was tall and large.",
"I will attend and receive it.",
"This theory now became the basis of my philosophy of life.",
"But we are restored to each other at last, I am happy to say!",
"I see it all now, it is all plain to me.",
"The ball was at its height.",
"Then, as if he remembered, he looked down at her and caught her to him with a sudden violence that almost hurt her.",
"The other sources from which this collection has been made up are so varied as to require no mention aside from that given with each title.",
"Deep in the forest there was a cross road, and she did not know which way to take.",
"Were they to be forgotten there?",
"I watched the sleeping baby.",
"Defend it.",
"He was a man of middle height.",
"I did not make use of it, but I have not forgotten it.",
"Where could this letter be hidden?",
"It was still pitch dark.",
"Moreover, the conflict reveals itself.",
"Moreover this incident shows to what a pitch our hopes had been raised.",
"It was on the point of being surrounded.",
"In several places, it may be remembered, it was low.",
"But they were surrounded.",
"He had considerable difficulty to prevent them from sleeping in his room.",
"See was the first to attend to them.",
"He always seemed able to collect items of knowledge which further research proved to be correct.",
"Too much care cannot be taken to keep the bottle perfectly sweet.",
"Nothing, however, is more simple than the mode of its preparation.",
"Not so, if ill.",
"Is the change being attempted too early?",
"Strong light must be excluded.",
"They considered them, too, as property lost, but which was to be recovered.",
"It was now dark, for night had fallen upon the awful scene.",
"When the house was reached he had almost forgotten him.",
"Then he went away into the forest.",
"But we must not ignore our responsibilities.",
"And the importance of this principle consists in this.",
"The same conditions affect men differently.",
"A man is naturally interested in the news from his own city.",
"Why there was no entrance visible was easily explained.",
"Her dress was plain.",
"The deep snow has driven them into the lower forest, where men have been at work.",
"He is in the forest.",
"It is clearly visible now.",
"It was she who first recovered.",
"He had forgotten all about the fact that he had a new one.",
"My first fee was small, but it was the biggest fee I ever had.",
"Experience may be a dear school, but its lessons are never forgotten.",
"The reason was plain.",
"I remembered.",
"There was one witness who ought not to be forgotten.",
"The only mode of dealing with her was adopted.",
"For one thing, I was taken ill.",
"Immediately, the character of that front bedroom was changed.",
"Another bedroom assumed a new meaning to us both.",
"What is the vital issue at stake?",
"From that height he could look well over the country.",
"A second on one ear brought him to the floor.",
"Only, we fear that if we are not given an opportunity to present our claims this time, we may be forgotten the next.",
"I attend various functions of the court.",
"These were the lessons.",
"It was not a surprise to read again and again, in longer or in shorter form, such an answer, based upon such a reason.",
"Her father and I thought of that, naturally.",
"When the moment arrived for taking up the collection, no one went forward to attend to that duty.",
"I had other things to attend to.",
"I have taken no measures to defend my office, my house or myself.",
"My own composition!",
"He told her in plain words.",
"Every nerve in his body seemed to respond.",
"For the moment he had forgotten.",
"I have not forgotten.",
"Plain talk!",
"That, naturally, could not be.",
"With a bottle, perhaps.",
"Was she sleeping?",
"Even her manner of walking expressed personality.",
"Not till hours later did he get as far as a plain question.",
"The men took with them part of the tea and enough fish to feed the dogs once.",
"His first thought was that she must be hidden here, but when he had beat through it half a dozen times, he knew this was impossible.",
"A forest came down to the edge of the lake.",
"He did not sleep much, and when day came it was plain he could not travel.",
"He made a motion to rise.",
"He had to provide enough to feed the dogs as well as themselves.",
"The lights may come on and we be seen from outside.",
"It all came through the lights not working.",
"But this time I had forgotten.",
"Indeed, I remembered thinking, and saying, that the story only made the place more interesting.",
"I checked myself just in time to draw back without being seen by a woman and a tall man moving slowly down the path.",
"By a wrong mental attitude we have set in motion a train of events that ends in disaster.",
"Love is supposed to be beautiful and friendly and stuff like that!",
"Anyone who lives in the forest knows that!",
"Maybe it was against the rules to send transportation money to somebody not yet under contract?",
"He remembered me.",
"Everybody was so nice and friendly.",
"He decided to wait until another time to ask to be restored.",
"The link, so long hidden, has now been made visible to us.",
"There is upon the subject of love, no doubt, much beautiful composition.",
"The ability displayed in it is a sufficient compensation.",
"The one is a view from nature, the other is a composition both from nature and from history.",
"Truth to tell, I had almost forgotten him.",
"He emerged.",
"She went into the bedroom, leaving the door not quite closed behind her.",
"There came more noise from the bedroom.",
"Is not that an evidence of its personality?",
"To him, naturally, man is the most important subject.",
"She gained her chair.",
"This was the common mode of building in the south in those days.",
"I was no longer a child, but old enough to be treated differently.",
"The destruction was enormous.",
"This first evening we spent together can never be forgotten.",
"His ability consists in his knowledge of law, rather than of men and affairs.",
"And that reminds me.",
"What I suffered at this time I have never forgotten.",
"Of course he knew, so he must have forgotten her.",
"What more can a wife and a mother ask, when she is surrounded by those she most loves?",
"The meeting appeared to be friendly.",
"What, then, do they think is gained?",
"And this does not ill describe our own case.",
"She now remembered everything and she grew very red.",
"At any rate, nothing very good, in that they all agreed, else she would have been friendly with them and would not have kept herself so apart.",
"In the middle of the circle stood the excluded child.",

["Then to the tower to watch.",
"The rest of the day, I spent between the tower and my study.",
"Breakfast over, I went up to the tower.",
"All was as it should be, and I went up to the tower, to have a look at the gardens.",
"Soon, I concluded, we should be standing right beneath it, did the path but carry far enough.",
"Beyond these, there was nothing to tell of the things that were hidden beneath.",
"I looked down, and noted that the sun was passing directly beneath me.",
"It must be the wound I see.",
"We do not realize how great a bond this is.",
"Education is the teaching of how to direct energy for the universal good.",
"It is the one good thing lacking in my life.",
"I never saw him with other covering.",
"Could it be to guard against possible failure?",
"I felt that the ground had dropped away beneath my feet.",
"He threw the cover back.",
"Suddenly he checked, cast back, and threw the book wide open.",
"He was spending an evening with a neighbor, and was asked to sing.",
"They had been here for a week, hunting and fishing.",
"He was particularly in favor of this measure, because he wanted an uniform education for every body.",
"And they like their meet raw.",
"One thing, however, is worth noting.",
"There was no furniture against this part of the wall.",
"She had great talent for music.",
"Ever heard him sing?",
"He ask me to come round and sing him a song.",
"But she threw it off.",
"They were all dressed up.",
"Her mother had always encouraged her in her work.",
"Whenever she could, she made trips to that village.",
"These trips were very hard on her and she did not rest well.",
"It shows the marks of the bottle.",
"But these golden days are past.",
"I hoped for it on the hill.",
"But before long they began to suffer from want of food.",
"On these men he could always rely.",
"His wife was in all his trials a very tower of strength to him.",
"Watch my finger.",
"A uniform pushing through.",
"She reached out the other hand, covering his with her both.",
"Never throwing anything up to me!",
"She threw out an arm.",
"All the boys threw down their books, and started to their feet.",
"It is true that improvements can be made.",
"But it was more than double that time when he came down dressed for the dance.",
"He led the way across the hall and up the first story of the tower.",
"She stopped to listen to the music at a point which she has indicated, almost directly opposite the tower.",
"Thus I think it was that I acquired my love for hunting.",
"The party outside heard him, as it was intended they should, and they supposed that my mother really had quite a force at her command.",
"I have a personal knowledge of at least half a dozen men whom he had at various times killed, one of these being at the time a member of my command.",
"It was an easy victory, and after that I could get up no more races.",
"That was the kind of spirit that pleased me, and we immediately moved forward on the enemy, getting as close to them as possible without being seen.",
"He then asked me to guide the command and I did so.",
"Children, we disagree.",
"She threw her arms around his neck and laid her face against his breast.",
"And she must keep pace with it, against her will.",
"I hate paper fronts!",
"The popular taste in fiction is universal.",
"What was it he had wound round one hand?",
"Let him suffer!",
"Or must I suffer more to make it sure?",
"And can he not command her?",
"No modern improvements, for instance.",
"Our children have suggested that a bit of raw meat fell into the fire by accident, and we have also worked it out in this way.",
"There is no other way to learn life, and build up an ideal from the raw material he has gained in other ways.",
"There never was an occasion on which military rule was more essential in military matters.",
"If my hand were to guard my head it must find some other way of it.",
"But that day it seemed we were to go hunting.",
"She looked very scared.",
"We got what we wanted earlier than we had hoped.",
"There on a rock on the other side stood my enemy.",
"The furniture was all in its usual order.",
"She is not dressed like any of the people here.",
"He gave away a great deal of her old furniture, and sold the rest.",
"There is nothing which could make a child afraid, save to see them suffer.",
"He made a step forward, calling out the last words in a voice of command.",
"He stopped, looking at me with a scared look, as if perhaps it might be true.",
"Then my heart would rest and sing.",
"Men subsequently set up marks to distinguish where both these events took place.",
"Command him to approach.",
"She often comes to tennis and tea.",
"Did that belong to the old man up there?",
"It was a distinction to bear his name.",
"The guns have the range, and the enemy knows the ground.",
"Is it the enemy, or is it friends?",
"He is again disappointed.",
"Was she giving information to the enemy?",
"They are picking up lead.",
"He raises his head.",
"The hall was wide, and filled with people all in uniform.",
"Will not steel cut?",
"Yet was I proud also, for I would suffer not his love until he had made me wife.",
"And golden hair!",
"Who has not heard snow drop from the branch upon other snow beneath?",
"Beyond this he could distinguish nothing.",
"As though they were on one side against a common enemy, and that enemy was her father.",
"He raised one finger as he looked at them.",
"She went a pace closer to it with him.",
"Kept hunting.",
"Every piece of furniture in it was the work of a master.",
"Except for that chance meeting, I saw nothing of him, and in this I was disappointed, for there were many things about the whole affair which I did not understand.",
"But I knew that all the time, and I ought to have been on guard.",
"And she was not disappointed.",
"They had been forced into the factory when nothing but places on the night shift could be got for them.",
"Was she badly injured?",
"All the farmers came to help catch her.",
"They were dressed in old clothes that people had given them.",
"Before morning came, they had built a kind of tower.",
"They saw a great tower with men on it.",
"They got their food mostly by hunting.",
"He threw it down.",
"They threw type at him.",
"None of these words needs explaining.",
"Any man can distinguish right from wrong.",
"The precise meaning?",
"At moments of strain one does not argue and logic has no appeal.",
"When he came back I thought him angry and disappointed.",
"To command a solid block of votes would certainly help.",
"At the factory white men got sick and died.",
"In fact, it looked as if he had been willing to do so, until he arrived at the factory.",
"This is the only success in that kind that can be hoped for in our day.",
"This dress, then, had been in the tower, beyond all question.",
"The heading of each story was picked out in black and gold.",
"Everything tends that way.",
"Let us fall facing the enemy.",
"So we turned about, hunting back to the camp through the still water.",
"Equally true is it that as a nation we have shown no gift for dealing with less developed races.",
"But the development has its opponents, and that is nothing new, either.",
"Factory legislation took root in their needs.",
"That was why he had left orders to be called immediately should an enemy appear.",
"The chances are there will be more of them.",
"After that no enemy air plane passed them.",
"But no such word will reach the enemy.",
"They threw themselves down in the sand.",
"We are holding our ground until we sight the enemy.",
"But the next shot came from the enemy.",
"As we are in command of the engine room, the rest should be easy.",
"And within a minute more of the enemy appeared.",
"Let one man stay behind on guard.",
"There was no use taking chances.",
"The newspaper accounts of the case threw some light on the private and domestic affairs of the victim.",
"He reached it in a step and threw open the window.",
"And the furniture at the flat is mine.",
"There were dozens of ways in which paper of this particular quality might have got to the flat.",
"No threats were used and no shot was fired during the interview.",
"With a spring I reached the window by which I hoped to escape, and quickly raised it.",
"That I should suffer arrest for her crime could not have entered her mind.",
"But they all had good faces, and none could doubt their interest, or that they were fully alive to the significance of the occasion.",
"Was she one of the things on the wall, and his enemy?",
"The shock sent him half a dozen feet from his enemy.",
"The point with its white finger of sand, was behind them now.",
"There was hunting now.",
"He threw himself back, but it was a moment too late.",
"I did not look to see it fall, this tree I hoped forever to protect.",
"He threw it down upon the ground.",
"On this occasion we had not long to wait.",
"It was to be hoped the poor fellow had gone to his final account without pain, as would have been the case had the huge shot struck him.",
"Would she laugh at him, or be disappointed?",
"Did they belong to them or to the new couple to come?",
"But I need not say more about the garden now, for I shall have occasion to refer to it again and again, and I must not tell all I know at once, else how should I make a story of it?",
"But at that precise moment she was too busy with something that must be done for his father to lay it down and begin teaching him his letters.",
"Nor was he disappointed.",
"He threw up his hands and fell like a log, the child under him.",
"But, seriously, I believe even the general will see the need of taking some radical action.",
"At the end of an hour the entire force was safe across, and as yet no sign of the enemy.",
"They are those of a man who is determined to press his country into war at all costs, and who will use any kind of logic as long as it will lead in his direction.",
"That would at least be an approach to a valuable and reasonable institution.",
"If we do I trust that we shall be disappointed.",
"Probably the enemy knew all about this vast base.",
"Before developing this attack it was essential to drive the enemy off the observation post looking down upon the main road along which the guns and troops had to pass.",
"The guard closed in behind.",
"There was never a fear that the enemy would break through.",
"Nor is that the only contribution to the fighting line which the factory makes.",
"For the women heads of households have it largely in their hands.",
"Both were disappointed.",
"Certainly they had not allowed the grass to grow beneath their feet.",
"But a heavy heart beat beneath his uniform.",
"He had been playing tennis, and had come in to rest and cool.",
"Then we should meet in a few weeks I hoped.",
"He is my enemy.",
"His wound is dangerous.",
"Further north the yellow races were less successful.",
"But in so doing he had to rely upon his own proper forces.",
"Present a solid front to the enemy.",
"Nor has this threat been remote.",
"For the time being we had quite lost the command of the air in this sector.",
"The enemy were making another attack.",
"Enemy bombing planes came over frequently.",
"What chances they missed that day!",
"The enemy was doing a good deal of night bombing at this period.",
"He said to me then that he hoped it might come true, but that he was less certain of the future than I.",
"The enemy had done much work here.",
"They warned me to go no further along the road which, they said, was under enemy machine gun fire.",
"I had hoped he would ask me.",
"Why should I have hoped she did not?",
"There he was, half a pace away, and yet he did not know me.",
"He would be disappointed, I feel sure, and so would I.",
"She threw their lies in my face.",
"The girl and her father were busy behind the counter when he entered.",
"He threw the card on the table.",
"But this was a special occasion.",
"This explanation threw light on a dark place.",
"I know, because it stuck into a finger more than once.",
"He came up with their advanced guard and fired upon them, killing their leader.",
"We shall meet again at the camp, and will keep our weapons for the enemy.",
"It was thought the enemy would not stand or defend himself at all.",
"There were also some whose recovery was attended with a total loss of memory, so that they no more knew themselves or recognized their friends.",
"The event, however, disappointed their expectations.",
"This plan was approved, and they threw the companies into columns.",
"But here, too, they were disappointed.",
"But if we watch more closely still, we should find that the plants could not live without the animals, nor the animals without the plants, nor either of them without the soil beneath our feet, and the air and rain above our heads.",
"How shall I make myself safe against the chances and changes of life?",
"Stories which point to this conclusion are not limited to any one country, but are shared by races widely remote from one another.",
"There are several versions of this tradition.",
"The new times belong to them.",
"The furniture and so forth of the house was then very poor.",
"Here was wealth, indeed, greater than he had ever hoped for.",
"The lawyer seemed disappointed.",
"Then, suddenly noting the time.",
"After that evening the man attached himself to the party on every possible occasion.",
"He told me some interesting things, which I will return to on another occasion.",
"I do not mean these, but the households of our common working people.",
"It was hard to distinguish her features.",
"Something upon which he could not place a finger.",
"We have been talking, and we agree that we belong together.",
"They wanted something more substantial and conservative as the basis of their investments.",
"This is the most precise and is generally considered to be the most correct account of the gold discovery.",
"This closed the performances of the day.",
"The causes of her rapid rise to distinction are not far to seek.",
"Especially was she impressed by her visits to some of the great works of art.",
"She said, the little birds would not sing any more, if their eggs were taken away from them.",
"Sing a song of seasons!",
"The little birds, how sweet they sing!",
"Then he threw the paper aside.",
"But some one must suffer.",
"She had dressed herself rather carefully for this interview.",
"We can only feel to a certain extent, only suffer up to a certain point.",
"The means he employed were threats.",
"Is the wound not covered?",
"This group went off by itself into a remote part of the church.",
"It has had to take big chances.",
"If they had not done so, they would not have been interesting to the men who first heard them, and, had they not been interesting, they would not have survived.",
"We examined, first, the furniture of each apartment.",
"Command me in every way!",
"The red are very rare, and their use is restricted.",
"But to distinguish these properly requires very great attention and considerable experience.",
"They are very free from oil, and disagree with few persons.",
"Great care should be observed in not using a joint too quickly after it has been injured.",
"The loss fell much the most heavily on the enemy.",
"His religion, however, is very far remote from what is called religion in this day.",
"As soon as I was dressed, I ran down into the garden to visit it.",
"But the question is, why these causes began to operate just at these times.",
"I threw the book at her head and she carried it out of the room.",
"This edition has always seemed to me the very one for which the general reader has occasion.",
"He rarely, and never, save when the occasion required it, spoke of what he had done for others.",
"Things are not attended to at all, I fear, and indeed I know it.",
"He is the only person in the whole world to whom we could belong.",
"I remember very well the occasion of our first meeting.",
"And this is the universal judgment of those in a position to know.",
"It was a golden opportunity.",
"I have not killed or injured a white man or any white person.",
"Grant was placed second in command, which meant that he had no command at all.",
"They were, however, fighting against a wall of steel.",
"There had been a special election on a bond issue and on the way his brother stopped at the various towns to got the election returns.",
"Few civilians have any idea of the intense, close watch that was kept upon the enemy throughout the struggle.",
"Another wound!",
"How strong were the enemy!",
"Now such a wound is easily opened and dressed.",
"They show themselves everywhere and they ride until they are fired upon, keeping this up until they have located the enemy.",
"It seems impossible to suffer more.",
"The wound was said not to be dangerous.",
"The enemy gave every hit as good as he got there.",
"It is cold steel alone.",
"The enemy offered little resistance.",
"Only the high command knew fine progress of the battle.",
"Then he made the motion of throwing something.",
"Well, we got beneath my house.",
"The guard is ready.",
"They sing always, or nearly so, the same theme.",
"His party survived him.",
"Moral causes are constant, and operate all the time.",
"Thought of this kind is the enemy of the human race.",
"He cannot be identified with any institution.",
"Raw, row.",
"From every point of view he is proved to have long been an enemy of ours, and the case stands as follows.",
"On what occasion?",
"In this way and for the reasons mentioned did the soldiers receive the money on that occasion.",
"He hoped to make them his subjects of their free will.",
"Picking her up in his arms, he carried her to his room and put her in his own bed.",
"Otherwise, on my death, it will be placed in the library of some national or scientific institution.",
"This checked my enemy, who for the moment seemed almost as much at a loss as myself.",
"It is not that I must not suffer pain, but that the pain must not come from without.",
"Guard both for a very short time.",
"Then a violent shock threw me from my feet.",
"No doubt they were captured by the enemy.",
"She hoped they would.",
"I belong to that.",
"Not an enemy!",
"He meant to be traveling while it was dark.",
"This was the first sign of fire in the great section that so many farmers had come to protect.",
"There was a guard around the field.",
"An awful beauty attended the scene.",
"He met farmers he knew.",
"They all threw up their hands at sight of him.",
"If there was only one guard over him, escape did not seem difficult, unless that guard had a gun.",
"The morning seemed golden.",
"And all beneath so gold, so green!",
"He never had a uniform!",
"I remember how he used to take me up to the fields all green or golden.",
"The space is too broad and too uniform to have beauty.",
"A book is a very good institution!",
"I think we are in advance only in one universal democracy of freedom.",
"Bond, which I did by the first mail that left the island after the discovery.",
"Bond to myself.",
"The distinction was too apparent.",
"I am the first officer, and in command at present.",
"Why not, when all are at command?",
"I was in no mood to take chances.",
"We were, in a measure, prepared for it, however, as the weather had been holding out threats for some time.",
"The president business is a good deal like bear hunting.",
"King threw open the door.",
"He began counting it out.",
"King went on counting.",
"Though she was little impressed by what she could see, she followed.",
"But her father it was, and she was disappointed.",
"King was hardly disappointed.",
"She began counting as she walked while they watched her wondering and following slowly after her.",
"I sit and sing to them.",
"They had races among themselves.",
"Sing it again!",
"He always looks very well himself, and I am sure he would like to see her well dressed, and the children too.",
"The furniture was pushed into a corner to leave a good floor space.",
"It had been a raw deal.",
"I must guard well its interests.",
"Why, then, had he come to the aid of an enemy?",
"Strong threw himself down to rest.",
"They tied us both to a tree, and throwing a stick in the water, told us to get it.",
"I watched them through the glass door, and saw her go to a counter and sit down.",
"I was thinking of all the stories that I knew of animals traveling.",
"What long races I should have in the green fields.",
"They were all dressed up, too.",
"He would never suffer any more.",
"She was dressed for the evening.",
"They were much impressed.",
"And she could sing.",
"The furniture was all there.",
"Successful in helping him to survive, they have survived as a functional unit.",
"The other looked up with an injured expression.",
"But there was nothing for him to do but take chances.",
"As true as steel.",
"What shall I sing?",
"At no time could the book have hoped for many readers.",
"Not a man survived.",
"I was just counting the seconds.",
"It sort of scared me when I heard the glass crash on the ground.",
"Not and have any room for the furniture.",
"It was not far from the end of the lake, and toward it they now led the girls, explaining as they went what they intended to do.",
"They disagree, I think.",
"Nobody shall suffer, if we can prevent.",
"She could never be disappointed in him.",
"He used to read to me and sing songs.",
"To love so much, to suffer so much.",
"I am disappointed in myself.",
"When summer came the garden and trips to the islands would be good for both her children.",
"I went down first, and when I saw him I was almost scared to death.",
"I am going to get her to sing a new song I am writing.",
"He began to realize that he had come to the end of his period of command.",
"The thing grew, traveling with great speed that increased with every moment.",
"As for his ability to keep pace with a horse he had no doubt that he could do it fairly well.",
"I came away feeling quite scared.",
"And if love be restricted in its mission there is but failure.",
"Yesterday she still hoped that she would be able to keep her promise.",
"If he should die it would be all over, the factory would never belong to him.",
"A country could only produce a certain supply of food, and was therefore restricted to a certain population.",
"It appears almost certain that at some point in the crisis the control of the situation was taken out of the hands of the civilians by the military.",
"I then, as king and father, will command.",
"Shall I be friends with such an enemy?",
"Command me any service in my power.",
"There is no explaining that away by any natural philosophy.",
"Yet it marks the closing of an era.",
"In view of past experience, indeed, the chances were in favor of a mistake.",
"He lay half dressed upon a narrow bed.",
"The visitors to this room were barely beneath the roof.",
"I thought it was golden when she was my friend.",
"Her hair was, in fact, golden again.",
"How far they belong to the heart and not to the head, is a detail only known to themselves.",
"The striking of the quarter found him still waiting beneath the window.",
"At last he pulled up and, turning on his box, held up one finger.",
"And at the end, beneath my window, stood a group of men.",
"Much remains to sing.",
"He cannot compromise, or understand middle actions.",
"I do not mean that he made no distinction.",
"I expected the same feelings to come again with the same occasion.",
"I thought, now my time is surely come, I have done for myself, I am going to be told that they have no longer occasion for me.",
"I have lost all distinction of season.",
"They told us also, that they were rapidly improving in the art, and I have no doubt that this was true.",
"This, I found, was frequently the case among the farmers.",
"As this is the hour for being full dressed, of course she turns the way she can be most seen.",
"Sometimes, I also attended to customers.",
"When they suffer they will grow.",
"To improve the golden moment of opportunity, and catch the good that is within our reach, is the great art of life.",
"In some cases, those suffer most who are least intended to be hurt.",
"My father attended.",
"Upon more than one occasion I was made to notice this.",
"She knew his eyes so little as to think he displayed regard for rather than respect for my command.",
"We must bear in mind that what we have now reached is a principle, or universal potential, only we have located it in the individual.",
"I may, perhaps, have the opportunity of considering this subject on some future occasion.",
"These officers, for the most part, are men who have lived long in the country, who know the native languages, and are familiar with the lie of the land from experience gained in past hunting trips.",
"We might apply the expression to the present occasion, but it would be true in part only.",
"At the close of the evening they all formed one group at a little distance from the rest of the company, and in a situation to command a view of it.",
"Here and there he could distinguish a half sentence.",
"If a people rely for freedom on its soldiers, the soldiers will rule the country, not the people.",
"It is against my religion to regard any one as an enemy.",
"It means the beginning of success if only the supporters continue the policy for which I stand.",
"Both the military and the police were injured.",
"Those who fight may expect to be injured.",
"It is absolutely lacking.",
"I do not know any of my friends who would not guard it with his life, if he found it in danger.",
"I determined to take no chances.",
"He was greatly impressed by this, and talked a good deal about it.",
"It was largely attended by relations and friends.",
"I think it is almost the greatest lesson that we have to learn, to stand so fast in times of trouble as not to suffer loss.",
"In this way the institution has been supported without any regular funds.",
"The meeting was pretty fully attended, and the people were mostly quiet, considering there were many who could not understand.",
"Our reading meetings are pretty well attended this winter.",
"The institution appears to be now in excellent order.",
"When we asked her what was the nature of the mass, she said she did not understand it, but she attended it because others did.",
"A meeting was called, and so many attended that the room could not contain them all.",
"The mother hoped the latter.",
"They had to take their chances.",
"On this occasion no records were broken.",
"Her cheap furniture had gone.",
"What she must suffer!",
"I knew that I had talent, I was always sure of making a living, but I got no further.",
"We are only human, and did suffer so.",
"They were going to the races, to the ball, to all the shows.",
"The official stuck out a finger.",
"He set it on the counter and looked at me.",
"The old man ran the tip of his finger down the list of names.",
"He was disappointed.",
"Get up, and sing!",
"It was a long story of a woman whose magic power lay hidden behind the marks upon her face.",
"Here he was disappointed.",
"And he threw them across to her.",
"Will I come and sing?",
"She broke down and covering her face with her hands turned away.",
"This he said to find occasion to say that he was come for.",
"This man, without looking at any one, without saying anything, threw down a piece of money on the counter.",
"This is an incident which one cannot help noting.",
"But I hoped for nothing more that night, and I was right.",
"The poor women still hoped.",
"I had hoped at one moment that they would attack it while I was there.",
"I never saw the man except on this occasion.",
"Had a counter order been given?",
"They kept watch upon the enemy, but they did not turn their attention in the true direction.",
"The day having come, the hour having struck, the mechanism being completely wound up, it had only to be set going.",
"To what species do they belong?",
"They knew, or at least they thought they knew, that the enemy was a long way off.",
"The enemy was a long way off.",
"She should be allowed, and even encouraged, to take the same active exercise.",
"The state of the eyes should always be attended to.",
"Of what, then, is a parent to be afraid, or against what is she to guard?",
"To whom then are we to turn our eyes for help on this occasion?",
"He was the man for the occasion.",
"And shall I suffer one I love to die?",
"Say we command it?",
"In each case there was no other wound on the body.",
"There was no other wound on the body.",
"By day, however, the hunting was entirely different.",
"This is a radical distinction from which important consequences follow, and should, therefore, be carefully noted by the student.",
"It is a universal law that if we reverse the action of a cause we at the same time reverse the effect.",
"Then the literature of the occasion began.",
"Well, he would tell her the truth, that was all, and take the chances.",
"The manner in which women were dressed upon the stage had changed since the last time when his mother had visited the theater.",
"Now he was determined to stake his chances.",
"He hoped so.",
"The pace was telling upon her.",
"Such are the chances of trial by jury!",
"But I managed a compromise now and then.",
"I also learned that it was not by any means the first occasion when this business had taken place.",
"His manner impressed me so much that I began to doubt whether some mistake had not been made.",
"Sometimes I talked of mine, and on one occasion told the following curious incident in my long career.",
"It was fine furniture, too!",
"If only that furniture were paid for!",
"It meant that the furniture bill was as good as paid!",
"We hope to go forward together, building and changing and improving it.",
"He examined the clothes in which the baby was dressed.",
"But how can we find this golden line and live along it?",
"She restricted his hours of play.",
"He hoped he would land flat.",
"We are always looking for fresh talent.",
"Just beneath this window was a door and steps.",
"Throwing them on the ground he opened them.",
"Bad luck attended the southern trip of the show.",
"But about the discount.",
"Since his death the other children run no more races.",
"If we play golf or tennis, they also play these games.",
"Which, I could only tell by noting the time.",
"Then threw out a hand.",
"He concerned himself only with the command, not the manner in which it was given.",
"The cell was remote.",
"He had been injured.",
"What did it matter to me, if I made others suffer?",
"They were to be disappointed.",
"There was no need for a close guard.",
"Threw me down from start to finish, he did.",
"He killed a guard.",
"But he was an ill man to make an enemy of.",
"Killed a guard, they say.",
"Then the chances of the battle would be more even.",
"He had had a score of chances.",
"They went hunting.",
"He found it difficult to keep pace with the dogs.",
"They were short of food and had expected to go hunting next day.",
"Operations on all fronts.",
"The enemy had a great choice of objectives.",
"I hoped against hope.",
"It seems to me that they must suffer less.",
"I believed now that what I had hoped was true.",
"Because she is a mere child, she will be most impressed by its mass.",
"One of them was behind the counter when I walked into the place.",
"And this rule is universal.",
"I say stands, but I know not if it has survived the war.",
"For the moment that thought scared him.",
"What kind of bond?",
"Only force enough was lacking.",
"That law is universal.",
"Bring me her command in writing!",
"Some persons now have a nervous fear of that word, and of allowing any importance to difference of races.",
"About going on and taking the chances.",
"It was still longer before any one attended her.",
"Other farmers did the same.",
"All were scared, even though the soldiers were with us.",
"I had hoped to be there on the interesting occasion, but was too late.",
"She liked the boy in the same way she had liked dozens of boys.",
"He ran his finger down the pages.",
"Her plan was now made up to go forth and meet the body, and nothing short of a command from her mother could have stopped her.",
"Of that war, itself, there is little occasion to speak.",
"He is up and dressed, and at work by the job.",
"How they sing, and how they play!",
"Some of them have given me great pleasure, and encouraged me to believe I had friends whose faces I had never seen.",
"We came to a compromise on the great question, and the time was settled for the last day of summer.",
"This time the note of command was effective.",
"The furniture of the room was plain, not to say severe.",
"There was no compromise here.",
"And that meant that he must suffer, suffer as she had suffered last night.",
"He must steel himself for this.",
"He hoped she would laugh.",
"She would prefer to suffer herself.",
"He threw his arms around the old man, who seemed on the point of falling.",
"She threw them off and sat down in the library.",
"He only heard mere bits of news about all this affair.",
"It was formed only after subsequent events threw new light on the subject.",
"No distinction was made as to a state of war and a state of peace.",
"We have been unable to rely on any one.",
"While traveling they usually went almost in single file.",
"At times she would seem to be heading in our direction, and then again would turn and slowly feed away.",
"However, I could count on several shots before they ran out of sight, and even at such a distance I hoped to get one and possibly the pair.",
"He could not rely too much upon his advantage in age.",
"It had happened as we had hoped on starting out.",
"The man was looking around for something to bind up the wound with.",
"He hoped it would all come out right, though.",
"He had hoped to get a ride.",
"But he knew that it was dangerous to remain there now, and, taking the can of oil with him, he started slowly up the heading.",
"After a time he threw down the pick and passed his head through the opening, but it was not yet large enough to receive his body.",
"Then, suddenly, he came to the end of the heading.",
"He had followed the heading in instead of out.",
"The course of the heading was far from straight, and his progress was very slow.",
"He came to the heading.",
"He would work his way through it this time and keep to the heading.",
"The doctor said he would come out of it in time, and went away to see to the others who had been injured.",
"What are the chances?",
"When he came to the heading, he turned to go back to the face of the fall.",
"Why, at least, does it not keep pace, in some measure, with the progress of time?",
"However I hoped well.",
"We have no occasion to go to a distance for what we can pick up under our feet.",
"The distinction is very just.",
"It fell below my ideas of the furniture.",
"To be always on guard.",
"When it is full, it contracts.",
"It is covered at its base with a fold of the true skin, called its root, from beneath which it seems to grow.",
"It is certainly the most precise and certain in its results.",
"We often fail to distinguish between the sense of taste and that of smell.",
"If the finger be placed in cold or warm water the temperature appears to rise when a red glass is held in front of the eyes.",
"The injured parts should be kept at rest.",
"This tends to force out the air.",
"In each case ask the observed person to distinguish between them.",
"Such was the present occasion.",
"Not an enemy surely, or they would have taken the lives thus placed within their power.",
"They will be tried as secret agents of the enemy.",
"I rarely hear him sing as he used to.",
"The next occasion was of a different order.",
"The public was, as it had no right to be, disappointed.",
"Logic is logic.",
"There was, however, no answer to her command.",
"I found as before that I had to repeat the command myself.",
"The occasion.",
"Nor had I occasion to do it.",
"I know her to be my enemy.",
"All the people passed, and soon the last one was hidden behind the heavy factory door.",
"He had never looked so high above the factory before.",
"Very slowly, with little firm steps, he went by the factory door, and then around under its windows to the wood at the back.",
"The others perhaps had been too scared to come.",
"He could stroke its bright breast, and it would sing perhaps.",
"They did that dozens of times until they were tired of it.",
"He hoped she would wait for him, but if she did not he would find his way alone easily enough.",
"And he could not have told how or from where the command had come, but he knew as he looked that he must cross that sea and go into the new world beyond it and see all things for himself.",
"And then at last they were traveling so fast that it felt as though the boat were standing perfectly still in a cold dark place.",
"The children were glad to find the forest roof beneath them again.",
"He stopped and picked it up and threw it back with a laugh in the direction it had come from.",
"That was the most natural thing for his opponents to do.",
"Somehow, she felt that she could rely upon this promise.",
"There was decided emphasis to the last sentence.",
"Guard the camp, and write out the report of our battle.",
"Then, this duty performed, he set out to try and find the girl whose face had so impressed him.",
"She could not respect her parents as she had hoped.",
"There she had hoped much, and found almost nothing.",
"When they were at home again her mother threw both her arms around her.",
"The occasion was a strange one.",
"They threw in turn, each throwing higher than his fellow.",
"Now is the time and occasion to show forth the counsel and help we can afford to our king.",
"She was a great hand to sing and she taught me.",
"It threw him off his balance somewhat.",
"Why should she be disappointed?",
"He was not disappointed.",
"He hoped she believed him.",
"However, it was a very fit song for her to sing, because she was a lady herself.",
"They compromise.",
"Then, too, there was the missing finger.",
"They found a hand with one finger missing.",
"Bad logic, but a correct conclusion.",
"If there were a man missing who had lost that finger it would, of course, be an important fact.",
"Or, again, if there were any evidence that the finger had been removed before death, it would be highly important.",
"There are no marks of violence or signs of injury.",
"Because it would require more explaining than the original problem.",
"For fully half a minute no change could be seen in the uniform surface.",
"This element seems to be universal.",
"But this is certain, we are not improving much in the make of them.",
"Much of what they sing cannot be joined in by the people.",
"Their performances are of a curious description.",
"Marks in this town.",
"Choice bits.",
"Light covering.",
"Covering the head with bed clothes.",
"Means of improving the hearing.",
"Covering for the feet.",
"And whenever this happens, the health must soon suffer.",
"Many a mother has seriously injured her child by pressure.",
"My life tends that way now.",
"All contracts of sale were good without writing.",
"It is not to be expected, however, that new methods and rules of action in government shall become universal in the states and not ultimately bring about a change in the national system.",
"Who are those children dressed in red?",
"He never refers to him again.",
"How were they disappointed!",
"What my heart suffered, that it must suffer.",
"I am quite sure on occasion he really would wish to be useful.",
"At last she threw the chain around her neck.",
"Nothing is too high, nothing too low, for his occasion.",
"It contains several persons of vast talent little known to the world.",
"To this distinction in affairs and arms he added equal distinction at the bar.",
"He did not suffer, because he did not feel.",
"Men look on him as a national institution, a part of the public property.",
"The student explained the situation, adding that he hoped to have the money the following week.",
"The meeting was well attended.",
"The meeting was well attended and greatly enjoyed by all.",
"And as this institution had already been put in issue in the general elections of the country, it could not well be left out on this occasion.",
"It requires a great occasion to take the full measure of the man.",
"I have attended to his immediate wants, I believe.",
"He walked for a few moments without looking at the wound.",
"But is there no bond of union?",
"He did take up his cards, and for a few deals attended to the game.",
"Should she see him from the top of the tower?",
"The tower is on fire!",
"He raises her.",
"He stands beneath the stars.",
"To save the rooms within the tower was impossible.",
"Last night the old life died out as the smoke from that old tower.",
"She threw her arms round his neck.",
"She could distinguish nothing.",
"That I see has been attended to.",
"He was now considered as a dangerous enemy, and treated as such.",
"Imagine now the feelings of those who had to wait round the fire while the others were attended to!",
"He would put them in the way of everything, and see that they were properly attended to.",
"I alone suffer now.",
"Nobody is injured so far.",
"Who is injured yet?",
"I said I hoped he was not badly off.",
"They should not draw upon the walls of their rooms, nor cut the furniture.",
"He gave us some excellent wine, and took us over the tower near the church.",
"They hoped a fine work of art would exercise a deep and permanent effect upon the lives of those who lived near it.",
"I was myself a little disappointed.",
"The tower is much later, but is impressive.",
"There are many different versions.",
"I first met with one person who knew one part, then with another person who knew another part, but nobody could sing the whole.",
"Please be encouraged to send us error messages even years after the official publication date.",
"But he had made a beginning at resistance and was encouraged.",
"Nevertheless, there was something lacking.",
"True, I gave it to myself, but lacking another I had the right.",
"Really, this is the only room in the tower, and no one is there.",
"But the talent for description is a gift.",
"She turned and took her ring off her finger.",
"At the end of the week she would find the furniture all in its place and her room quite straight.",
"Nobody else, however, was encouraged.",
"He name belong him.",
"For her hair is given to her for a covering.",
"She threw it up in the air much higher than usual and it never came down again.",
"Also, we dressed out of it as well.",
"Watch the others going the same pace.",
"Did he command?",
"At last I made out the sea, over half a mile straight beneath.",
"He just put things in order, that was all, and it took him a long, long time to make the improvements.",
"I encouraged him.",
"Last night would not have happened had I not encouraged him.",
"But if I should see occasion, I will take leave to return to it.",
"Like her mother, she was very simply dressed.",
"The emphasis on this word is important.",
"Perhaps we may find that something less than logic and more than a dream may be of use to us.",
"The position of a child is, on the whole, one of great distinction.",
"Very little was known of his history, for he would neither speak of it himself nor suffer others.",
"People who live in glass houses should not take chances.",
"I got up, dressed, and went out.",
"And if there is a great wrong, somebody must suffer.",
"I am very well, and get about much more than I could have hoped.",
"I sing, or shall sing.",
"It is a distinction of species.",
"On going to the city, I had hoped to be able to live in the same manner.",
"These simple words impressed me.",
"On another occasion the chief himself brought the service to a sudden check.",
"He is a very bright boy, and shows considerable talent for drawing.",
"The children are very pretty and attractive, and their faces give promise of an intelligence which is lacking in those of the adults."],

"They had a light load to pull, and kept increasing their speed at every jump, and I found it difficult to hold them.",
"In a few minutes I was in the land of dreams.",
"Dreams are no more.",
"Everybody boats.",
"She makes me think of a bird.",
"She wondered sometimes where her old strength had gone.",
"When he turned again his face was not a pleasant sight to see.",
"He wondered it had never occurred to him before.",
"His left arm was gone and all the fingers from his right hand.",
"There should be no more weak delay.",
"And his friend reflected.",
"It was a comfort to sight a settlement off there on the point.",
"She had some money of her own, and she went abroad.",
"They went first to see the dogs fed.",
"More little boats going down, and still nothing going up.",
"Conclude it granted then.",
"One wondered about it from time to time.",
"He had his hat by this.",
"Is my hat on straight?",
"Then comes an inquiry into the physical properties of surrounding objects.",
"Bird had given him his breakfast to take with him.",
"Bird with the name of class and school.",
"As to how a story should be told, opinions differ.",
"It is what its title indicates, the first flight steps in electricity.",
"The boats began to break up.",
"The governor preferred to let it grow.",
"Fighting carries with it a severe penalty.",
"She used a manner of speech foreign to our parts, but very soft and pleasant in the ear.",
"It was a difficult mark, but the light was good and my hand steady.",
"I used my eyes, which are very sharp, and had no doubt of it.",
"The sound of the shots had brought the bird out to see what was going on.",
"I tested the thing in my mouth and between my fingers.",
"But I would not hear of delay.",
"At last came the time when the boys were to arrive.",
"How very few think anything at all of such a tie!",
"This was the state of affairs on a certain soft wet day when the family were all within doors.",
"As she moved along she wondered at herself more and more.",
"No one else has covered her face when she has spoken to me.",
"We should be to them as dreams.",
"By that time we had settled, and found for ourselves a pleasant home of our own.",
"Things have effects so different on the minds of different men.",
"All this I knew as well as he did, and also his views on public matters, his political opinions, which naturally were different from mine.",
"Next day I returned to the problem which I had not been able to solve.",
"There is not a bird to be seen in the air above, nor an animal on the ground below.",
"Probably he himself would not and could not have spoken definitely on the point.",
"Their minds were not running on parallel lines.",
"Tradition was ignored.",
"I went to a small hotel, took a room, and began to read all the newspapers, seeking to discover if anyone was reported missing.",
"Then he suddenly remembered he was in the presence of a lady and took off his hat.",
"The other girls he ignored.",
"It did not enter their minds even to doubt that these low forms of life were generated in the matters in which they made their appearance.",
"The battle had to be fought again.",
"He is already the victim of the feeling I have spoken about.",
"The men, it was easy to see, were much more efficient in movement than the officers in handling them.",
"But the guns were now loud and quick.",
"He knew every inch of the ground.",
"This was some comfort.",
"He needs comfort and counsel.",
"Perhaps he would discover something.",
"Take comfort.",
"This she resolved to do.",
"It was plain that he was the only resource.",
"The night wore on.",
"Come then, till death let us speak together and comfort each other.",
"Yet he fought the desire.",
"I have fought.",
"She closed her hand hard on the edge of the table to steady herself.",
"And she must step into his confidence to discover his plans.",
"She wore a dress of some very soft material.",
"Parks met us in the lower hall.",
"Parks must have been on the front steps looking for me, for he came running down them almost before the car had stopped.",
"Parks would know.",
"Parks joined me as I turned back into the house.",
"Parks followed me and closed the door.",
"Then, as I took down my hat, a sudden thought struck me.",
"Those were the only words spoken.",
"My father, who is of the old school, is most upset concerning it.",
"Sometimes I think we always get just what we deserve in this here world, and that the only safe way is to try to deserve something good.",
"Her fingers were almost on the bar.",
"The head chief wore this only at such great meetings as this one.",
"In that island he had seen the people raising rice.",
"The next year there was a great deal of rice.",
"With this club he fought his way down the lines.",
"That was very pleasant to the boy.",
"But all night long the flat boats were pushed across and then back again for more men.",
"The men were in the wet almost all the time.",
"He asked them to let him tie her to the big ship till morning.",
"They had nothing like our matches for making fire.",
"In that time the white people had not yet found out how to make matches.",
"Other men had made such boats before.",
"For many nights he could not sleep, because he had lost all his work.",
"He fought with the bear in the tree, and killed it.",
"A friend of his one day threw up his cap in the air.",
"When the cap came down, it had a hole in it.",
"It was a great, big, wooden hand.",
"But the big wooden hand never caught him.",
"Both the boys had fine minds.",
"But he said, that, if their mother and sisters were willing to be poor, he would send the other son to college.",
"So the mother and sisters were asked.",
"The boys promised to take care of their mother and sisters if the property should be lost.",
"He wondered what had brought her out on so cold a night.",
"People could walk in the wet with dry feet.",
"Sometimes they were in the boats.",
"The men were so weak, that they could hardly row the boats.",
"Then they tried to see which side could beat the other at spelling.",
"And everybody in the town wondered that the boy knew so much.",
"This is not to say that in the currency of language they are rich.",
"So it is with all our ideas and with all our words to cap them.",
"We hear some one say that he reads faces.",
"Plan, design, project, scheme, plot.",
"Analyze each of the words given below into its various uses or applications.",
"She lay with a sharp list and her other side was under water.",
"She did not wear a hat and, since the night was warm, had put nothing over her thin dinner dress.",
"The focus of their reflected color is in the atmosphere far on this side.",
"He was weak from loss of blood, but his thoughts were sharp, clear as never before.",
"To make a stone house as good as a wooden one we must build a wooden one inside of it.",
"No one was abroad.",
"None die to be forgotten who deserve to be remembered.",
"The comparison thus exhibited to the eye is an impressive one.",
"They are not all under one hat.",
"They have knowledge enough to reach a safe harbor.",
"Take the item of the care of children in city parks.",
"He scored a clean hit.",
"He picked up his cap and moved toward the door.",
"Should the man who carries them be in danger of capture, they must be destroyed.",
"A few moments later a cap again appeared in the opening.",
"It was not a cap this time.",
"But that, he reflected, was not his fault.",
"Part of her story, he reflected, must be true.",
"But the time when this discovery would have brought comfort was passed.",
"That they had not made at once for the scene of crime brought me some small sense of comfort, but not much.",
"No, I had not spoken.",
"I want him to get such comfort as he can out of my belief and my desire to serve him.",
"Nights and nights I have done this.",
"Then I could not tell whether the finger on which she wore it gave any evidence of this ring having been pulled off with violence?",
"I preferred flight.",
"But others have had to suffer, and that has made hell of my nights.",
"He had wondered what those teeth were for.",
"All through the long nights he knew that she was just beyond the door, and he was content.",
"Why was she so still, he wondered?",
"And he would have followed her, and fought for her always, and died for her when the time came.",
"More than once he had fought for his life within the circle.",
"They missed by an inch.",
"She told him many other things in the days and nights that followed.",
"The man was returning, and with him was the girl.",
"They had fought to kill it.",
"The wind was in his face and he kept a sharp watch for game.",
"It was he who had spoken.",
"I will arrive on that hill on the other side.",
"When they arrived they fought.",
"His teeth became white.",
"There was a bird on a tree nearby.",
"They arrive.",
"It was not pleasant, this making ready for a battle.",
"Pink, and pink, and pink!",
"The sisters were fighting over him.",
"Mother did not answer for the first time in nights beyond the counting.",
"But no one said a word, for not one of the sisters was able to speak.",
"Definition of dreams.",
"The noise with which they are accompanied.",
"For many years I have studied the figures in relation to private wealth and the wealth of nations, and I have written at length on the subject.",
"This scheme was agreed.",
"I could not always find it in myself to praise his friendly spirit.",
"To arrive at peace we must first of all desire peace.",
"Horrible moment of uncertainty.",
"Its life was returning to it, fresh and new.",
"I do wish I was a bird!",
"The student reflected for some minutes.",
"Time wore on.",
"I resolved to investigate the matter for myself.",
"The inquiry made many turn their eyes towards the great clock in the square.",
"I praise his name.",
"They seem to think that the only way to solve the problem is for the men to murder each other.",
"Some of them on returning must have had difficulty in identifying their homes.",
"For the men no praise could be too high.",
"Then tea and pleasant talk.",
"He reminded them that he had spent his whole time in nursing their men.",
"Was he telling the truth, I wondered?",
"What, I wondered, did it mean?",
"The pair seemed to be on familiar terms, and I wondered whether they were engaged.",
"I wondered.",
"Was she dead, I wondered?",
"We sat for a long time discussing the strange affair.",
"Was she, I wondered, about to reveal to me the truth?",
"Did she, I wondered, know the actual truth?",
"If we could only discover the body of the dead woman, then the rest would be clear, she declared.",
"He wore also a flat cap, with a peak.",
"They were all from places abroad.",
"If he is abroad, keep it until he returns.",
"What, I wondered, did he know?",
"He was trying to discover that spot, and was greatly disappointed at not being able to do so.",
"What, I wondered, was her secret?",
"What secret, I wondered?",
"What, I wondered, was her history?",
"I returned to the hotel, resolved to wait for a few hours longer.",
"Several times the police made inquiry of me, but I could tell them nothing.",
"What were they, I wondered?",
"Some of these boats are large, some small, some of medium size.",
"But it may be exhibited in various other ways.",
"Victory or defeat!",
"To the polls!",
"We were too wet and cold to sleep.",
"It had been suggested to him that he should have the body brought home, but he preferred to leave it where it fell.",
"They had spoken thus of many other harbor towns in the centuries that men have gone down to the sea.",
"They all seem to be pleasant.",
"His voice raised itself to a sharp command.",
"What is more, he has been doing so ever since he spoke of returning home.",
"A man with a past is always more pleasant than one with a future.",
"It was pleasant enough to leave our house behind.",
"He resolved to strike off along a new track.",
"And there would have been no hat!",
"The hall clock had no doubt on the point.",
"It will steady him.",
"He examined the hat as though it were a new form of bomb.",
"It was spoken of, even reduced to the written word.",
"At any rate, he resolved now to leave well enough alone.",
"She resolved to go.",
"She wondered why.",
"And if we pink him, he is done for.",
"Does any man who has a wife and sisters or children at home, say go on?",
"There was but one voice in her praise there.",
"They fought their way to it.",
"It will appear at last, as that great day of days, which will conclude, so we believe, the drama of human history, and all men shall give account for their own works.",
"Who am I, to take away comfort from any human being!",
"We all like comfort.",
"But what kind of comfort do we not merely like but need?",
"Indeed, I am the only person to blame, for I ought to have spoken on the subject long ago.",
"God deals fairly with both, and pays both what they have earned.",
"With this book he scored a success.",
"Mad he certainly was, for all his dreams.",
"On I went as it seemed to me for many nights and days.",
"Then he took his hat and went home.",
"I have some things here to attend to that may delay us that long.",
"What pleasant rooms these are.",
"He was at one time, and in the worst of times, my own familiar friend, and great comfort to me then.",
"Solve me this problem.",
"I resolved to be up and see them off.",
"They had no other resource.",
"Brothers and sisters!",
"On her head she wore a black pointed hat.",
"There were so many more questions he wanted to ask, and he wondered if he would ever again have the opportunity.",
"He and I are the only passengers!",
"He wondered at this.",
"The age of figures, the age of electricity, began.",
"Defeat was marked on their faces.",
"By the very statement of the question it was resolved upon.",
"I would always have preferred to be married and have a family like other women.",
"Night was coming on, and it was wet and cold.",
"The enemy fought for a while like men in a death struggle.",
"Spirit of praise.",
"Her husband had told her that she was no longer of use to him, and he should divorce her.",
"She felt she must be left in no uncertainty on this point.",
"She laid up a store which became in later months a great source of comfort to her.",
"How I could be any comfort to my father, struck me with wonder.",
"It must have been because I was never spoken to at all, that I forgot what was right and what was wrong, for I do not believe that I ever remembered I was doing wrong all the time I was reading in the library.",
"I was lost in dreams of what I was going to see.",
"But there is no word in any spoken language that covers so wide a field.",
"It is not a pleasant sound to hear.",
"She stood for a moment looking at the ground with a sort of wonder in her eyes, not pleasant to see.",
"It may have been that he preferred to have him talking than watching.",
"Her cap was on one side, her mouth open.",
"His hand was not quite steady.",
"They said different things when the music was loud.",
"His great hand, broad and thick, had a certain sense of quiet comfort and strength in it.",
"It is possible that he suddenly remembered the threat concerning it.",
"A loud report, and the room was full of smoke.",
"No word was spoken.",
"She wondered whether he would kill her.",
"She wondered whether she was in love with her husband.",
"She stopped and reflected.",
"The country boy minds his folks, and his teacher.",
"But everything else minds him.",
"God has greater things for us all to do than we can now understand, but all his purposes must wait on our getting free from everything that would defeat our work.",
"None the less they saw, and wondered, and thought that there was something back of it all.",
"Once these boys and girls have an education they cannot be ignored or kept down.",
"His teeth and his friends gone, why should he keep the peace and be civil?",
"He remembered his mother telling him the story and pointing out the spot, while he was yet a child.",
"At first they thought it a kind of animal, that fixed itself to and fed upon wood.",
"Electricity is of much service.",
"Most preferred the latter.",
"And her teeth!",
"I picked up my hat and walked off.",
"Now let us talk of something more pleasant.",
"What is the use of my saying what some of these opinions are?",
"The leader is probably always an old bird.",
"The delay had told.",
"Over and over again the mother looked at the clock.",
"I have not even spoken to my brother about it.",
"He sits there alone all the time.",
"But her dreams were not to come true.",
"Other means of increasing the space available for passengers are also under consideration.",
"Upon a time does not mean that any one sat down on a watch, or made himself familiar with the town clock.",
"A close watch was kept on him, and one morning he was seen to drive down to the west side of the bridge and tie his team behind a house, where he thought they would be safe until he returned.",
"It was one of my favorite hard words and was not in the spelling book.",
"Another of his jobs was to meet the boats.",
"They had fought a great fight, a fight to be proud of, a fight which will live longer than many a victory.",
"We must hold the light steady until they find themselves.",
"Right and left, and up and down and back and forth they fought.",
"More than is seen or felt by common minds.",
"Then with an effort he pulled himself together and went away, returning with a light.",
"The only interview which he had was anything but a pleasant one.",
"It was not a pleasant say, and, truth to tell, it was not said in a pleasant manner.",
"Then he did not sleep well at night, and when he did sleep he had constantly bad dreams.",
"All of the men who were not otherwise provided for accompanied the father and son.",
"If they defeat us, it will be no more than we deserve.",
"She will not do this until she is forced to it by defeat.",
"They think that there is plenty of time to do a little business for themselves on the way to defeat the enemy.",
"He knows that this is such stuff as dreams are made of.",
"Yet count our gains!",
"At any rate during his delay all sorts of stories were current, and all sorts of behavior resulted.",
"On one point their minds were very clear.",
"I was going home after a pleasant visit.",
"It is only by a husband that a girl can, as a rule, be attended abroad.",
"To me its only value lay in the friendly relation it established with one I had begun greatly to like.",
"When she found that my last word was spoken, her mood changed at once.",
"There was need to provide as carefully as possible for her comfort.",
"We, so careful of our own life and comfort, care little for those of others.",
"There is danger in delay.",
"The former deserve no compensation and the latter no penalty.",
"Furthermore, we have not been able to discover by whom, or for what reason, these people were shot.",
"Orders had been issued that only food and shirts were to be taken.",
"She pays for them.",
"Probably they, as individuals, do not know who pays them.",
"Always he had lived in her dreams.",
"These things had transformed his relation of thought toward her.",
"It changed the minds of men and women.",
"And he preferred that it should be his own.",
"Sometimes on still nights he caught sounds like that.",
"We fought fire.",
"The blood covered her fingers.",
"No names were spoken.",
"Instead he passed the hat.",
"She wondered what this interview meant.",
"But he knew this was the day he would laugh in the teeth of death.",
"She has no family connection but a brother, has never had sisters, and she seemed to take little interest in the persons whom she met.",
"All showed that they were well kept and well fed.",
"She told me that she reads all the newspaper reports of the progress of science.",
"This letter was accompanied with copies of the original papers.",
"The look he gave me was far from pleasant.",
"In any case it must have resulted in delay.",
"It seemed to me I was looking at the man for the first time, and it was not a pleasant picture.",
"Here is my scheme.",
"Each man fought for himself, in his own way.",
"As a rule success comes only to those who deserve it.",
"For the sisters, however, I could make no excuse.",
"He wondered.",
"His great mouth stood open showing his teeth.",
"He broke his match between nervous fingers.",
"She wondered why he asked.",
"Then there would be no more delay.",
"He was returning for her.",
"And without too much delay.",
"But, before leaving, he did what he could to make for her comfort during his absence.",
"Then the cold reminded her, and she worked long building another.",
"She wondered if he had forgotten her.",
"The morning wore on.",
"She had been with him all these days and nights.",
"The good also produces from itself all things, first, middle, and last.",
"I have often wondered what became of it.",
"I come home, and this is my comfort!",
"His attitude indicated that the real business of the day was over, now that he had spoken.",
"She tried to think of a future apart from marriage, apart from the hopes and dreams that had been so dear and sweet.",
"Every one who reads this wants to see her.",
"He wondered what the teacher wanted with so many figures, but decided he would humor her, and made page after page of them for her.",
"When the letter was written she sat in a pleasant dream, thinking of the new world that had opened before her.",
"He resolved to say as little as possible, when he saw her coming.",
"His eyes never left her face, though he could not discover how much she knew, and yet the very fact of her coming to him seemed to prove that she knew everything.",
"The only news they receive is by the monthly mail when it comes.",
"Besides being cold they were fed on very poor food.",
"I have not told what became of my brothers and sisters.",
"This was on account of the poor food she had been fed on.",
"We are all brothers and sisters.",
"I was very tired, and I had a very soft and pleasant bed, so I soon fell into a heavy sleep.",
"I gave it to him, and wondered what on earth he was going to do with it.",
"We were in the little wooden house by this time, and I looked around it with surprise.",
"I wondered very much what its name was.",
"They always fought to get free.",
"They say a dog is the only animal that dreams.",
"Father has taken solid comfort though, in breaking her of them.",
"Wood, for her face had lost the happy look it usually wore.",
"He took his hands from his face, and there was a dog that had separated himself from all the other animals, and was trying to comfort him.",
"I wondered whether I could do anything for the poor animals.",
"When I was a few months old, I began to find the stable yard narrow, and wondered what there was outside of it.",
"When I was about a year old, I began to stay out days as well as nights.",
"It was no longer pleasant to sit up.",
"In the morning the garden was wet.",
"Her eyes were wet.",
"The old man came home quite steady.",
"He was resolved.",
"It appeals more than any to mere common sense.",
"We know not what we shall discover.",
"The history of sex goes back far in the scheme of life.",
"And it may show us a source for a good deal of the material of dreams and dream states.",
"And no doubt there is a relation.",
"But this new scheme is great!",
"It can arrive in no other way.",
"We have not fought for a king.",
"It will cause delay.",
"After breakfast he took his hat and started out.",
"He lived in an excess of luxury and show.",
"Pretty soon it began getting dark and I could see the lights coming out on all the different boats just like stars.",
"I can prove it, because I got my feet wet.",
"Several other boats went down there with us.",
"All her clothes are here, and her shoes and her hat.",
"What did it matter that they were miles from the school, or that both were wet and cold and tired to the point of collapse?",
"Would I were delivered from this state of uncertainty!",
"Men should have no minds.",
"His features, as well as his dress, wore an appearance perfectly uniform.",
"What can delay her?",
"The delay in action was by no means due to lack of class interest.",
"He tried to study, for a few minutes, but gave it up and caught up his cap.",
"It was strange to see their small fingers fly so rapidly over the pages.",
"There was one comfort.",
"Chicken and rice, chicken and rice!",
"The night wore along without relief.",
"It was some comfort, he became aware, to find that the place was fairly private.",
"The rest are all outside eating their rice.",
"Was she not also one of her little sisters that were in the world and not of it?",
"The old eyes never once suspected that the work grew faster than her own fingers moved.",
"I am always asked to sing, but any bird can sing.",
"I could hear the clock strike and that would help me bear it, I should know when night came and when morning came.",
"And then the clock struck.",
"Shall I go down or let them pound?",
"He laid his hand upon her head as if she were indeed the little child, and for a long time no words were spoken.",
"But he kept them in his fingers and tried to speak.",
"Had he spoken last, or had she?",
"Not many words were spoken.",
"Will decided that she must stay, for company, especially through the winter nights, if he had to pay her board.",
"But then of a sudden he shut his teeth hard.",
"He was disappointed that no note had accompanied the gifts.",
"That hand is full of electricity.",
"At once the hand became steady as a rock.",
"Then I found him and fought him.",
"The touch of his hand was pleasant.",
"His dreams of the man had been true.",
"After all, the scheme was a simple one.",
"I have often wondered what became of his collection.",
"They must have found me out without too much delay.",
"There was so little of it that, he reflected, its cost must have been something enormous.",
"She came on the stroke of the clock.",
"There was rather too much luxury about the meal also.",
"But on this point they held very decided opinions.",
"This would greatly help the sisters, particularly in the earlier stages of their life together in the room which they had settled to rent.",
"A long inquiry would be necessary.",
"Briefly, the inquiry was to be complete.",
"And the doctor who would soon arrive too!",
"It was a very pleasant morning.",
"He had at first spoken to them simply of an accident, a rather serious fall.",
"Although one mother was almost twice as old as the other, they became, as it were, sisters.",
"But since he had fought the cause of love he had found another faith.",
"She had to speak, and to speak with a loud voice, if she was to be attended to.",
"How easy here to see the relation of cause to effect!",
"I do deserve the daughter of a king.",
"A pound a game.",
"Still, it might have had its importance in their minds, if they had been informed of it.",
"It was a loud cry, indeed, and there was good reason for it.",
"There was no delay about that, anywhere along that line of boys.",
"Steady, now.",
"But they preferred their own ways, and what is the result?",
"We therefore resolved to start as soon as possible.",
"Her structure was the last word in size, speed, and luxury at sea.",
"In the first boats gotten away from the ship, there were not many people.",
"Few of the more noted passengers were among those saved.",
"In some foreign countries they have made much more progress than we in handling these things.",
"And his laugh was not pleasant to the ear.",
"All the world knows my opinions.",
"And her fingers came through the flowers again, feeling the empty air.",
"There was a mistake in the spelling.",
"There may be some delay in finding one to do so great a distance at this time in the morning.",
"With returning health came energy.",
"Her hands were on his hair, soft as the touch of a bird.",
"But the mind has been fed.",
"I resolved to be serious.",
"My thoughts are abroad.",
"When I take up a newspaper, it is to read the state of the opera.",
"Some people have no good of their dreams.",
"Our clock appears to have struck.",
"We resolved to be serious.",
"I have not been able to discover the cause of his influence.",
"A child is fed with milk and praise.",
"His rule appears to have been to state just so much of the truth as would leave on the minds of his readers a correct impression, at the least cost of pain to the sensitive folks he was writing about.",
"However as he could not go himself that day and did not wish to delay matters, he decided to send me instead.",
"The group here was not very large and they generally had small intense discussions.",
"However, I preferred being at the park.",
"Then, a half to one inch layer of sand should be spread.",
"The present inquiry is, then, surely made to no purpose.",
"Success produces confidence.",
"A system has been raised, which is so ready to fall to pieces of itself, that no great praise can be derived from its destruction.",
"The delay certainly increased our expenses, and, it is not unlikely, that the increase of our expenses put an end to the delay.",
"These they placed at such a distance from each other, that the enemy, if he should surprise one, might yet not discover the rest.",
"I therefore move, that the previous question may be put, which may, perhaps, gain time sufficient for a more exact inquiry upon this important subject.",
"The wind had been pretty good, but we had suffered some delay from a south wind, which headed us for a short time.",
"A portion of the dark side of the picture must be exhibited.",
"The river is very deep and rapid, so that the passage with boats is both difficult and dangerous.",
"It is rather to be wondered at that I have so much.",
"There was to be a fine concert, and all the fine people were to be there.",
"This, however, wore off.",
"A door is open between them with a wooden screen standing before it.",
"And they wondered again.",
"I wait with interest to discover if he has one.",
"I knew a word about home would comfort him, so I went on with my questions.",
"This is a big thing, and if it is possible at all it must be by some sequence of cause and effect, and this sequence it is our object to discover.",
"That would be its relation to external environment as seen by others.",
"The boats were soon held in command.",
"But his look of inquiry was returned by a sign to follow.",
"It was finally resolved that they should themselves decide on the case.",
"He immediately left the hall for his own house, with a promise of returning early on the following morning.",
"Every man carries his character in his brain.",
"The answer upset her scheme entirely.",
"How steady the river runs down?",
"Go, dreams!",
"He does not deserve any assistance.",
"They are to have neither the political nor the material comfort.",
"I do not know whether the words attributed to him were ever spoken by him.",
"It is therefore no wonder that many have more or less difficulty in making up their minds.",
"Their opinions are nothing to me.",
"For several days I had studied carefully its relation to other points in the surrounding country.",
"Even when I sleep her face is present in my dreams.",
"How far this scheme was put in practice we are unable to say, but we believe it was not accompanied by any successful result.",
"Is it to be wondered at?",
"The meeting was a source of comfort on both sides.",
"The event had impressed our minds with the awful uncertainty of time.",
"A few of her private friends were present, much to our comfort.",
"I do not know when I have had more conflict to arrive at a clear pointing.",
"Their situation was by no means pleasant.",
"Time wore slowly on.",
"The people rule it, and every man thinks for himself, so that out of the conflict of opinions the truth is usually reached.",
"He accompanied them.",
"Thus the night wore on.",
"There seemed but one thing possible and that was defeat.",
"He closed the door with firm fingers.",
"His mind turned by chance to one of those stories of which he had spoken.",
"The story expanded with relation.",
"She took his arm and he suddenly felt the touch of her warm fingers feeling for his other hand.",
"She was wearing a hat which, so far as he could judge, was almost becoming.",
"He reached for his hat.",
"The man laid his hat upon a corner of the table.",
"He laid his hand upon her fingers.",
"She held it between her fingers but declined a match.",
"Can I take off my hat?",
"He can give her more than luxury, more, even, than success.",
"Then he set his teeth and walked on.",
"She held his fingers for a moment under the table.",
"He set his teeth and turned away.",
"He pointed with steady finger.",
"The children wondered what was about to happen.",
"Suddenly he stopped and asked me if I had any matches.",
"It was said of him that he preferred to take cash for telling a lie rather than credit for telling the truth.",
"He preferred to wait for his father.",
"Then he ran off, returning in a minute with a small leather case.",
"And he went out in that cap last night.",
"Yes, I wondered that!",
"They want all the comfort they can get, poor things!",
"And tie him well.",
"Will arrive according to schedule.",
"The teeth were good.",
"He was trying to analyze his own feelings.",
"She had forgotten the hat.",
"Memory of last night was fresh in their minds.",
"The word was in both their minds.",
"She resolved then that it should come quickly.",
"But I doubt if age ever gains the victory alone.",
"It is a true praise.",
"Here is the true relation between the forms and the end of religion.",
"They were all sizes and colors.",
"I wondered how mother could say such hard words against him.",
"Constantly I wondered what my mother would say upon seeing her little daughter grown tall.",
"I was surprised upon hearing what my mother said concerning his lack of employment.",
"Like her mother, she sits upon her feet.",
"He fought as he never fought before.",
"I have formed my opinions, arrived at my conclusions.",
"He resolved to fly from the house.",
"There was something in it which reminded her of days and feelings gone, never to return.",
"Feelings, as such, he considered to be no proper subjects of praise or blame.",
"After this I continued to write papers on subjects often very much beyond my capacity, but with great benefit both from the exercise itself, and from the discussions which it led to with my father.",
"This improvement was first exhibited in a new field.",
"I sought no comfort by speaking to others of what I felt.",
"In the beginning, it did not, as a whole, by any means represent my opinions.",
"It had to some extent answered my personal purpose as a vehicle for my opinions.",
"Between the time of which I have now spoken, and the present, took place the most important events of my private life.",
"But the efforts made to defeat me were far greater on the second occasion than on the first.",
"That must have been pleasant!",
"And how good, how pleasant it was to have him with her, to talk to her, to help her!",
"I have fought against it as never woman fought against the approach of love.",
"Why delay!",
"Then suddenly she resolved that she would accept him.",
"His arms fell to his sides, and he stood and looked at her with his teeth set.",
"If there had been no delay of this, we had been there and come again by this time.",
"And, besides, thus I comfort myself as I go.",
"Thus they did several days and nights.",
"As for the second brother, he learned to build after another fashion, as he had resolved.",
"We have just said that he was only accompanied at that time by a few police agents.",
"Here and there were a few small tables.",
"The minds of all these men, we repeat, were very differently affected.",
"Some had voted for him, and reminded him of the fact.",
"A hat was sent round, and each threw into it what money he had about him.",
"I remembered the words which he had spoken to me, and I considered it might be useful to see him.",
"The crew are resolved to defend themselves and run to arms.",
"Iron arms and wooden heads.",
"Our defeat was complete, and we felt ourselves abandoned.",
"He had resolved not to go there.",
"The train, after the ordinary delay of a few minutes, again started.",
"A sharp fellow.",
"Reads the papers.",
"What advocates did they listen to?",
"He is capable of all, and he dreams of all.",
"But it may be asked, do not the teeth grow with the growth of the body?",
"Is then a mother, because her monthly periods return after her delivery, to give up nursing?",
"On his head he wore a round black cap which, if it ever had a peak, had lost it.",
"He had spoken of it before, and she had approved of it.",
"He wondered what they contained.",
"What should be the relation of such an intelligence towards us?",
"Our relation to it, whether on the scale of the individual or the universal, is the key to all that we are or ever can be.",
"He wondered if he should find her changed.",
"And on the nights when I was at home I would spend half an hour in the grounds with the dog, saying I was training him in new things, and no one paid attention.",
"The boats seen from a distance appear walking upon the land.",
"I have often wondered how it must seem to meet after half a century.",
"And he wanted to talk with her concerning what was closest to his heart.",
"Who will solve the new problem of the ages?",
"He had resolved.",
"The man was resolved again.",
"The boys were still discussing the situation.",
"This he was resolved upon.",
"His own language is spoken.",
"And how pleasant it was to count it!",
"All this is a pleasant outcome of the national character.",
"Every step in a divorce was to be encouraged, especially the first.",
"Some members of my family would have preferred the family name to be associated with the title.",
"I was the usual proud father, with added variations of my own.",
"Even the striking clock called back to her mind the hour when something should have been done for the baby.",
"But the right kind of knowing carries in its heart the doing of the truth.",
"He tried to steady himself, to jump aside.",
"One second over time, one miss of an inch, and it looked sure death.",
"He bought himself a new shirt and a cap.",
"The other was of leather, and smaller in size.",
"This lot he placed in the small leather bag.",
"A sharp crash followed.",
"Big business and the chicken a winner from the start.",
"He had reason to believe that he had achieved a good stroke, and he was resolved to make the most of it.",
"Her father is a celebrated writer.",
"The child devoted herself to her pleasant task.",
"By visiting even a few district schools we may in part discover.",
"This little girl has always liked that picture, and she has often spoken to me about it.",
"More than a year passed before I found myself again in the pleasant home of the minister.",
"We do not come here to express our individual opinions.",
"She came slightly closer and his heart began to pound harder.",
"He set his teeth now and began to count the seconds.",
"His was not a pleasant task but a necessary one.",
"To hear his almost forgotten name spoken again by her!",
"He bought her a great bunch of flowers, and she not only took it but wore it.",
"And it is not to be wondered at.",
"He minds his own business.",
"Somehow that brought him comfort.",
"He too had fought her battle.",
"It was not pleasant to admit this.",
"This had to be fought out one to one.",
"So she fought.",
"She would have fought if there had been the least chance of success.",
"He found in his religion a stay and comfort.",
"Apparently his dreams were not pleasant.",
"She could count on the fingers of one hand the times when he had said as much.",
"Every step sent a shoot of pain through him, but he set his teeth and kept moving.",
"The days were drawing out and the nights getting shorter.",
"The night wore away.",
"Operations abroad.",
"There were several variations of each class.",
"However, if additional safety is given there is compensation for this delay when the risk is great.",
"My heart gave a jump as he reminded me of this promise.",
"And I knew, too, with what they were wet.",
"It may be some comfort to him to feel that he has friends on the spot, standing by him.",
"But I reminded myself that this was impossible.",
"But man has so recently taken on this ability to think, that he has not yet gotten used to handling it.",
"Look at its teeth!",
"The common stock of knowledge gains from it no addition.",
"A great talent will discover new methods.",
"Tie them.",
"A clock struck the half hour.",
"The clock struck.",
"Her first impression was that he had come to see whether the dog had been fed.",
"That is not a pleasant position for me to find myself in.",
"There was no need to make him angry, she reflected, before she must.",
"Well might our author, therefore, find fault with their uncertainty.",
"He was very proud, and liked praise.",
"The wedding that he gave us was indeed a pleasant one.",
"This is why we were so wet.",
"It will not be with us as with so many others, who have gone away, leaving their families and never returning for them.",
"He fed well, and all had enough to wear, such as it was.",
"When we reached the place to which we had been directed, my wife not only found her mother but one of her sisters.",
"That is because I had no brothers and sisters, and my father never could realize that I was growing up.",
"He reflected a moment.",
"Certainly she was not a very pleasant person to sit near.",
"They had suffered so much from uncertainty, that there was a relief in learning the truth.",
"This directed the inquiry to the windows, one of which was not closed entirely.",
"Of the prison not one word was spoken by either.",
"Besides, I believe we could make it pretty pleasant.",
"These are supposed to be old birds, and the loss of color is attributed to age.",
"That was a luxury I was now ready for.",
"Then, hat in hand, he started down the hill.",
"It was wet and cool.",
"The chicken was a chicken such as one dreams of.",
"Round tables are just like other tables.",
"A few more months of this and it will be steady as a rock.",
"I could not, would not, run the risk of letting her leave me without the legal tie.",
"Besides, there was the legal tie.",
"Things are much cheaper across the line.",
"It had been very pleasant sitting there watching the sun set.",
"I know that bird!",
"Perhaps the baby bird was just as well out of it.",
"But all the dreams, all the happy thoughts were gone.",
"But last week he had spoken of unknown things.",
"Think how upset the doctor would be if their innocent little plot were spoken of abroad.",
"She was putting her hand far into the bird house.",
"What had her mother hoped to find in the bird house?",
"But there must be no more delay.",
"So this beautiful scheme had to be given up.",
"How loud the birds were!",
"Delay was everything in a case like this.",
"It would not be pleasant, but that made no difference!",
"Then he changed back the clock.",
"The net result of this varied inquiry was small, and produced little that could throw additional light on the matter in question.",
"He wondered about him, first of all, because of his personal appearance.",
"I am not willing that the present uncertainty as to the facts should continue.",
"The scheme ought to be simple and practical.",
"Right must be based upon the common strength, not the individual strength, of the nations upon whose concert peace will depend.",
"What occurred later cannot excuse the delay in making peace.",
"It was not even acknowledged.",
"It was a very pleasant camp.",
"After an hour or so they fed back toward the trees, and soon passed out of sight.",
"He fought for others as well as for himself.",
"What on earth was he returning for?",
"This is my bird.",
"He made his teeth meet through the side of it.",
"Yes, it was time to be going, and the thought was much on both our minds.",
"All we had to do was to go on putting one foot before the other, and we could arrive anywhere.",
"But he had already resolved to do this, and more.",
"He wore it that day.",
"He had a pleasant word for every one.",
"There was no loud talking among them.",
"There was some discussion concerning a proper form for beginning.",
"With such a belief in her mind the success of his scheme would be impossible.",
"He thought it safe to push his scheme more rapidly.",
"I trust that no meeting between us will be less pleasant than this one has been.",
"He resolved to apply to him.",
"He saw through the whole scheme now, and wondered how he had fallen so easily into it.",
"He saw, by the clock on the wall, that it was nearly train time.",
"The contrast was a sharp one, the change would be great.",
"He wondered if it was indeed only that afternoon that it had all occurred.",
"He wondered how late it was.",
"The idea was a good one, a very good one, and he resolved to act upon it without delay.",
"It was a great comfort, too, to have a living being with him for company.",
"It occurred to him that he still had matches.",
"He selected one of the matches and struck it against the rock at his side.",
"There was nothing left to him, then, save the matches, and they would not light him far.",
"Then a scheme entered his mind, a brilliant scheme by which he should get more light.",
"He resolved to act upon it without delay.",
"He wondered if it could be heard by others who might thus find where he lay.",
"He was thinking, but he thought only of pleasant things.",
"He wondered that the boy should go away and leave him for so long a time alone in his illness.",
"Uncertainty of memory.",
"Question concerning luxury.",
"He said, our judges had not gone deep in the question concerning literary property.",
"I wondered to see him write so much so easily.",
"It is her luxury, and she uses a great deal.",
"At last he resolved too.",
"We resolved to set out directly after breakfast.",
"The room where we lay was a celebrated one.",
"It was a very wet day.",
"If I should praise him, I should much more praise the nation who paid him.",
"A scheme for it was proposed.",
"It was a very heavy rain, and I was wet to the skin.",
"We were much wet.",
"He acknowledged, indeed, that the latter was much easier than the former.",
"They take passengers up the higher way, and bring them back the lower.",
"I offered them a scheme.",
"She is returning immediately.",
"Every day, every hour of delay, increases the danger.",
"She ground her strong white teeth together.",
"The old sisters had gone to bed.",
"It consists of a very fine network of cells of various sizes.",
"In them is fixed the upper set of teeth.",
"The sharp edge of the bone is easily felt just under the skin.",
"The roots of the milk teeth are much smaller than those of the second set.",
"We should exercise the greatest care in saving the teeth.",
"Let a drop of the solution fall on a piece of tissue or rice paper.",
"Other things being equal, the size and weight of the brain bear a general relation to the mental power of the individual.",
"No precise rule can be laid down concerning the amount of sleep required.",
"The light reflected from snow is a common source of injury to the eyes.",
"Literally, that which carries food.",
"He had been told that he had a heart, but no one had spoken of how it was to be directed to good.",
"Meanwhile, forget that I have spoken.",
"Where they are, he cannot be without resource.",
"Nobody minds them.",
"No parks as yet, however.",
"Her brothers wondered why she was done so quickly.",
"At last they resolved to watch, and find out who helped her.",
"Will think of some scheme to get her out of his hands.",
"Yet this sort of praise he does deserve.",
"And yet we must all own, that it is more difficult to catch a bird than a lady.",
"Relation enough in that.",
"By the tone of his voice he seemed concerned for the appearance of this new delay would have with me.",
"He could not rest, till he had been told what he had done to deserve the treatment I gave him.",
"For I do love respect, and, whether I deserve it or not, always had it, till I knew this proud beauty.",
"I myself, a man, am proud of praise.",
"Now she wondered what he was doing out there.",
"Not a word was spoken.",
"It was a wonderful bird, and she wanted it for her own.",
"Sing, bird, sing!",
"And those dear brothers and sisters, what had become of them?",
"The afternoon session wore on.",
"The girls were quite wet.",
"Probably, she reflected, her relative already knew it.",
"We also fed ourselves, but we left the money to pay for it.",
"The weather was fine now, after the storm, and the roads pleasant through the country.",
"It was the first she had spoken in some time.",
"The poverty of the poor she had seen in her own village seemed comfort and luxury by contrast.",
"Good counsel and good comfort, by my faith.",
"The woman reflected.",
"In one way this delay has been a good thing.",
"It was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn, and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.",
"His sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion.",
"One wondered if it were a living thing.",
"Force must be the common principle of positive and negative electricity.",
"He spoke apart with his friends concerning the battle.",
"The peak was very sharp.",
"The game of war is like a game of tables.",
"Sharp it was at the head, tough and great, and very welcome at need in the press of battle.",
"After these words no more was spoken until the rising of the sun.",
"They asked of them concerning whom they sought, and if for peace they had come within the camp.",
"The fingers came away red.",
"He never has anything on his mind but his hair and a hat.",
"At least he thought it was his hat.",
"But he accompanied her.",
"Time enough to cross that bridge when the crucial moment should arrive.",
"But the delay was a mere matter of form.",
"Here was praise indeed.",
"They deserve it.",
"For if the changes of the lower animals are so wonderful, and so difficult to discover, why should not there be changes in the higher animals far more wonderful, and far more difficult to discover?",
"It may be a relation.",
"I just held him there under the lights, and we looked at one another without a word spoken.",
"I spoke loud too.",
"Yet during every hour of the long days, and during every hour of the still longer nights, she has been with me.",
"He never told me himself one word concerning this story.",
"But we have scored off him most surely.",
"She will turn any man around her pretty fingers if he gives way to her.",
"What manner of man, I wondered, was this new patient of mine?",
"I reflected a few moments.",
"First, as to the teeth.",
"But what did they discover?",
"Art is therefore popular, and appeals to every one, but to those most who live in the great ideas on which it is based.",
"There were very few to encourage him or comfort him.",
"They deserve praise for their energy.",
"It is as pleasant to hear as to see him.",
"This was indeed a sharp thing.",
"How the matter was fought out we cannot tell.",
"Changing wet clothing.",
"Few girls comfortable, at home or abroad.",
"Walking abroad.",
"Going abroad in the open air.",
"Different opinions about sleep.",
"The teeth.",
"There is a very general mistake abroad on this subject.",
"Ought they not to go abroad, at least occasionally?",
"I have already observed that we may begin to feed children when the teeth begin to appear.",
"The first food given should be precisely of the kind which has been recommended for those children who are fed by the hand.",
"To me, this seems to deserve serious consideration.",
"Nature seems to direct to this, by giving them no teeth till about that time.",
"But I have spoken on this subject elsewhere.",
"And it is with a view to some such effect, generally, that medical writers have spoken in their favor.",
"Grown people drink, whether dry or not, because they have discovered a way of making drink pleasant.",
"Cold water is almost always preferred.",
"He resolved to make one effort for his life.",
"There was a drop of comfort, at least, in this intelligence.",
"With a heavy heart I accompanied my friend.",
"He never could have stood upon his legs, that bird.",
"His teeth and his friends gone, why should he keep the peace, and be civil?",
"He was not fit to walk abroad.",
"The colors were applied when the composition was still wet.",
"The construction of boats varied according to the purpose for which they were intended.",
"Of this publication I know nothing, and can discover nothing.",
"What was pleasant before, they have made regular.",
"I have not been able to discover whether he will then die or not.",
"And now to conclude.",
"Then she passed by him, though he would have spoken further.",
"At these words the cap which the poor girl held fell from her hand.",
"He always called them his children, and, indeed, his relation to them had more of the character of the parent than of the teacher.",
"Of course, I put on my hat and walked out also.",
"He turned red in the face at that, got the bill directly, and put on his hat.",
"He devoted his time to huge historical paintings, and the public would neither buy them nor pay to see them when they were exhibited.",
"I at once resolved to make an effort to reach him, and in due time found an opportunity.",
"At the time the opinions of people were found to differ.",
"With our own experience fresh in our minds, I have no doubt the balance of the class had an easy passage.",
"The writer was selected to make the presentation speech, as he had known him from his childhood.",
"The following summer was one of great comfort.",
"I prove to her, in figures, that it is much cheaper for her and the family to live out of town, and for me to come down and see them, occasionally.",
"For an ordinary road machine this is a high average over so long a stretch, but the weather was perfect and the machine working like a clock.",
"A strike is an expensive luxury.",
"I have spoken of this, because it was a state of feeling new to me, the occasion being new.",
"Praise to the end!",
"She does this over and over again so slowly and so carefully, it would seem, as if she expected the money to grow under her fingers.",
"She had done nothing to deserve it.",
"His voice, too, was a pleasant voice, and gave a value to all he said.",
"The word was spoken.",
"The words have been spoken.",
"Why then delay?",
"His teeth were set.",
"With that name there came a world of comfort to him.",
"Would she be glad, or sorry, he wondered?",
"There was a terrible comfort in it.",
"He resolved that he would be equal to the occasion, whatever might occur.",
"Indeed, he wondered within himself why she had remained so long.",
"But the question is, will it pay in comfort or economy to do this?",
"How the people wondered!",
"But it is under such circumstances that great minds reveal themselves.",
"He resolved, therefore, in order to carry this important post, to lead fresh troops to the attack.",
"For some reason or other it was necessary that they should be without the comfort, and help, and protection, of her presence in this world.",
"There is enough to do for all men, if their minds are directed right!",
"Why, on this day, the great battle was fought on this ground.",
"We choose our doctor upon faith, for how little independent judgment can we form concerning his capacity?",
"The first year he went abroad with me he could hardly draw at all.",
"He was not at all the kind of person who would stay a concert out if he did not like it.",
"Sharp, is, of course, the true reading.",
"The reading of the common copies is to be preferred.",
"He still, however, wondered.",
"I had a sense of comfort, but not of security.",
"But I was wet and cold.",
"There had been no change, a fact which gave him a certain comfort, he could not have said why.",
"I resolved to make an end of the mystery if possible.",
"Extend this to all animals and plants, and the same thing will hold good concerning them all.",
"He sat up with his father there night after night, and heard the church clock sound all the hours as the sick man lay waiting for his last.",
"He had, of course, spoken to her scores of times in his shop, but he was not supposed to have seen her till that minute.",
"This time he was late, and did not arrive till it was nearly at an end.",
"If a man does not find that food and light and the air are pleasant, it is of no use to debate with himself.",
"Then there was the matter of delay.",
"Out of my brief experience with boats I know I never did.",
"But never one came near enough to wet us.",
"It had no lines, except in so far that it was sharp at both ends.",
"Man, being more perfect than the sun, makes a clock that keeps regular time.",
"Back to the house I went for the book on teeth.",
"And they accompanied him to the ship.",
"Let him sing praise.",
"Will he delay long over them?",
"Is it not the one who sits at the table?",
"There were also other boats with him.",
"When I saw her, I wondered greatly.",
"One day he found a poor green bird lying on the ground with its leg broken.",
"We had never spoken.",
"For the first time have I spoken.",
"And there was no discussing the matter.",
"I reflected a moment.",
"For opinions I by no means always go with them.",
"I form my opinions myself.",
"So with the relationship between man and woman, the marriage laws and divorce.",
"He also looked at her, but no word was spoken for a minute.",
"Now that my husband is dead I discover that the frequent visitors to our house came to see him and not me.",
"He had made no inquiry.",
"Neither had spoken a word of what both had observed.",
"My feeling was that this would happen, and I pulled out my watch to see if it were not nearly time for him to arrive.",
"The marks of the teeth have shown that.",
"She has spoken truly and to the point.",
"Wet science was what did it.",
"I wish that life was an opera.",
"Sweet bird!",
"I was very glad to be back again in this dear place, and smell the wet forest in the morning.",
"That, I think, makes things more pleasant.",
"It is the natural expression of real praise.",
"I see, if I could only get to work, that we could live here with comfort, almost with luxury.",
"I do not know how it would have been with me had the sisters not been there.",
"Very soon I shall have no opinions left.",
"All these things, however, are pleasant to me.",
"The point, however, is much on our minds just now.",
"This, so far as I could discover, was all she had to do.",
"A cap.",
"Money, currency.",
"Coming back, returning from transportation.",
"He had a small hat on his head, and he was not badly dressed.",
"Is it not somewhat important to make up our minds on this matter?",
"Who is to do the pleasant and clean work, and for what pay?",
"As they walked they were discussing some matter.",
"I must state that the cook had only lived with me a week, and, though I had seen his wife, I had never spoken to her.",
"I became convinced, after experience, that money is not the representative of labor, but, in the majority of cases, the representative of violence, or of especially complicated sharp practices founded on violence.",
"Though very dark, it is luxury after last night.",
"Even if a valuable bird or animal falls near one, he will not go to pick it up."],

"How then can we secure for him that the new experiences presented to him in school will be in line with the old?",
"Indeed it is safe to say of many of these devices that they prove the fact that children are not ready for reading.",
"The public would do well to secure both of these important works.",
"Our tale is told.",
"While they were still at it the call of time sounded.",
"It is in the rain that this tale begins.",
"There was a dark mark on his shoulder.",
"He had always the hills at the back of his head.",
"Then I told him the whole tale.",
"Suddenly he caught my shoulder, and pulled me to the ground.",
"They told me one could see the hills from near at hand, and a boy that I asked said I would get a rare view if I went to the rise beyond the river.",
"And the next second I became aware that there was some one among the horses.",
"Now that we were all but out of the hills I was mad to get forward.",
"That brought my right shoulder close to his mouth, and he bit me to the bone.",
"And her thoughts went on in other directions.",
"All this time there had been people passing, entering by the many doors.",
"Whether it is order or whether it is license, it is according to their own will.",
"Then he who had been her guide, and told her his tale, came forward and stood by the side of the newly come.",
"They had not liked it, and the horses had not liked it.",
"My father went to his room early, which was not his habit.",
"I went straight up to him and put my hand on his shoulder.",
"The difference was of little consequence.",
"Just deal boards, I expect!",
"When several offices fall on the same day, only one office, the one of highest rank or most important, is said.",
"However, some churches celebrated it on other dates.",
"Printed it in the paper, for all to read.",
"These products are, to a great extent, such as would result from the burning of so much wood.",
"I want to earn a commission before I assume it.",
"He can see him nowhere.",
"Here they were secure.",
"He is in his own room and secure from surprise.",
"No one could dispute it.",
"The horses?",
"The horses were long since gone.",
"This could be done only by reaching the water and getting into it far from the point where they proposed to leave it.",
"And any extraordinary man can do it quite as well as an ordinary woman.",
"Thus they denied the power of a majority to alter even the form of government.",
"He took up his pack and beat it, saying nothing and looking sick.",
"The command brought an immediate protest.",
"New men had gathered.",
"I have tried arguing.",
"The girl paid no attention to these remarks.",
"My face was burning.",
"Parks helped me into my coat and opened the door for me.",
"He caught up coat and hat and started for the door.",
"I was recalled to confirm his story.",
"What was the use of arguing with a man like that?",
"It was half full of the red liquid.",
"He was a little surprised at the strength of protest in his own heart.",
"He spoke over his shoulder to her.",
"Then she managed to say in a fairly composed tone.",
"The people ate up all their food.",
"It was loaded with food for all the people.",
"One day they saw some high rocks with pictures painted on them.",
"The end of each tail was like that of a fish.",
"He gathered a good deal of rice in his garden that year.",
"He was always playing hide and seek.",
"They crossed them this way and that.",
"They wanted some horses.",
"He heard the steps of horses.",
"He saw his brother riding on one horse, and leading another.",
"Sometimes they ate horses.",
"They used what was called a burning glass.",
"So he took out his burning glass.",
"He gathered many eggs of birds.",
"This would break up the inside of the egg.",
"Then he would blow into one of the holes.",
"That would blow the inside of the egg out through the other hole.",
"At last the great books were printed.",
"But the horses were tired, and the men had to get down, and follow the dogs on foot.",
"After standing still a minute, the woman took one of the boards, and went off quickly.",
"So was his coat.",
"He loaded it.",
"No great harm would result if it were.",
"Importance, consequence, moment.",
"Name the different kinds of vehicles.",
"Name the elements of which water is composed.",
"Of this fact there are several eye witnesses now living.",
"I answered him I crossed the waters to come here, and I am willing to cross them to return.",
"If they had urged us very much to go, I would have gone.",
"There was no use in trying to hide the marks.",
"Thought he might get the track thrown across the hole, perhaps!",
"For all that, he must hold out and he began his labor in the burning sun.",
"Just now I have some money that does not earn much.",
"Half covered by snow, she found his gray horse, dead, killed by the fall.",
"I crossed the room, and, opening it a little more, went in.",
"Nevertheless he is thrown upon his own resources to do what he may for himself.",
"It has never been printed.",
"My own position was such that I could look over her shoulder and see as she saw.",
"The picture appears now to be genuine.",
"Why have no tail to speak of?",
"And now opens the war drama set with the same scene everywhere.",
"Will it need a campaign to secure for our army this efficient service?",
"The full power of our men must be thrown into military effort.",
"How can women aid in making secure the national position?",
"Still it counted a hit.",
"At a signal the men gathered around the man who appeared to be the leader.",
"He felt a sharp pain in his left shoulder.",
"He wanted to get loose so he could make another attempt to rescue his friend.",
"The operator sent the message.",
"It was loaded.",
"He gave the necessary directions and the boat moved off.",
"Certainly it can do us no harm.",
"He counted the clubs.",
"He was aware that the police had been there on the same mission, but his experience had often shown that valuable information was to be gathered after the police had been over the ground.",
"Remember that the body of the victim was fully dressed when it was discovered by the police, and that none of the electric lights were burning.",
"The door of the house was open, and the light was burning in the hall.",
"She found the front door open and the electric light burning in the hall.",
"When she arrived at the house she found the front door open and the lights burning.",
"As they were to be called as witnesses they would not be allowed in court until after they had given their evidence.",
"Those witnesses who had given evidence at the police court were called and repeated their statements.",
"The hat and coat were gone.",
"I took a quick resolve.",
"I remember the hour because I was expecting my husband every minute, just as I am now.",
"It had another point of interest, or, rather the wing had to which it was attached.",
"Yet such witnesses may exist.",
"I was in an extraordinary position, myself.",
"Were we about to be made witnesses of another?",
"I carried a small bag with me, but no coat or hat.",
"This will be his explanation of this extraordinary murder.",
"Reaching down, I took it.",
"He meant no harm now.",
"A big fire was burning in front of them.",
"It urged him to come quickly.",
"Shoulder to shoulder they continued to circle.",
"The pack made no sound.",
"He was one of the pack.",
"Then they found that the finger of sand reaching out into the river had saved them.",
"They met shoulder to shoulder.",
"This was not the way of the pack.",
"His shoulder was broken.",
"The huge dog was thrown from his feet.",
"He was big and gray and old.",
"He paid no attention to the meat that was thrown under his nose.",
"He had no desire to harm him.",
"In general there is little art in these stories, and in style they are far below other collections celebrated through the entire world.",
"They entered the garden and ate a good deal.",
"All of a sudden the image of an armed man appeared to them.",
"They arrived at a tree, divided their bread, and ate it.",
"In the night he took his egg and ate it.",
"They gave him something to eat, and he ate little.",
"He gave him some of it, and they ate.",
"He gave him some, and they ate.",
"I could not well make protest after this explanation, and, in fact, it seemed to me that there was little choice of position.",
"She did look gray this morning.",
"I was there, and I still live to tell my tale.",
"But she was nowhere visible, and at last I gave up the search and went to bed.",
"It was pointed out that we had less than half the horses we really needed, and those we had were so weak from the diet of leaves to which they had been reduced that they could do little work.",
"Hear my tale, nevertheless.",
"But some of us are people of consequence.",
"At one side some dead bodies of armed men are visible.",
"Can a nation be really effective, really strong, really secure, without this?",
"There is nothing in the mere fact of exchange to alter those figures.",
"And it may be just as well to consider these possibilities.",
"The rank and file were not slow to appreciate this.",
"The rank and file knew something more than this.",
"The horses became fit and strong and were ready for the war to be carried into open country.",
"All horses had been sent back in the course of the afternoon, and when the light failed the retirement began.",
"All kinds of devices were tried.",
"It was an extraordinary sight.",
"The burning is going on.",
"But the impression of it from a distance was none the less genuine.",
"I had many fears.",
"His other works of the period are of minor consequence.",
"He lived in a glass case, and could not hide himself by his habit of burning blue lights.",
"From his mouth come our hopes and fears.",
"He quickly ate it, and then pulled another and ate that, and then another, and still others, until he could eat no more.",
"How then should he ever be able to get to the hills, still far, far away beyond that water?",
"Every minute lost is of consequence.",
"Yet she promised to tell me the truth if I could but secure her release!",
"Even that document did not account for the length he had gone to secure the release of the woman I now loved in secret.",
"This is one of those practical arguments which are always more interesting than those which depend upon theories and opinions.",
"And therefore she taught him only to tell a smooth and likely tale of those matters, warning him not to vary from it.",
"This statement has given rise to much dispute.",
"He had shown extraordinary talent in his government of the native population, and his rule had been a complete success.",
"In several instances we came near being lost.",
"It began to rain, but that made no difference to the burning.",
"But horses and men and fragments of men lay dead around it.",
"I could understand his depression, now that he had come back to it.",
"Yet not a hair had been turned from riding.",
"I remember expecting he would be glad to see me.",
"And he turned again to his coat.",
"No, no, do not protest.",
"He is out to receive a message I am expecting, which can hardly be delivered at the front door.",
"Was there nothing that would give him genuine concern?",
"Then the light died, and my father continued giving his directions.",
"One of them is loaded.",
"Neither was loaded.",
"When I heard her name I recognized her at once from her photographs.",
"In fact, any one whose interests are affected ought to secure legal assistance.",
"Grant understand that we regard him as rather outside the scope of our inquiry.",
"Take the horses into the city!",
"Look at his horses!",
"Let us hide our heads and shut up the page.",
"Many and many a tale had the pair so gone through.",
"As a rule the head of each family owns the house in which he lives and the ground on which it is built.",
"These forces made up the left wing.",
"They continued their instances till he came to his seat.",
"Surely there was no harm in asking for that.",
"Instances are so numerous that it is impossible to do more than quote some of the most important, as recorded in our own and other countries.",
"Such were the true elements of the dispute.",
"The people, however, who loved him, followed, armed, to see that he came to no harm.",
"She still wore her hat and the gray wrap.",
"The man made no protest.",
"For me, I was never so affected with any human tale.",
"This is choice and genuine, and so are many, many more.",
"What makes it the more extraordinary is, that the man never saw me in his life that I know of.",
"But I must look on him as one of the most extraordinary persons of the age.",
"Those little things were of more consequence than we supposed.",
"They have been carefully gathered, and often given elsewhere, and there is no need for me to repeat them.",
"These remarks, however, by the way.",
"Her dress was of light printed stuff, clean and good.",
"Here he was in a strange yellow land with no idea of where he was going or where to hide.",
"He would not have said that if he did not think that the boy would get home to tell the tale.",
"But no harm done, right?",
"Have we no tendency to the latter condition?",
"But there was also another reason which counted for much.",
"But before reaching his majority he turned to natural history.",
"Was her life thrown away?",
"Let no one think that the resolve cost her nothing.",
"She had launched into the society of the world, and to a great extent she did as they did.",
"But later, as we shall see, the whole establishment took part.",
"Her light was placed so that many could see its steady and bright burning.",
"Her old habit of early rising had of course to be abandoned.",
"What harm now do I do?",
"He was hurt, but he was man enough to hide it.",
"Then he slowly sat forward in his chair and looked back over his shoulder.",
"They have never done any harm.",
"A girl had crossed the river in front of him at a smart pace.",
"I saw a gray hair this morning.",
"Besides, what harm can he actually do to us?",
"They are being urged on by some one.",
"He will do all the harm of which he is capable at once.",
"They had never had much in common, although circumstances had thrown their lives together.",
"His face was gray and terrible.",
"Why should he be, since he was expecting to go into business?",
"The town had other churches.",
"We want to make people like the churches, not hate them.",
"All concerned have agreed as to the needs and possibilities.",
"But she came back to her first idea about the home churches.",
"They all gathered round her.",
"Not that there was any harm in that girl.",
"With flat fish, this is not of such consequence, as they will keep longer.",
"The shoulder.",
"Newspaper, or paper that has been printed on, should never be used for this purpose.",
"When the above directions are attended to, the wine cannot fail to be good.",
"It would appear that this people had rather a tendency to the useful, than to the beautiful.",
"He caused them to be treated with the consideration due to their rank.",
"So I went to my good old minister, and repeated the remarks, as nearly as I could remember them, to him.",
"I love my country, and I love horses.",
"These wonderful horses need to be driven by fine hands.",
"In order to get at a solution we must fix somewhat more definitely the notion of fine art and its scope.",
"It was printed, but no copy of it is now to be found.",
"But he could find her nowhere, neither in the hall nor in the garden, and he got no answer to his loud, repeated calls.",
"His mother had already told him how well his voice sounded and that she wanted him to develop it later on.",
"How fine it sounded!",
"The boy might want to drive about and the horses might begin to jump.",
"Papers printed under these conditions would have to be sold for one dollar each, and there would not be much profit in it at that.",
"They were set up and made up in the afternoon and generally printed in the early part of the evening.",
"As soon as a sufficient number of papers had been printed I attempted to carry them to the counting room and place them on sale.",
"All were loaded down.",
"From top to bottom it was one mass of holes.",
"They are men, and have pulled me out of tight holes when I was green at this game, and they did it at the risk of their lives.",
"Many horses also were captured.",
"Horses fell with the men.",
"Nearly all our horses have fallen.",
"Every armed individual will be put to death.",
"An object lesson of the power and possibilities of the great fighting machine must be given somewhere.",
"After a battle these plates are gathered from the dead and from these the death lists are made out.",
"Every moment counted.",
"The others gathered round him, their heads together, looking and wondering what he would bring forth.",
"So he looked up the road and down the road to see who might come, until at last he saw someone drawing near, riding upon a horse.",
"As we crossed the bridge we saw the cat again down below us.",
"There can be no harm in trying to understand both.",
"I am speaking rather of gains which cannot be counted as guns are counted, or measured as land is measured, but which are none the less real and important.",
"It lies rather in the habit of mutual help and mutual trust.",
"But to our tale.",
"After this, in order to let the soldiers hear and be witnesses of the terms they had made, they called them together and made known to them in advance all that it was proper and safe to tell them.",
"After doing this he armed his men for battle.",
"He opened the door, and in the square of light the horses stopped.",
"They had not counted on this.",
"He then spoke in words whose meaning I could not guess, but the tone sounded to me as that of inquiry.",
"Reaching the spot, I looked over the edge and with some trouble discovered what had happened.",
"The nation is ready, armed to the teeth.",
"Besides which, weapons are being gathered and money collected.",
"The man removed his coat and threw it into the car.",
"A step sounded behind them.",
"He helped his daughter into the car, and then put on his long coat.",
"It was a small circle, burning slowly.",
"My neighbors left their own burning fields to save ours.",
"What a relief to hide her own!",
"She was shocked.",
"When he came out he was white, but apparently composed.",
"The water is rough, dark gray, and cold.",
"Gray forms closing in!",
"I was a little bit moved, but kept it to myself and ate on.",
"I urged them to sit.",
"Can the study of truth do harm?",
"In all probability he really had need of my services, and was therefore glad enough of this opportunity to secure them.",
"But before we attempt reaching this, we must attend to those men left below on the boat.",
"The one forward has pushed off loaded.",
"She crossed to me, her hand upon my arm.",
"It was a beautiful sight to see those rare animals, gathered from all over the world, eating grass together, in perfect peace, in this new country.",
"An hour or so later he heard horses.",
"But less at her than at her pack.",
"King seemed not to notice whether she ate or not.",
"King, riding ahead as usual, was not quite so far in advance, and did not have his back turned square upon her.",
"He was going on on foot, expecting her to take his horse.",
"But he urged her on.",
"King came back slowly and sat down on his pack.",
"He was shocked to learn how cold she was.",
"Even if they should find it, I can show her where to hide.",
"Only now was he entering.",
"He was expecting that.",
"She had never seen in his eyes a look like the one now burning in them.",
"But if it moves itself, it will be converted to itself.",
"Or can any one properly know himself without knowing the rank he holds in the scale of being?",
"All day he had come down under the wing of the storm, hoping to win past it, but finding it traveling with him until night.",
"All else failing, he can hide.",
"There is always more life abroad in the winter hills than one looks to find, and much more in evidence than in summer weather.",
"The holes however, were not large enough for the children to fall through.",
"That was her only protest.",
"The big show opens tonight, and every seat is sold.",
"He has been thrown into prison.",
"But he thought it was no harm to worry other things.",
"Her tail was enormous.",
"Many of them dying and being thrown into the sea.",
"The president made some remarks after she had finished, and then every one had to vote.",
"After a time, the men got to understand how to drive a coach, and the horses did not suffer so much.",
"I went back to my bed, for I knew they would do no harm.",
"I think I know more about horses than dogs.",
"I wondered very much whether they would be able to do all those extraordinary things, but it turned out that they did.",
"The fire must have reached the horses.",
"The recognition was mutual.",
"What harm could he see in it?",
"Nothing extraordinary about him in that respect.",
"Here and there work of this kind has been successfully carried out in selected instances.",
"They were soon gathered around the table and busy.",
"Everything seemed secure so far as he could see.",
"It was a short time after this that they heard the boom of a gun.",
"It is not my habit to call on people who do not care to see me.",
"For them this book is printed.",
"Perhaps it will never rise to its full possibilities.",
"As full as an egg is of meat.",
"To whom they were addressed, we only know in a few instances.",
"It is a pretty tale.",
"That tale is a long one.",
"Then he gave me a crack on the back and he put his arm around my shoulder awful nice and friendly like, and it made me kind of proud because I knew him.",
"Then he went on and this is what he told me, keeping his arm around my shoulder and every minute or so listening and looking out over the water.",
"And even suppose he did, what was the harm?",
"We saw the big day boat go up and all her lights were burning, it was so dark on the river.",
"All around the lake was a kind of gray border and I guess it showed how much the water had gone down.",
"Who wants to volunteer to go back through the mountains?",
"It sounded awful clear in the night.",
"Of consequence the company of the one necessarily involved that of the other.",
"I will not say to what I may myself be urged.",
"I have counted every moment.",
"Such an attack must have followed some prior dispute.",
"It seemed a fit setting for his fears.",
"He gave no thought to that, riding toward his experiment.",
"Her eyes slowly gathered his meaning.",
"I wish I had kept the references, but all I have is the thought I gathered.",
"Or counted too many?",
"The boys could not set their minds on their lessons, and as a consequence got some poor marks.",
"He said he was both surprised and shocked at what had occurred, and added that if they needed his aid he would come on at once.",
"He did not care for it, and so he had thrown it away.",
"God would not alter his moral laws for him or any man.",
"Now let such people, if there be any such here, seriously consider the harm which they are doing to their own characters.",
"They can do no harm.",
"I guarantee that.",
"He ate while the other men were present.",
"And then he remembered that horses were outside of his education entirely.",
"This key opens it.",
"The safe was, in fact, dedicated simply to the storage of documents.",
"He began to go round and round after his own tail.",
"The cook said she was not going to allow this, so one day she called the dog to her in a most friendly way, and held out half an egg in her hand.",
"The more that die, the more they earn.",
"Some dispute, some battle, seemed to be in progress.",
"This now struck him with extraordinary force.",
"He recalled everything that he had seen and heard in that house.",
"I think that they hide at the bottom because the water is so cold in winter.",
"Under the armed peace there can be no confidence.",
"There could be no confidence because there was mutual fear.",
"All this is beyond dispute.",
"At the same time, it was difficult to secure the practical application of the principle of equal commercial opportunity.",
"I refer to these brothers because they expressed one of the leading theories of the new education.",
"Burning questions all, if we would find out the causes of crime.",
"It is valuable also as a habit.",
"No, I protest.",
"It was not too late, and he was out of the house before there was any chance for further remarks from the girls.",
"Look out for the boom.",
"It was of less importance, perhaps, because they had heard it all before, and had gathered a curious collection of ideas concerning the man under whose direction they were to get their new stocks of learning.",
"For instance, the order to open private mail caused a general protest.",
"These women, in many instances, have been guilty of violence.",
"Suddenly throughout the town all this hell was let loose.",
"Will his hair be gray?",
"That tells his tale.",
"He had no reason to wish her harm.",
"He looked up slowly, expecting perhaps to find her looking elsewhere.",
"None saw when he ate them.",
"It would do her no harm.",
"We are both great readers in different directions.",
"They covered him over with a coat of white paint.",
"None told his tale.",
"I see no harm in people making much of themselves in that sense of the word.",
"All are genuine.",
"Gray had had his day.",
"Deep and genuine feeling, correct judgment, and the most perfect good taste, distinguish her play in every character.",
"The crime which had now thrown him into the hands of justice was the recent murder of a second wife, and the chief evidence against him was his own son.",
"Instead I asked for directions to the bank and set out.",
"By then it was lunch time and we all ate together.",
"So now it stood nearly at shoulder length.",
"Their tail is very strong and helps them in swimming.",
"Such is the consequence.",
"He was tall, and remarkable for extraordinary strength.",
"Of this dispute I have found no particular account.",
"For who will support those from whom no mutual support can be expected?",
"They find too frequently only the form of religion in the east, as we do in the eastern churches.",
"This is considered an extraordinary high price.",
"But such instances, though we must wonder at them, are not rare.",
"I am invited to conversations.",
"Resolve never to be poor.",
"The letter is of consequence only to me.",
"He was up and very composed.",
"As I ate my breakfast that morning he told me of his good year.",
"It would be fine, riding off on the big train.",
"It had been observed by more than one of us that these had of late suffered from the depression of their editor.",
"But we affected to agree that something must be done, which sounded very well indeed.",
"Then she stopped suddenly with a low cry and pointed to the right wing, which directly faced them.",
"He did not add that he had personally offered to guarantee the title.",
"Nowhere could he find her, and no voice answered when he called.",
"I try to hide it.",
"But he must have rank, just as much as a doctor.",
"The consequence was soon apparent.",
"Mark fears not the truth!",
"The danger was in entering.",
"Perhaps no novel of our times was worst printed than the first edition of this work.",
"Her sister naturally asked an explanation of so extraordinary a procedure.",
"In a few minutes the horses might have been suffering for air, but surely not for exercise.",
"If birds were not plenty, he would throw up a chip, and sometimes his hat, by way of shooting on the wing.",
"Their tale was soon told.",
"And what harm if it is?",
"They looked round, there was not a loose bit near.",
"It gives free scope to the strong to maintain their strength and develop it.",
"It cannot be based upon mutual fear.",
"The letter was not meant to be printed.",
"We must guarantee to them the same freedom we claim for ourselves.",
"The latter I learned from his frequent remarks to me.",
"This would be the means of establishing their credit as men of business.",
"I thought I saw, as in the vision of light, as if a people would be gathered in that neighborhood to the knowledge of the truth.",
"We thought it would not do to pass through the country in this state of depression, without trying to remove the cause.",
"It is the first opportunity we have had for serious conversation in this place, and I hope it was to mutual comfort.",
"Various individuals then related their experience, one after the other, as is usual in the more private religious meetings in these churches.",
"The horses were started and the great vehicle began to move.",
"We have all come to see her launched.",
"The papers printed this morning are full of it.",
"The church which had been converted into a hospital was set on fire.",
"In a few seconds the great gun was again loaded.",
"We were both thrown upon the world about the same time.",
"She was more composed now.",
"I seem to be playing hide and seek with myself.",
"The little party gathered together at the end of the common table.",
"Slowly she looked around over her shoulder, her face as white as death.",
"We must alter all that, dear.",
"He turned her loose to come to me, and he had us watched.",
"We had managed to save our horses.",
"Did she protest?",
"The old man took off his coat.",
"But when he spoke his voice was the same, and his features were composed.",
"He ate his food and he went to bed, only to do poor things in the way of sleeping.",
"It sounded a very plain, ordinary story.",
"Most extraordinary!",
"As he spoke, a figure crossed the window passing between it and the light.",
"Walking quickly, to escape the heat, he crossed the street to the station.",
"Steps sounded behind them.",
"Her arms went into the mass to the shoulder.",
"The morning was warm and he had not put on a coat.",
"To secure it he would have been required to leave the horses.",
"That one second gave the other horses the start.",
"He reached over and picked up the license.",
"I cannot doubt that my readers will be interested in such fragments as the scope and design of my book will allow me to offer.",
"He has written another similar volume, but much larger, and of a somewhat extraordinary character.",
"His horses were not difficult to drive.",
"How loose and easy hence to go!",
"We talked of things we had heard them say in their conversations.",
"Entering the house, I stood close against the wall.",
"Coming to my side, she offered me the only printed matter we had in our home.",
"He has crossed me before, and I will choose an opportunity to tell him my mind.",
"The devices were good, and I never had any reason to change my opinion of them.",
"It is in this way that all my books have been composed.",
"I was not the first to protest.",
"It seemed to her extraordinary that she should have met him so often, still more extraordinary the offer he had made that morning.",
"One of them has got loose.",
"He looked over his shoulder.",
"She looked round her and over her shoulder.",
"These hills are rather trying to those who are not used to them.",
"She got into her habit quickly and went down to him.",
"And this said he gathered to him his feet and died.",
"He asked them if they had not a note of directions for the way.",
"The door was shut, the steps were thrown up, and they drove off.",
"At that moment people generally believed, and we ourselves believed, in this judgment, which, as we have seen, was not the genuine judgment.",
"A gun in our hands is a protest.",
"The vehicles having been loaded they set off.",
"A draft protest was drawn up.",
"These were thrown on the ground, no one would take them.",
"Those who have passed through that extraordinary minute will not forget it.",
"A man is expecting nothing.",
"When he needed it, he found it, armed and ready to serve him.",
"A noise sounded in the shop.",
"He was a marked man, he had to hide himself.",
"I simply tell the tale.",
"What witnesses did they question?",
"I protest.",

"On a committee it was his habit to go to the bottom of things.",
"Yet the collections were not fully completed before the end of my term.",
"Loose horses in the road make trouble.",
"On country roads there is but one way to pass horses without risk, and that is let the horses pass the machine.",
"Many with horses get out and walk at the worst places.",

"Why cannot I alter it?",
"The doctor sounded her carefully, and then sat down without speaking.",
"But it must be a very small audience, composed of those who love me and whom I love.",

"And yet even here I am going to pick holes.",
"I to the hills.",
"But that is a consequence, not a cause.",
"Excuse these remarks.",
"A burning.",
"Religious, converted.",
"An egg.",
"A woman, in any rank of life, ought to know whatever her husband is likely to know, but to know it in a different way.",
"This feeling was genuine and very powerful.",
"But it is impossible to hide ourselves, and they do see us.",
"What harm is there in that?",
"Its revenues were estimated in rice.",
"I did quite the wrong thing in riding here.",
"Very few horses are kept here.",

"The question was on every tongue.",
"I had to hear those sentences again.",
"My tongue would not speak the necessary words, and it was not made to.",
"A searching question.",
"What would be his reply?",
"Whatever the cause, he let these expressions of feeling pass.",
"So was the silence which followed it.",
"This called for no reply and I made none.",
"He could detect nothing that reminded him of their hated presence in the air.",
"The sky was filled with stars.",
"He knew that she was speaking to him, and he drew himself a foot toward her.",
"From the frozen river came her reply, and he went to her.",
"For a moment there was silence.",
"Then he turned, laughing.",
"They agreed to keep silence between themselves.",
"Our father killed us and buried us here.",
"The wise one let her part live, and it walked on one foot and had only one wing.",
"This is what I was laughing at.",
"They cut off his head and buried his body.",
"When we were thus left alone a silence fell upon us.",
"To this I could make no reply.",
"No cause of future wars must be allowed to remain.",
"What we must try to do now is to limit the consequences of these mistakes in a changed spirit.",
"It was all arranged.",
"There is a charming place just without.",
"My father started as though he had been struck across the face, but he was too far gone in anger to listen to the voice of reason.",
"What possibilities lay in the profession of arms!",
"I could have bit my tongue the moment the words were out.",
"The hours passed slowly and quietly.",
"I had never seen him so moved, and I caught the infection of his anger.",
"But it was not this which drew my eyes.",
"It was the war party preparing for the attack.",
"All was silence for a space.",
"He threatened to cut out my tongue.",
"Kiss me.",
"Peace, aged woman, peace!",
"Why, then, do wars occur?",
"Probably wars will still for many a century continue, though less frequent we hope.",
"But we must not go to the edge on our right so as to look down into the valley below.",
"He does not reply.",
"But, of course, at any moment he might reply.",
"The men at the heart of things could only set their teeth, keep silence and give no information that could help the enemy.",
"Of course mistakes were made.",
"The right men are sent to the right places, and everything is done quietly.",
"It has all been so quietly done!",
"A meeting was at length arranged between them.",
"Close by, down in the green valley before him, there was something else to attract his attention, and this was a large group of men and horses.",
"She put her hand on him, then drew him up to her side, with his feet on the stone she was standing by.",
"Her reply disappointed me.",
"This reply surprised me.",
"Indeed, any person standing at the spot would have a clear view of that one distant window while out of sight of all the rest.",
"There were no villages.",
"I held my tongue.",
"She would then reply here, no doubt.",
"Throughout the long night I called many times at the hospital, but the reply was always the same.",
"He had made his little country wealthy.",
"Of course he would not have these advantages to recommend him.",
"I could find no words worth saying to him in reply.",
"The difficulty here of carrying out military operations according to a time table arranged several days in advance was very great.",
"It was the silence that comes over all places where there should be people, and yet where no one comes.",
"I drew myself up to my full height.",
"He drew himself up to his full height.",
"I do not think he expected her reply any more than I did.",
"It was he from whom speech might least be expected who first found his tongue.",
"She was well but quietly dressed, and her clothing showed no signs of violence.",
"To me these things are of slight consequence.",
"From that moment he had little to complain of in the attitude of the community as a whole.",
"There was silence for a moment after he had gone.",
"She found slight difficulty in carrying out this portion of the stage directions.",
"There was silence for a little while.",
"The price has been arranged, I think?",
"These advantages greatly impressed the people.",
"A similar force was arranged on the left of the second line for the same purpose.",
"Look again at the wars of the world.",
"And not in silence merely.",
"The wild rocks are round him, the clear sky is over him, and nothing more.",
"They made mistakes, and often worse than mistakes, for they were but men.",
"We must become good before we can make them good, and wise before we can make them wise.",
"I do not say that such words are wise.",
"The great proportion of this piece is surely in the very highest style of poetry.",
"It might make one in love with death to think that one should be buried in so sweet a place.",
"Kiss me, so long but as a kiss may live!",
"The chief city is placed at the end of a beautiful valley, formed by the highest mountain in the world, which is in the middle of the island.",
"The boy did not reply to this.",
"She drew back.",
"It was the old protest and the old reply.",
"Still no reply.",
"The fellow drew back and half turned, as if to escape.",
"For a moment there was no reply.",
"For what is wise?",
"Mention nothing of poetry.",
"I have been preparing for the occasion.",
"Are men all tongue and ear?",
"The air was cool and clear, and the sky was bright.",
"The physical expression is only a temporary condition.",
"I guess it was a delayed reaction.",
"It was not much of a weapon, but it would have to do.",
"There have been volumes of books written about me!",
"He was looking as much into the sun as into the face of the speaker.",
"He had never really lived in the usual sense of the word, but he was wise beyond his years.",
"A revolution of the worst type was in progress.",
"He was entirely a man of work and entered the legal profession, after he had completed his studies with great distinction, for the purpose of supporting himself by it.",
"In her case this public profession was a very real act.",
"Space does not permit any detailed account of her poetry.",
"I was not in a condition to climb up to the windows, neither could I get to the garden door.",
"So they quietly got on board.",
"In the hope that it might possibly have been delayed in starting, and that they might catch it, they at once started down the river in boats.",
"This determination was a wise one.",
"There is nothing in the world so charming as going to a play.",
"He looked quietly down into her face without moving a muscle in response to her change of humor.",
"There was a short silence.",
"In his generation the poor man thinks himself wise.",
"But wise people thought differently.",
"They walked on in silence for a few moments.",
"She drew them in and held them with her teeth.",
"In such wise the conversation went on during the dinner, which was a long one.",
"I do not complain.",
"He did not answer her question, and somehow she seemed to expect no reply.",
"There was a long silence.",
"The closed door heard the reply.",
"The man made no reply.",
"But there was no reply.",
"There was a suggestion of spring in the air.",
"For nearly half an hour they drove in silence.",
"He could not help wondering what thoughts there were behind her silence.",
"They did not speak for some time, and then it was the girl who broke the silence.",
"Then came a silence.",
"There was a moment of silence, for the implications of the last sentence were not as plain as they might have been.",
"We are all influenced by the past.",
"Within this limit alone can the highest order of true poetry exist.",
"He insisted that the money found through his means should be employed in his service.",
"He even pointed out the fact that there was no provision, nor means of making a camp.",
"Put it into a deep dish, and set it by for a day.",
"Repeat this till the dish is quite full.",
"The guests should be asked which of these they prefer.",
"This may be served in the dish, or turned out.",
"Serve in a hot covered dish.",
"This makes an excellent dish, and must be served very hot.",
"It should be served in rather a deep dish.",
"When they are done, put them on a dish, which keep hot before the fire.",
"This should be served in a silver dish, if at hand.",
"It is a fruit from which many dishes might be made.",
"It should turn out on the dish without any difficulty.",
"They should rise so much as to be almost like balls.",
"This dish is served cold.",
"Spread it carefully on the dish prepared for it, and serve at once.",
"This should be sent to table in a glass dish.",
"It makes a very nice breakfast dish.",
"All this done, she may settle herself down to any work on which she is engaged.",
"This will prevent the tongue from being injured.",
"It was a slight one, however, and he would not allow it to be attended to till the action was over.",
"Yes, the body was carried up there, and buried out of sight as quickly as possible.",
"Everybody does write poetry that goes there.",
"It was my first trouble, and I had to bear it in silence and alone.",
"Who is to settle what is a truly great work or a truly good man.",
"Here he recommended some one for a place, there he picked up a book or a set of books for some distant library.",
"He hated to see his mother worried.",
"Early next morning brother and sister started towards the valley.",
"After that the choice where to settle was left to them.",
"When she saw the sick man, she was completely overcome by memories of former times.",
"He sat down and buried his face in his hands.",
"His own mother actually telling him to write some poetry.",
"The old man would not go home with his son, but insisted on remaining until the paper was up.",
"Rich were preparing to open it when the fire occurred.",
"He apparently took command of the excited guests and issued orders like a general on the field of battle.",
"He was on a mission of peace and good will to the red men of the distant forest.",
"I had him buried, and all the rest I could find.",
"The villages have each a tale of loss to tell.",
"Once we were in safety, I hated it.",
"Then fell silence, and we knew that was all.",
"To this no reply was made by our side.",
"So they lay hidden a long time, until the sun stood high in the sky.",
"At this name a sudden silence fell.",
"The plan was soon arranged.",
"All at once he stopped, as on the previous night, being overcome by a sudden sense of silence.",
"His protest was, however, only formal and made to be overcome.",
"They tried to prevent me going, but I insisted.",
"Find the weapon for me, and I shall make the opportunity!",
"Still silence there!",
"But I did not know the way, and I could not even guide myself by the light in the sky, for I was running away from it.",
"But now that the spell of silence was broken the sounds came thick and fast.",
"On the second last evening of my stay I came back somewhat later than I had arranged, but found that my host was late too.",
"The silence was broken by only one sound, that of a man with a deep voice.",
"Unfortunately, the data are very slight.",
"The bond of union between these nations was slight.",
"In almost all wars there is something to be said on both sides of the question.",
"Good wars are fought by nations who make their choice, and would rather die than lose what they are fighting for.",
"The force is composed of men very various in rank and profession.",
"But memory fails on my mind.",
"He was wise enough to see he had made a false move and had lost ground in her regard.",
"He raised his hat as she drew near.",
"Is it wise?",
"I hoped for a moment that this change in the action of the force would settle a problem we had never been able to determine.",
"I meant to be found out and accept the consequences in silence.",
"On this she insisted much more than seemed just or reasonable.",
"A reply?",
"One of many such expressions will be sufficient to quote here.",
"Anyone who saw our soldiers under these conditions and heard their jokes will never forget the sight.",
"Every attempt to advance fails.",
"A terrible fit of anger was beginning to loose its hold upon him.",
"He wanted to be where, at the first indication of a stop, he could jump off the train.",
"I know they mean to destroy.",
"But the amount was small and would require only slight time.",
"It was a wise move, and if anything could do so it would save the day.",
"A strange silence had settled down over the farm.",
"The valley was a place of yellow light.",
"And then followed a silence.",
"He buried his face in his hands.",
"The boys complain of the mail service.",
"And I think if the ocean is not like the human heart, then what is it like?",
"He did not need to climb!",
"The slow climb there had proved to her how much she needed rest.",
"Nevertheless, equally impossible was it not to be influenced by their practical minds.",
"Being announced in this way, the other guests do not wait for an introduction.",
"And we complain that the day is too short!",
"Nobody seemed ready to reply.",
"That will settle the whole matter.",
"Such an assumption would involve but slight danger of discovery.",
"We could hold them here for a time at least, yet I had the sense to know that this check would prove only temporary.",
"I wondered what could be the meaning of that silence below.",
"The silence was finally broken by one of the men forward asking a question.",
"We seemed to be completely shut in between sea and sky, lost and forgotten.",
"What a story of the sea it might tell if it had a tongue.",
"This is no laughing matter, boys.",
"But the climb to the fallen man was another matter.",
"He was thinking only of their guests, whom he could not quite consider his own.",
"King held his silence.",
"By the end of the week her guests began taking their leaves.",
"He had promised to show her his latest temporary camp.",
"And would it take long to climb them?",
"He placed a chair for her and arranged for her room.",
"He drew close and stood, watching.",
"But only in anger this time.",
"He even drew closer while he spoke.",
"Their first hour after lunch led them through a region which, given over to silence itself, denied them any considerable opportunity for conversation.",
"How she hated him for that.",
"Nor did she fail to recognize that he had grounds for anger.",
"He looked up into the sky and not at her.",
"How she hated to touch it!",
"Deep silence answered him.",
"Even so, the climb was hard and slow, and more than ever before filled with danger.",
"Now he finished in silence.",
"She drew back from him.",
"I do not object to these titles in themselves.",
"He gave what are really excellent titles, but he does not tell us that they are his own!",
"An edition arranged on this principle could not possibly be acceptable to more than a few persons.",
"A silence fell on the room.",
"Then they went quietly in, and finding the kitchen door open, went in.",
"Let the women settle it among themselves.",
"So when I went to his home I said little about our valley, except to tell them of the beauty of it.",
"He would give the child a dollar for a kiss, but if he did not come running to him the very moment he called he would be angry.",
"Did she attract trouble by some quality of heart or brain.",
"They had too many ways of controlling the vote.",
"But what was that distant cry that sounded from the wood in the direction in which her brothers had gone?",
"Strong, laughing.",
"Men were standing about talking and laughing, others working hard.",
"But I sat quietly, even when he went up and turned her over with his foot to see if she was really dead.",
"He lay quietly, even when she left him and went to another counter.",
"I went quietly to it and looked in.",
"He turned around, and though it was not a very bright night, there was light enough for me to see the ugly face of my old master.",
"We found ourselves in a large room, with a platform at one end of it.",
"I would never distinguish myself in any profession.",
"I wish the government would take up this matter of making roads and settle it.",
"The men were talking and laughing, and there was no sign of strange animals, so I went around to the back of the yard.",
"I have buried him.",
"The girl drew her face back a little.",
"He tells one quietly.",
"Just then a slight sound behind him brought him to his feet.",
"The rest watched them in silence.",
"It seems an ugly place to get up.",
"The exact formula is as yet far beyond our reach.",
"The animal fails to grow.",
"Then they figured out their position, which was not hard to do, since the sky was clear and the sun well up.",
"No good, no wise man can like actions drawn from such principles.",
"In the tongue of the wise is health.",
"The poor dog was laughing.",
"He that knows not how to hold his tongue knows not how to talk.",
"Yet why complain?",
"The champion received them with due respect and honor.",
"One thing sure, it must be pretty bad to be out on the ocean like that in a little boat and be almost dead.",
"Now at last I knew for sure that I hated that fellow.",
"But most of the time I could look down and see the valley and the water in the bottom of it, just like a river.",
"Her mother was really wealthy, and she was an only child.",
"But the silence shut down again after that.",
"Had not we not a most charming evening?",
"Am I loved, or am I hated?",
"It is natural perhaps, at the conclusion of such a narrative as this, to represent them all as happy.",
"The father is a retired lawyer, and wealthy.",
"It is never wise to take too much for granted.",
"Then there came to the spot a presence that could not be treated with anger.",
"She had observed that her mother urged her own guests to stay, and sometimes kept them almost by force.",
"Just now she saw the face of her dear husband, who had long ago been buried out of her sight.",
"The man and the woman looked down together, in silence, at the child.",
"He moved away to the window, as though searching for air.",
"There fell a silence.",
"No one made reply.",
"Quietly, now.",
"Her head was turning, yes, she would see her and then she could not know about dates or have a lesson in reading poetry!",
"It had brought her peace of mind that was worth more hard promises than she could think of making.",
"He had no reply at hand.",
"But it was a silence that she felt she might break at any moment.",
"In a few brief sentences, sentences in which each word told, she gave him the story of her dark year.",
"Still there was silence.",
"In this wise.",
"They will find reasons, and make reasons to prove, if need be, that there is no sun in the sky.",
"But what may we learn from this ugly story?",
"It was a long narrative.",
"A little silence followed.",
"Again the silence.",
"He turned down the valley.",
"He had reached the bottom of the narrow valley.",
"Once his back was turned it seemed that the slide gained speed.",
"But, after all, it was beginning to occur to him that it might not be wise to kill the man in the presence of other people.",
"The cost and importance of it made his eyes like steel and drew his mouth to a thin, straight line.",
"He drew a little closer.",
"But the position was the most hated one.",
"What one of us has not buried in him a story quite as strange?",
"He drew it closer before sitting down.",
"And I was wise enough not to let him get away with anything unless I sat in on the deal.",
"He fell right on his ugly little nose and broke it!",
"For some time I remained of that opinion, and I made a statement to that effect in a leading literary journal.",
"She had begun to laugh again, while giving him many a kiss in return for his own.",
"The regulations required perfect silence there during work.",
"Otherwise social revolution lies at the end of the road.",
"And she had entered the room convinced that she looked charming!",
"One could not even see the children now in order to kiss them.",
"Deep silence fell.",
"The silence fell again.",
"Then she spent months and months in consulting one and another.",
"There was a long spell of silence.",
"Silence fell between them.",
"As a rule he came to kiss her.",
"Silence fell.",
"They do not live under the sky, they avoid the light.",
"It is these that have to be altered if we are to avoid future wars on a scale as great.",
"These are generally the vehicle for moral lessons which are all the more impressive because not insisted on.",
"Should I destroy them both?",
"We will not reply.",
"Silence there.",
"There was no wonder at all that wise people should wish to get out of such a place in such hot weather.",
"Not one of the real leaders of the revolution was arrested.",
"His promises were enough.",
"The revolution had begun.",
"It is not difficult to be wise after the event.",
"If it is, what is the cause of the revolution?",
"Thus the strong promises international justice to the weak.",
"Her loss has created almost a revolution in ocean traffic.",
"Ocean has still a strength beyond ours.",
"I do not fear revolution.",
"The advantages, however, are not all on the side of the government.",
"They had lived together like brothers, and like brothers, they had fallen into the habit of closing the door of silence upon certain subjects.",
"It is all arranged.",
"But there was no reply to this plain question.",
"For a moment they sat in silence.",
"He was perhaps wise in his generation.",
"Many from the valley came to make inquiry.",
"She hated him.",
"They were fighting at the mouth of the valley.",
"A moment later she heard him laughing and talking in the library.",
"The valley seemed quiet enough.",
"The very excess of the provision beyond the needs, takes away all sense of proportion between the end and means.",
"I love to taste them, as it were, upon the tongue of my friend.",
"Editors find their own jokes, or do as well without them.",
"We sometimes wonder from what sky they fall.",
"This bridge is a mile and a quarter in length, and is ugly enough.",
"It will automatically develop roots.",
"Started preparing my written report.",
"Still, speaking at a competition was one thing and being the main speaker for the day was quite another.",
"But it cannot, I am afraid, be said, that as we are grown wise, we are made happy.",
"Who would not try the experiment, which promises advantage without expense?",
"Why have no complaints been made by those that have been injured?",
"Why have they not at last been shown the use of those weapons which they have so long carried, and the advantages of that exercise which they have been taught to perform with so much address?",
"Why should he complain?",
"Nor, in the present instance, have I reason to complain.",
"Apparently without suggestion from me he had taken me for his own to tend and watch over.",
"One must be wise, for either will release important cards.",
"That seemed to settle the matter definitely.",
"But who had arranged everything?",
"One day she walked over to the farm and made her way quietly to the back door.",
"Again a silence fell upon the group.",
"But though awareness of being is the necessary foundation for any further possibilities it is, so to say, not much to talk about.",
"The answer is that we cannot accept any suggestion unless we believe it to be true, and to believe it to be true we must feel that we have a solid foundation for our belief.",
"To get rid of these we require a firm basis on which to receive the opposite suggestion.",
"The country, too, was of such a character that knowledge of war in other campaigns was of little value.",
"For a few moments none broke the silence.",
"A long silence followed.",
"He is long in getting at the interest of his narrative.",
"If she be pleased, I have no right to complain.",
"Books are, in a great measure, the instruments of controlling the opinions of a nation like ours.",
"If he would tell him where a letter would find him in the morning, he would send a reply to the one he had received.",
"The speaker entered.",
"He aimed not at his life, but at his own escape.",
"But as I do not see how to carry out such a plan, I have no right to complain of others for not seeing.",
"He forgot the subject in the speaker.",
"A distant shot in the cover.",
"She did not answer him, but kept her face buried in her hands.",
"A dead silence followed.",
"Not so very ugly?",
"I have sent a reply to the writer.",
"That is just a possibility but a remote one, for the committee will certainly make due provision for those who may suddenly find themselves out of employment.",
"I want no revolution.",
"There was no anger in me, I told him this home truth because I loved him.",
"Then I come to the members of the profession which one time I used to carry on.",
"Anger will serve no purpose.",
"What I have said is that they are a distant goal.",
"It would be a long time before word could get back to the capital of what I had done in those distant regions.",
"Then would begin a grand system of reforms and national progress.",
"She had never before been able to overcome the force of her natural fears.",
"It is a charming walk, mostly over the fields.",
"This I hope has been the case, for we had not been many days, I may say hours, in the town, before we were fully convinced it was the place for us to settle in.",
"They came in a van with horses to spend the day.",
"He was first to break the silence.",
"An interview was arranged for the next evening.",
"We read poetry.",
"Please reply.",
"Then she turned upon him almost in anger.",
"She drew herself up.",
"There was a brief silence.",
"For a moment he held her quite quietly.",
"We all make mistakes, of course.",
"She made him sit down and drew a low chair herself to his side.",
"Then there was silence.",
"He passed his arm around her and drew her from the window.",
"When he came back, he drew me aside.",
"The fellow did not reply at once.",
"Then she walked quietly out of the room.",
"The girl gave him a searching look.",
"She kept a tight tongue.",
"I can keep my tongue as still as anybody when I like.",
"He let things slide for the moment.",
"Straight down this valley?",
"He wanted to be with his thoughts, his horse and silence.",
"He took his time to reply.",
"There was another little period of silence between them.",
"Still he fails to turn aside her thoughts.",
"We must not therefore suppose, however, that the cause of religious poetry has been a losing one.",
"Cannot the hand destroy him that made all?",
"Surely there is poetry as well as truth in this.",
"But, certainly in general, his thought is far in excess of his poetry.",
"My hands hang quietly at my side.",
"From a sudden illness, he died and was buried here.",
"He has not even the rights of a foreign resident.",
"A silence followed.",
"In this tone and attitude he continued his narrative for a few minutes.",
"I now began to find meaning in the things, which I had read or heard about the importance of poetry and art as instruments of human culture.",
"She broke the silence again.",
"If so, is it wise to risk his life in this fashion?",
"There was an intense silence.",
"A silence fell.",
"He did not answer, and she looked at him as if waiting for his reply.",
"She drew away from him.",
"And when the sun was gone down he went and buried him.",
"Ask and demand counsel of a wise man.",
"And so he did and drew him out of the water to the dry land.",
"Go back, go back, and be wise.",
"In this light, therefore, he came to the end of the valley.",
"So they turned away from the man, and he, laughing at them, went his way.",
"He was an aged man.",
"On the day when her mother was buried she received the red shoes and wore them for the first time.",
"It had quite a charming appearance, but the old lady could not see well, and therefore took no pleasure in it.",
"But he thought no more of me, and had he seen me, he would certainly have never recognized me, so ugly as I am now.",
"She drew one out.",
"He had made remarkable promises.",
"They selected these as a temporary prison.",
"The air was cold, the sky was gray.",
"This drew the others after them.",
"When the first vehicle was full, a second, of a similar construction drew up.",
"They drew up an official report.",
"They hated each other.",
"One cannot pass it over in silence.",
"The anger was coming slowly, but it was coming.",
"He drew me into a dark street.",
"I drew near.",
"We went away in silence.",
"The street was quite dark, nothing could be seen of the sky.",
"This time the silence was not broken.",
"The officer made no reply.",
"Do not complain of being here.",
"The people drew back.",
"Nevertheless here is a fact which we believe we ought not to pass by in silence.",
"How should it be overcome?",
"The train had stopped in the middle of a charming landscape.",
"The river wound through a valley, which appeared like a huge garden.",
"What can be done against a revolution which has so much right on its side?",
"The affair was arranged in this way.",
"But it drives them also occasionally to run away, and sometimes to destroy themselves.",
"He closed his book and placed it on the table at his side and buried his face in his hands.",
"Overcome with the sad picture he had created in his mind, he buried his face again in his hands.",
"The ship was delayed a little.",
"It did, and when they reached the valley she was quite herself again.",
"I, and anger too.",
"His tongue had bin enough.",
"Is that a wise word?",
"At worst none can be lost but this slight fellow.",
"The smoking habit affects different men in different ways.",
"But there is a sudden, slight noise behind.",
"And it was but because of what I have told that I had them buried as they were.",
"They spent a charming day and evening together, and he was content.",
"In her hat this time was a touch of the sky when it lies over a great lake.",
"A wild idea of trying to climb the post with the baby came into his head.",
"Drink, no doubt, has its advantages to those who do not drink.",
"She was beautiful in person as she was charming in manner.",
"This knowledge of the world, seen as I saw it, was of the greatest use in my profession.",
"He arranged me well.",
"Only the wealthy could be members of this club, for only the wealthy could lose money and pay it.",
"Time, however, fails.",
"Then I made my first wise business move.",
"He could see nothing, and could hear only the sound of distant talking.",
"Overcome evil with good.",
"She insisted on hearing all the details of his experience since the evening he had saved her from disaster during the wind storm.",
"One might as well be buried alive, and be done with it.",
"So he made up his mind at once, and in due time the marriage was arranged.",
"He put his arm around her and drew her close.",
"There was a silence when she finished, among the children as well as among the grown persons present.",
"It was all arranged that she should come here.",
"He might need the weapon now more than ever.",
"These were the people whose attention he had tried to attract back there in the road.",
"She seemed to regard him in slight surprise.",
"Then, silence.",
"This tower is about a mile distant from the foot of the lowest fall.",
"A pleasant climb.",
"A fine but difficult climb.",
"No wonder she hated him for what he had done to her.",
"Usually half a dozen guests were present at these services in addition to his immediate household.",
"She was still laughing at him.",
"Silence became too significant.",
"If she liked a piece of poetry, she could learn it by reading it over a few times.",
"He aimed carefully and fired.",
"A very considerable increase was arranged.",
"I was glad to be alone, for as I had said, I wanted to think quietly.",
"We drove on for some minutes in silence.",

"Passing over all political questions, however, our narrative calls us to the relation of its closing scene.",
"When she had read it she drew out her watch.",

"I will put my journal there.",

"Nothing is known of him as a resident in this city.",
"My memory never fails.",
"Now let us settle our plan of campaign.",
"The chief made no reply.",
"Of course, I knew what that meant, and I drew my own conclusions.",
"It was never answered or acknowledged, and he did not act upon the suggestion or discuss acting upon it, to my knowledge, with any of his colleagues.",
"He would then have had the confidence and support of all the smaller nations because they would have looked up to him as their champion and guide.",

"But it was just as the wise ear said it would be.",

"It is buried.",
"The silence which followed this awful speech could be felt.",
"It is also his highest weapon.",
"He sat down, and there was a long silence.",
"Yes, I would tell him, and in a few sentences I told.",
"A grown man and a member of a serious profession, too!",
"We had passed through into the next room before either of us broke the silence.",
"And now as to the conclusions which I drew from these facts.",
"He established the earth and sky.",
"His conversation is said to have been charming, and even fascinating.",
"But his narrative is always interesting, and his language pure.",
"Style is to written composition what delivery is to a public speaker.",
"I hope to treat it more at length in subsequent volumes.",

"What personal means of controlling the public the minister has at his command!",
"In his own notes we have found several mistakes.",
"Business men, though they were convinced that the telephone would carry spoken messages, nevertheless insisted that it presented no business possibilities.",
"There was, of course, no provision for communication between cities.",
"Nor was it long delayed.",
"It was done in this wise.",
"Passing from private houses, the meetings were held in a school house, but in course of time the school house became too small, and a larger one was built, with a special view to a provision for religious meetings.",
"I saw clearly that some other provision must be made.",
"But the speaker was lost to everything except his theme.",
"But the other reply is more to the point.",
"He did so, and his anger began to cool.",
"Silence answered.",
"Her son ate rapidly in silence.",
"But this narrative is concerned only with the facts in the case.",
"It is much easier to get information in small villages than in cities.",
"We drew off to one side and stopped the machine to let her pass.",

"He had not a word to reply.",
"He resolved to overcome whatever opposed itself to him.",
"There is a dead silence.",
"She spoke in little sentences.",
"My own marriage was arranged for this end.",
"He makes no reply.",
"The citizens and soldiers had mostly left the walls, and the few who remained were overcome with sleep.",
"But even this deep insight into the existing state of things, which revealed the whole extent of the evil, showed him also the means by which it might be overcome.",
"When all other email fails.",
"After a time he broke silence.",
"It is common, with slight variations, to different languages.",
"She looked up at him a while in silence.",
"It is very charming.",
"Let me see if I can reduce it to narrative.",
"Something in the picture always drew and held my attention.",
"Death was a thing to be hated.",
"The very silence has another quality than the silence of the day.",
"The dead officer lay on his face in a pool of blood, the weapon still in his breast.",
"This narrative begins with the death of its hero.",
"They moved slowly and in silence.",
"And there was danger for the unknown cities of the distant plain.",
"A dead silence of some minutes.",
"Partly also it was due to a touch of poetry.",
"He caught her hand, but she drew back.",
"I have arranged them in order.",
"That was her reply.",
"He was kind to them, it is true, but at times very severe, and they could neither reply to him nor leave him.",
"Being alive, I want to see, and all the world is a bigger thing to see than one small town or valley.",
"The dishes had not moved upon the table.",
"Lie out there quietly on the board.",
"And so it was, according to the narrative as given, that he wrote the pages of his book.",
"The open ocean lay before me.",
"It was a wealthy magazine.",
"Remember my chains.",
"And as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.",
"The rich man also died and was buried.",
"Then he went around the villages teaching.",
"But rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.",
"He was very wise.",
"She is wise, too wise ever to command me to speak this secret.",
"His face was black with anger.",
"My tongue was like that, too.",
"At last he broke silence.",
"And what could I reply?",
"But a king must be fed, and it is not good to anger a king.",
"I used to have a charming little circle at home, but now I meet no one I know.",
"A warm, still morning, with a clear sky and stars.",
"Now it is charged with messages from the ocean.",
"If we are perfectly honest with ourselves we shall not find it difficult to settle whether we ought to do this or that particular thing, and we may be content.",
"These are the poetry of nature.",
"Poetry, if it is to be good for anything, must help us to live.",
"It is very big, very rich, and perfectly ugly.",
"It is not the purpose of this narrative to answer that question.",
"There was a woman on the platform seeing him off.",
"For instance, I have never been in a revolution yet.",
"And there is not an ugly person nor an ugly scene in it.",
"I have passed hours with him when he was so wise, good, and sweet, that I never knew the like of it in any other.",
"These are what I mean by poetry and nature.",
"In short, I held my tongue.",
"People complain that I never give news in my letters.",
"The balls are rather hard, but very light and quite round.",
"Please reply on this by return.",
"Here I am until I die, and here will I be buried.",
"And no doubt it requires some decision to break so long a silence.",
"Plate, dish.",
"To kiss.",
"A kiss.",
"To lose, destroy, to hang.",
"The true way to be a wise man is to hear, see, and bear in mind.",
"As I drew near she looked up.",
"When we come out in the summer we should be like people dropped from the sky.",
"Power to destroy?",
"The rain has delayed their work.",
"These villages are full of shops."],

["On the conclusion of the ceremony, they returned in the same manner in which they had come.",
"As I did so, I observed that they had not burned away, but had been put out.",
"The others had disappeared.",
"Thus, after a great while, it disappeared.",
"This disappeared, and I saw that nothing was altered in any way.",
"It is many weeks, since I came back from that strange and terrible journey through space and time.",
"And so a time passes.",
"Usually, it was evening before he made the return journey.",
"However, a sufficient amount was found in the country, and he was able to make his journey.",
"The opening ceremony was very brilliant.",
"Sky and sea or desert may be about him.",
"It is rule over the pride of man.",
"Let him dream of great themes, and work for great things!",
"Of my journey home, little remains to be said.",
"This has been proven to us by many facts.",
"He was to have paid us a visit of some weeks, and we had expected his arrival next day.",
"How did she pass out from her room, leaving the door locked on the inside?",
"What had I accomplished?",
"There was a moment of confusion.",
"Someone suggested drinks.",
"He with his teeth, and I with my knife, settled the matter in less than a minute.",
"I took a seat and regarded the persons who were standing and sitting about the room.",
"I am getting out of my depth.",
"He started again when I said this, and going across the room, locked the door and put the key in his pocket.",
"It disappeared at once.",
"Time passes quickly.",
"He was able, however, to retain his business.",
"Was she capable of any depth of feeling?",

"Some of the people were crying.",
"The houses had been burned.",
"It was a terrible journey.",
"His first address was not very promising.",
"Passes to every show in town.",
"The house was in the process of painting, too, still wet under a first wash of gray.",
"Under the old system of playing the tie off in the city where the tie game is played, it brings about a great deal of confusion.",
"It is her pride, he told himself.",
"I went to the top room and locked the door.",
"He suddenly disappeared, no one knowing where he had gone or why he had come among us.",
"I did not discover any, however, although I saw plenty of tracks in the snow.",

"These articles were all gathered up and burned.",
"One evening I was called upon to perform a marriage ceremony.",
"Such an account he gave me of his journey!",
"Another journey in the dark!",
"The long journey had been a great strain upon her strength and she was very tired.",
"But her eyes looked as if she had been crying.",
"God gives in a royal way.",
"He took a letter from his pocket and held it toward her.",
"How blind she had been!",
"She and her cousin were alone.",
"And to break the journey may make a big difference.",
"This boy seemed promising.",
"She even stopped crying.",
"Every hour in the greater world outside, someone, somewhere, is starting out upon this journey.",
"Without dogs that journey was impossible.",
"Why did he go on lying about his journey like that to an expert?",
"He took another of the same description out of another pocket.",
"Imagination all!",
"Bird was laid away, but the children requested his presence.",
"There should be plenty of time for the children to learn to wash and dress themselves.",
"The development of industries.",
"What depth of snow there was I cannot say.",
"What the character of this rock is I could not observe, as I saw it only from the river, which is about a quarter of a mile distant.",
"I called on a publisher last week about it.",
"Another month passes on.",
"He was the first to make the journey, and none have followed him.",
"I do not know, but I am confident that but a little way west we should come to water.",
"What happened next is all confusion in my mind.",
"I was crying like a child.",
"How could I help crying?",
"And this afternoon she has seen her again, and sits there crying because she says the dear old lady looks so sad.",
"I thought I heard this door open, but it is locked.",
"It was my pride, because I have had my own way all my life.",
"I will not deny that I was disappointed beyond measure by this result.",
"He did not deny the fact.",
"By measuring we know what things are long, and what short.",
"To wash it let me home repair.",
"The money that comes in never equals what we pay out.",
"To this end a concrete example may be taken.",
"The colors fell in the struggling group in the center.",
"Indeed, I doubt whether he could stand so long a journey.",
"The journey was thrown away.",
"This is true of all classes of men, the employer as well as the employee.",
"On the other hand, a knife offered advantages almost too numerous to be listed.",
"Eventually, he took out his knife.",
"If the girl had been half blind she must have felt that here was a man of fire.",
"Therefore, it was really not strange to her that throughout the journey her guide did not speak half a dozen words to her.",
"It looked strange, that sudden flight of his, but then, he was a proven man.",
"And he went down the hill, making sure that he was fit for battle with knife and gun.",
"He had been a great and widely known figure on the mountain desert while she herself was no more than a girl.",
"Certainly there was nothing cold about the way he regarded it.",
"The door was locked.",
"I had been blind not to see it!",
"Illustrated magazines go everywhere in these days.",
"It is an offense to mention them so.",

"It was a hard journey.",
"He followed these tracks.",
"A former employer of his told me.",
"Which narrative is the more concrete?",
"Look, therefore, through the modern definitions.",
"I did as he requested me.",
"Although the night was warm and an electric light burned under the roof, nobody was about.",
"He would know where they pointed when the journey was over.",
"It is truly a royal plant.",
"The falling leaves, all over the forest, are protecting the roots of my plants.",
"I thought of the letter that was in my pocket.",
"This is usually regarded in the original creation of an army.",
"But in the use and management of the vital machines, the human bodies, by which the purposes of war are to be accomplished, nations are less wise.",
"My failure to reply has been due to a doubt in my own mind as to whether good would be accomplished by any letter which I could write.",
"The master of the house, his wife, and guest were nowhere to be seen.",
"I remember being told, and I suppose this to have been the true solution, that it was the sound of the waves, after a high wind, breaking on the long beaches many miles distant.",

"At the same moment he struck with his knife.",
"The waves washed over the spot where he had gone down.",
"The question of when the murder was committed was regarded as important.",
"But the return journey would be made in a somewhat different way.",
"Somebody was in the library and had dropped the blind.",
"They were shut, and the first one was locked.",
"Says they disappeared morning after murder when investigation was taking place.",
"The tube of it was warm.",
"The gas had been turned off that very morning and I had no matches in my pocket.",
"I did not know what to make of bottles on the kitchen table.",
"I want to clear my mind in reference to these bottles.",
"No common man such as we are looking for, would make choice of just those bottles.",
"Those bottles, full or empty, must be found.",
"He also perceived that some of these children loved her.",
"She was in the building, and I stood almost on a level with her, with a bottle in my pocket.",
"I cannot deny it.",
"Her door was shut and when I went to open it I found it locked.",
"I had the key and I locked it.",
"My arrival happened later.",

"A man went on a journey.",
"When all was quiet, the woman got up, took a knife, and killed her husband.",
"She dressed her own daughter and put her in the place of the blind one.",
"We had accomplished nothing of importance by going home.",
"Neither of us spoke when we were finally come to where we could have a fairly good view of the scene of confusion.",
"Then followed offense on offense.",
"The kitchen door was locked.",
"He went to a side door, to the front entrance, and found the whole house locked, and no key to be discovered.",
"I mention it simply in order to remind ourselves of the importance of dealing with it as soon as possible.",
"Here in this drama he has accomplished everything.",
"Time passes slowly, but surely.",
"The light was already coming in, just a little, through the blind, for it was summer.",
"Then out came his knife.",
"Before morning the water it left had all disappeared.",
"He regarded the end of life as being, in a large measure, just to take his share in the general business.",
"Other officers, who had got wind of his arrival, dropped in, and he told again the story of the meeting with the enemy.",
"These regulations produced some supplies, though very little when compared to our great needs.",
"We would save the general, or die defending him.",
"I followed her with my eyes, noting how strong and confident and beautiful she was.",
"And I promised all my substance to any one who would do this, and no one was found.",
"The speaker disappeared.",
"Burned me.",
"If ever wars are to be ended, the imagination of man must end them.",
"And my sons?",
"The same happened in other departments.",
"There is another point of economics on which there seems to be some confusion of mind.",
"The drivers used to try to keep to the tracks made by other cars.",
"The motor stops.",
"I felt the need of some ceremony, and I think others felt the need of it too.",
"It was locked and the key taken away.",
"Leaving him crying on the ground, they ran back to the camp.",
"The others now began to press forward, but were warned by the man with a knife not to come too near.",
"Was she aware that the woman who had fallen there had disappeared?",
"I went to put them back but discovered the door locked.",
"I think, however, he only told me this because he thought I would be more patient while he took his measurements and made his investigations.",
"She had actually disappeared!",
"My pocket was empty!",
"He posted them in a strong position in the rough pass, and attacked the enemy in places where it was impossible for him to make use of his strength.",
"But that policy was not to be accomplished by open and responsible acts.",
"Even as a general he gained by comparison with his rival.",
"At an early date he perceived that the new art would be of little value if there were not careful press readers.",
"It is a very safe quality, for the more he knows, the less likely is he to commit himself.",
"Who invented politics?",
"This little ceremony breaks the ice.",
"As to the state of the world after the war, he is very confident, provided we go on fighting long enough.",
"He did fine work more than once in creating order out of confusion.",
"From his conversation he might have been in a pot house.",
"She was watching me now with a cool, confident smile that made me turn away.",
"Why did he risk everything to bring out the paper when he might have burned it?",
"In the breast pocket of his coat.",
"I was forced to reduce our pace to a walk, but I was confident that it did not make much difference.",
"The blind was not drawn that night.",
"Here are a piece of string and a newspaper.",
"The idea was to upset stomach and brain till he was half crazy.",
"He had the implement in his pocket.",
"She pointed him out as a model to both of her sons.",
"The one here shown was her special pride.",
"In the city itself there were only old men, women, and children, so that there was no possibility of defending it.",
"There were yet some campaigns of his brief and bright career to be accomplished.",
"If I do, my pride will have a fall.",
"True, and here is another confusion.",
"Do we pride ourselves on being something?",
"Shall we pride ourselves on health and strength?",
"I deny both.",
"I asked her why she carried that in her pocket.",
"But in case I send it printed, it will be merely that mistakes may be avoided.",
"Nothing exists but as it is perceived.",
"And then in winter let him follow the same tracks if he can.",
"But the house was always under the royal protection.",
"As a matter of fact, however, she failed to understand her cousin.",
"This she believed would give her a powerful advantage over all competitors.",
"He opened a small door and disappeared.",
"But by some strange chance he had already turned a corner and disappeared.",
"At the office the manager met him on his arrival and called him into his private room.",
"One can imagine all sorts of horrible things on an empty stomach.",
"Then they followed and kept him in sight until he reached the entrance to the court and disappeared within.",
"I take a pride in it.",
"We went in to look at the royal fish.",
"The employer, who had promised, was himself disappointed of the expected work.",
"It has every spell ever invented in it!",
"This made the journey go much more quickly.",
"Gotta get her home now.",
"It was clear, then, that our only chance of success was by going round, instead of through, the desert.",
"It will throw additional light on the latter to go back and run the mind over the string of historical facts already stated.",
"Being left by her father alone for some days with this cousin, the influence of the visit was very powerful on her.",
"Of this I even now retain a distinct impression.",
"So did the sweet singer herself write from her own experience.",
"The sons were out in the field.",
"One said she appeared to herself like a blind person just beginning to see.",
"She was soon attacked by the same disease.",
"But he would not allow himself the luxury of being the first arrival.",
"It was her one pride, perhaps her one hope.",
"His hand went to the pocket in question, and produced exactly what she had suggested.",
"He had a little money in his pocket, but nothing to identify him.",
"That which passes in or out of such minds has its own standard of importance.",
"She was looking at him with a strange pride on her face.",
"She was half hidden behind her cousin.",
"But he also has his pride.",
"He may have reason to hate some employer, but why hate the job?",
"Hospital equipment was distributed, and school equipment, and supplies of every variety.",
"She said she did not remember she did, but said she appeared to be as much a substance as I did who talked with her.",
"Finding now that he did not come forward or go on speaking, the guests particularly regarded him.",
"Let it be carefully picked and put into the bottles, which must be clean and perfectly dry.",
"It is yet impossible to estimate either the present value or the remote issues of the work which he has accomplished.",
"The old bottles would not serve to hold the new wine, but this did not mean that new bottles were not to be sought.",
"She informed us that when she had spoken to her sons about their future plans, she had discovered that neither of them had ever spoken about it to the other.",
"Well, and what had he accomplished?",
"As soon as they saw her, they felt that they might each be special friends with their charming guest.",
"The door leading to the house was forced open and it was discovered that the fire had nearly burned through the floor.",
"We enter this war only where we are clearly forced into it because there are no other means of defending our rights.",
"A conflict was avoided with difficulty.",
"The enemy is in force not a mile away from them, and in a moment they may be attacked.",
"I soon reached what I regarded as a good shooting point.",
"Bring my friend another pot of the same.",
"Here the lady was called away to receive a guest.",
"The walls were lined with maps, some representing houses, some lots, some streets, some entire towns.",
"We are consumers, and not producers of works of art.",
"He is worth all my sons put together.",
"It is but one mode of struggling for power.",
"When they entered, she turned and shut the door and locked it.",
"The hat disappeared.",
"It will retain it for a long time.",
"After this each of them retained a considerable body of men with him at his home.",
"They were both promising men.",
"We cannot count on the popular imagination being equal to the task.",
"No great harm is done, just as no great harm is done by bad novels.",
"The sons of song are gone to rest.",
"Commit them to another?",
"The confident element was extremely small, and its numbers few.",
"Only the form was retained.",
"Its one window was well provided with a heavy blind.",
"We observe more ceremony in family life than others in the most formal public relations.",
"Suddenly the light disappeared.",
"The drinks are made, of course, at home.",
"But, as regarded our own position, the appearance was as opposite as their direction.",
"That I cannot deny.",
"He had worked hard all his life, there among those desert hills, and during the few years his father had allowed him for education.",
"This blind old man was his father.",
"Unless protection is given to us it will probably be burned and destroyed.",
"The dark figures disappeared behind them.",
"There he got out to search for fresh car tracks turning up to the right.",
"He could not help his importance or his pride.",
"His plan was to raise himself on one knee and fire as many double shots as possible.",
"Red burned out the white of his face.",
"How blind!",
"I had a gun in my pocket.",
"She was struggling with her own feelings.",
"Deny it.",
"And if she had any desire to deny him it was lost in the moment.",
"His eyes burned.",
"How isolated each one was, locked in his own trouble!",
"But he was as blind as if he had no eyes, and he had to feel his way to climb out.",
"Slowly the light burned out.",
"These days she seemed all imagination.",
"Those who belong to good families seem to pride themselves upon their dress and style.",
"Of course the journey seemed long.",
"Yet how, and through what means, could such rescue be accomplished?",
"I was not blind to its danger, and yet nothing else offered any solution.",
"See his knife lies there.",
"But I could only hope to retain him through self interest.",
"The sound was not repeated and I no longer retained any sense of direction to guide me.",
"Then slowly they assumed shape and substance.",
"His wife was, indeed, as she had been represented, a most lovely and most accomplished woman.",
"Every one of the managers and heads of departments said it would be great stuff.",
"Also he found bottles.",
"Never a moment of such blind wonder.",
"She locked the door and returned to him.",
"Was he a man without imagination as he seemed to be without fear?",
"He went with his eyes on the ground, seeking tracks of a horse.",
"Her fire, though low, still burned.",
"She was not measuring every word now.",
"He was so confident now.",
"Struggling with something on her back.",
"Can this be accomplished by every man?",
"This is the sense of the desert hills, that there is room enough and time enough.",
"But it had disappeared.",
"Maybe he was crying too, for all I know.",
"He was struggling to get himself in hand.",
"She knew she was struggling to say what was difficult for her to get into words.",
"She would live even in a hotel rather than desert her children.",
"His interview with the old doctor had been very encouraging.",
"Say, doctor, that girl can swing an election.",
"I wish I could get them all lined up and talk to them.",
"She threw aside her pride, and going to the phone, called the hotel where she knew he stayed.",
"This was retained.",
"So much for the journey.",
"Now for what happened to them after their arrival!",
"She had on a white dress, and I watched her till she disappeared in the stable.",
"The boy held her by a string tied around one of her legs.",
"If ever I hear a man in trouble and crying for help I go to him and see what he wants.",
"The next day there was a scene of great confusion.",
"The doors were left a little open to give him air, and were locked in that way.",
"Then he stopped in the snow and fell dead in his tracks.",
"The inside of the building had burned away, and nothing more could be gotten out.",
"He would not deny his faith.",
"In the lower they have all but disappeared.",
"But we have started upon the long journey and we shall get there.",
"On the whole, the sort of face one passes in the street as stupid and common.",
"One may observe the same process in the lower animals.",
"Quickly the woman passes on to the next plane of her existence.",
"He died of a cancer of the stomach.",
"The supplies will be safe, then.",
"The horses had not had a very hard pull up to this time, and were, therefore, in pretty fair condition to attempt the last quarter of the journey.",
"There are tracks all right.",
"I never like to attempt anything on an empty stomach.",
"She had already explained this several times to her cousin.",
"Give me the knife.",
"This man is blind.",
"Beyond imagination pure and bright!",
"The door was locked!",
"She had no idea how long she had been locked in the room, and she could not calculate how far off the morning might be.",
"Upon my word I think he is always very entertaining.",
"He says he is his rival.",
"In the mean time, every thing in the public room was in confusion and disorder.",
"There were books and supplies to be drawn for the new academic year.",
"A scene of confusion followed.",
"When he turned, this man restored from the sea had disappeared.",
"She said they were the only days in her life in which she accomplished anything.",
"She did it with her own old fingers and her own blind eyes.",
"I began to laugh as hard as I had been crying.",
"What would boys do without a breast pocket, I wonder.",
"He had been arguing within himself all day whether or not to destroy that letter in his pocket or to show it to her.",
"How that tiny box burned in his pocket!",
"How that innocent ring burned in his pocket!",
"The room was locked up, and the professor carried the key.",
"He also felt somewhat sick at the stomach.",
"That substance had the same human nature as we have.",
"It was a great desert.",
"But would it wash over the top?",
"He had not enough money in his pocket to buy a meal, but he was not thinking so far ahead.",
"The old man regarded him with a new and sudden interest.",
"Nothing I can say will convince him.",
"And what of his sons?",
"Then he disappeared.",
"Who will wash the dishes?",
"Outside the farm, vehicles were ever setting down fresh families with troops of children, whose sea of fair heads was always expanding.",
"And I no longer remember the first journey.",
"But we must remind ourselves of the main situation.",
"But it still makes its appeal to the romantic imagination.",
"I do not believe there is a man or woman able to understand the statement who will deny it.",
"It does not develop anything, for it stops action, and without action there is no development.",
"What, worse and worse stomach!",
"I do not mean to pocket up this wrong.",
"The next morning he had more of a struggle than ever to wash and dress her.",
"What pride this fellow must feel to have such a wife, and such children taking after him.",
"And has he not reason for his pride?",
"At last we arrived at the prison and were locked into separate cells.",
"In the confusion I felt it safe to sit up.",
"He may have been too confident.",
"All that was a great deal to have accomplished in one short week, but there was much more that would require their immediate attention.",
"Yet, on the whole, with surprisingly little conflict and confusion the change was made.",
"For it has simply disappeared.",
"The knowledge that this can be done in an emergency is a great comfort, but it should be equally well known that it does not improve the car to make all stops that way.",
"Nevertheless, there could be no rival for the leadership.",
"The dogs, too, enjoyed the arrival of spring.",
"Every other day or so a new train, with fresh supplies, arrived at the front.",
"Who is his employer?",
"We are in a new world, struggling under old laws.",
"There will be considerable confusion when the doors are opened and the people crowd out.",
"Where is it, in my pocket?",
"The man, nursing his horses for the long journey, drove at an easy pace.",
"I always know the date of their arrival.",
"Nothing can be more kind or encouraging than this procedure.",
"They have, however, a few very good native novels.",
"During our journey, I forget on which day of it, a particular spot in the forest, at some distance from the road, was pointed out to us as the scene of a true, but very romantic story.",
"By now I was quite familiar with the routes and did not need anyone to pick me up from the bus stops on arrival.",
"That it is obvious is easy to say, and easy to deny.",
"This was projected, and this was performed.",
"In claiming independence, we claim but little.",
"Debate on choosing a speaker.",
"And who will expect that those will defend their allies, who desert themselves?",
"For surely it was never denied to any man to defend himself with the same weapons with which he is attacked.",
"Half of this country is desert.",
"There is nothing very particular in this ceremony, except a great deal of reading.",
"We were besides in the depth of winter.",
"Capital or royal cities.",
"Regarding these royal cities, we sum up our observations.",
"He was then locked up in chains till the following morning.",
"Somebody said the life of a mere literary man could not be very entertaining.",
"Let her eat at dinner as she will, but not take a full stomach to bed.",
"He was pleased that I had made this journey merely to keep him company.",
"Then he drew his large silver watch from his pocket.",
"She might as well have used the avoided word.",
"Then he put his money in his pocket and turned away.",
"His fishing was all a blind.",
"Do not deny me this.",
"He disappeared by the passage through which he had entered.",
"Nature frequently more than supplies the advantages of training and experience, by her own gifts.",
"She had seen the day named for his visit pass without his arrival, and now, as it was too late to profit by the opportunity, he had come for the second time into her neighborhood.",
"They are still retained in the service.",
"But he sent me home to his capital city, and continued his journey without me.",
"Few men had greater need of protecting themselves against the advance of old age.",
"He did not know where they were going, or when this journey would end, or that it was a journey.",
"They usually hang one who tries to desert.",
"The next moment he saw the men struggling in the water.",
"At last she disappeared.",
"I have avoided even considering them before.",
"Again his imagination was at work.",
"Their fingers were locked for a moment together.",
"He could neither listen nor observe.",
"He stopped short in sudden confusion.",
"Then she disappeared.",
"Then he turned back into the room and locked himself in.",
"The walls were lined with books.",
"He disappeared into his room for a few minutes.",
"Some of his confidence seemed to desert him.",
"He set up the drinks again and again.",
"The rest of the journey was accomplished in silence.",
"From that moment I regarded her with different eyes.",
"He pulled a piece of paper from his pocket.",
"They were setting out on a much longer journey.",
"When he opened them, the boy had disappeared.",
"By the by, I observe that when his body was found there was nothing on it in the shape of papers or money.",
"That was all a blind.",
"It was locked!",
"The ceremony was performed in the kitchen after they had finished doing the breakfast dishes.",
"Her eyes burned back into its own.",
"Or found, how shall it guide me, being blind?",
"Must all go by desert?",
"And now we come upon a strange little well in the desert.",
"Mother sat in a chair, and I was hanging on her knee.",
"I watched my chance, and when no one noticed, I disappeared.",
"I turned with the curve in the road and disappeared.",
"Though an illness left me unable to continue my college course, my pride kept me from returning to my mother.",
"I knew he was no other than my employer.",
"I had not written her the day of my arrival, thinking I would surprise her.",
"I stopped struggling to run.",
"In addition to the influence which this characteristic in him had on me and others, we found all the opinions to which we attached most importance, constantly attacked on the ground of feeling.",
"Nothing could seem more promising.",
"I already regarded the methods of physical science as the proper models for political.",
"Whether he retained all these opinions to the end of life I know not.",
"In both these departments, I have acquired more from her teaching, than from all other sources taken together.",
"But it was not, on the whole, very encouraging to me.",
"I played with fire, and I have been burned.",
"The woman in the next bed was crying too.",
"It was a valuable one and my employer, thinking too highly of my services, made me a present of half the value.",
"She regarded him with some surprise.",
"It is indeed an encouraging sign.",
"She went down to the well and filled her pot with water and returned.",
"And he became blind.",
"Then they asked the men if the waters were all of a depth.",
"How the fire burned!",
"Where was the man capable of entertaining such a dream?",
"No incident occurred during the journey.",
"The people are attacked.",
"I half drew it out of my pocket.",
"Getting into debt leads one to commit crimes.",
"Her husband had disappeared.",
"There they were locked up and forgotten.",
"Disorder is beginning to show itself in the services.",
"We are fighting a blind battle!",
"He had a top in his pocket.",
"Suddenly it disappeared.",
"Nevertheless some still thought that they would not be attacked till the next morning.",
"They invented crimes.",
"They invented laws.",
"He avoided it so little that he sought it.",
"The direction of the eyes, too, should be regarded, for from this we may learn something.",
"Some persons deny that it is so.",
"If he were attacked he would defend himself.",
"God surely will not desert us.",
"The journey was made without incident.",
"Immediately all was confusion.",
"How is this to be accomplished?",
"But it was this chair that the aging woman loved.",
"The figure passes along the long bright space.",
"Their tracks were all about.",
"He looked down at his knee and foot.",
"There was good music and a little sweet singing, the lady being in that art, as in every other, well trained and accomplished.",
"He sent her to different banks to try and cash it, but it was not till she got to a local bank, where she was known, that this was accomplished.",
"But if it was a comfort to him or a source of pride, I did not see why I should take it away.",
"The next thing that impressed me was that there was not the least confusion in his evidence or in himself.",
"Why, blind my eyes!",
"Environment supplies our company.",
"He walked around the house to find all the windows closed and locked.",
"This was locked up and dark within.",
"I have my task accomplished!",
"Both their father and mother, however, have requested me not to do this.",
"I was a guest in the home of a minister of the place.",
"This was the sort of change which I had been taught to look for as the consequence of getting that religion for which I had been struggling so hard.",
"The change which had taken place in me, however it is to be regarded, was not without a decided influence on my whole future life.",
"The news of my arrival soon spread among those who had been expecting it, though I neither saw nor had any direct communication with any of those who were to be my passengers.",
"The noise and confusion was very great.",
"Needs must when an empty pocket drives.",
"The man put his hand in his pocket and counted out the money.",
"Then she, too, disappeared.",
"Was he struggling to release himself?",
"He had imagination.",
"She gave up struggling.",
"The only way to escape arrest was to commit murder.",
"Get over the idea that this land up here is a desert.",
"I learned to read and write at his knee.",
"Slowly he got to his feet and locked eyes with the other.",
"He must find her while it was still light enough to follow her tracks.",
"A bear might have attacked her.",
"His imagination was active.",
"There was no uncertainty as to the direction of the tracks in the snow.",
"His head disappeared.",
"There was the impression of a knee in the snow.",
"Moving slowly forward, he came to the end of the tracks that had been made in the snow.",
"She lived much of the time inside herself with her own imagination.",
"Give him a few more days and he would have as good vision as before he had gone blind.",
"Until that could be accomplished, he tried to see her as little as possible.",
"Without them, of course, nothing could have been accomplished.",
"The start was promising enough.",
"It never left my pocket.",
"But then, as I said, quite suddenly it was as if a sharp knife had been stuck into my heart and turned round and round.",
"He gave me a leather case, which he took from an inner breast pocket, saying the letters were in it.",
"But what good to deny what I had just said?",
"Ability is the one crying need of the hour.",
"It was a long and difficult journey, but the child was equal to the challenge.",
"She had already proven that.",
"She knew that it would be hard to convince anyone of her origin without some sort of proof.",
"Imagination is obviously active in both.",
"Now compare with this a passage in which imagination is really active.",
"No man can be taught how to exercise the power of imagination.",
"A man must be himself convinced if he is to convince others.",
"Unfortunately, we were disappointed of seeing the ceremony, as it was over before we arrived.",
"I was particularly struck with this at dinner, on the day after my arrival.",
"We have not much money, but enough for the expenses of a journey to a foreign land.",
"He accomplished the impossible!",
"For from blind fear of the unknown, science does certainly deliver man.",
"That we should have to develop it, I do not deny.",
"He regarded her.",
"When this work was finally accomplished, the grounds were indeed beautiful.",
"In a minute the women were crying.",
"He asked them what they were doing there, and if they had passes.",
"On his arrival there, a year ago, he led a gay life for a few days and then suddenly disappeared.",
"Royal saw and understood.",
"The thing that is well done, is done with the least noise and confusion.",
"That has been a journey, indeed.",
"In a short time they all disappeared in a body.",
"All this was done without confusion, and with so little noise as to prevent those without from understanding what was in progress.",
"A few minutes of confusion followed.",
"Observe, that it does not refer to mere population.",
"I could not make any of them public, though sometimes requested to do so.",
"All this sounds hard and rough, but, observe, it is not addressed to any individual, and of course does not refer to any reader of these pages.",
"My experience, however, has not been encouraging.",
"Cousin for this new edition of a favorite work.",
"The next morning, she had disappeared.",
"A little shower had fallen during the night.",
"I heard her crying.",
"Very soon their journey would be ended.",
"My religious beliefs are very much the same as they have always been.",
"But the greater wound was not to his pride.",
"She has no imagination herself, none at all.",
"He felt cool, confident, happy!",
"A great wave of protecting love went out to meet that vision.",
"He looked at the girl a moment in measuring silence and then pointed to a chair.",
"And people are so hard to convince.",
"No, not his brother, nor his cousin, but the man himself!",
"The man who first invented writing was, without doubt, the greatest man that ever lived.",
"Then he put the bills back into his pocket and started slowly for the door.",
"Somehow all at once the case began to break up and go all to pot.",
"He perceived that he had lived with his head stuck in the sand.",
"The truth is, I came to join my cousin here, and I find him dead.",
"And it has introduced into domestic as well as international affairs a new spirit of disorder.",
"They had stopped feeding and were lying down.",
"For this to be accomplished, all that is needed is greater facility of travel.",
"In this case the officer making the arrest is out of pocket just so much.",
"He had learned a lesson from his more experienced rival.",
"The horses were smoking at the door, and the doctor was just back from his long journey.",
"He had had his journey for nothing, then.",
"Everywhere were the same black burned rocks and deep orange sand.",
"Poor blind one!",
"There was much confusion.",
"After the first moment of surprise his employer recognized him.",
"He had been lying back in his chair, with his hands locked behind his head.",
"He closed the door behind him, locked it, and threw himself down upon the bed.",
"I shall not deny that.",
"It was to discuss and settle this question, therefore, that the jury remained locked up in their room through so many hours.",
"I have neither the desire nor the opportunity to set myself right in that matter, but I do wish and I have fully determined to wash my hands of the whole affair.",
"He thought of the letter in his pocket, and the desire grew strong within him to read it again.",
"He drew them from his pocket and counted them.",
"At one place he found a burned match.",
"The boy had not spoken since the journey began, nor had he opened his eyes.",
"Then began the journey home.",
"Well, we gotta stand up for our rights.",
"If it stops because there is now no need of it, then it is plain there is, and ever has been, an all powerful intelligence.",
"When he is particular in counting, he may be attacked.",
"I perceived a large company coming out from the house.",
"This every man who has a name must observe.",
"But such being the situation of the royal family, they were glad to encourage all who would be their friends.",
"We also looked at an appearance of lead, which seemed very promising.",
"He indeed occasionally attacked them.",
"Even such a little journey as that.",
"Even when the higher animals are at rest it is possible to observe some kind of motion in them.",
"At last it stops from the need of repair.",
"On the other hand, severe exercise should not be taken on an empty stomach.",
"After a short time it will be found that a part of the salt solution has passed through into the water, while a larger amount of water has passed into the tube and raised the height of the liquid within it.",
"The parts might even be cut or burned without pain.",
"And yet we are told that in vision the eye is affected by something which is as material as any substance we taste or smell.",
"Remove every bit of foreign substance.",
"Loud talking must, of course, be avoided.",
"If there is the least doubt about the substance, do not assume the least risk, but destroy it at once.",
"Note that it is placed well back, and that it forms no part of the knee joint, and takes no share in supporting the weight.",
"A tube or passage.",
"A narrow tube.",
"The perception of an external impression by the nervous system.",
"Deny it not.",
"To leave her now were to deny her.",
"It is not the people that are in fault for not being convinced, but he that cannot convince them.",
"Nature makes us blind where we should be injured by seeing.",
"A little boy dressed up very fine, who puts his finger in his mouth and takes to crying, if other boys make fun of him, looks very silly.",
"But now observe this.",
"After that, he carefully avoided weapons.",
"How she is crying!",
"There was a pot on the fire, and they took the meat out and put it on a plate, and told me to eat only the meat that came off the head.",
"They saw the small hand come out of the earth, and the little child take from it the knife.",
"He now does nothing but talk of the ceremony, but not indeed of the day.",
"I should have very little to say against a man, of whose actions I am not to set up myself as a judge, did he not address my cousin.",
"This letter, it seems, she has put in her pocket.",
"A stomach disorder!",
"The person, it seems, was curious to know the day that the ceremony was performed.",
"See her confusion!",
"For he was not crying in the usual way with little boys.",
"At last she reached the end of the wall and disappeared around the corner.",
"The walls were lined with them.",
"First it was decided to wash the floor.",
"They simply disappeared one day, and those who stayed behind forgot them until next season.",
"What a singer he was!",
"It took some little time to do this, but it was finally accomplished.",
"The girls were now getting so wet that they decided not to stand on ceremony.",
"Burned things?",
"Baby became quite red in the face with anger and confusion.",
"What sets an edge on a knife?",
"Good even, cousin.",
"Good cousin.",
"The man is blind.",
"There was no speaking tube for one thing.",
"No pocket of any sort was to be found.",
"The woman closed the hall door and locked it.",
"Push me over in the snow and make tracks.",
"She was blind!",
"He locked the door of the kitchen, so that I could not escape, and then took a long knife and came to kill me.",
"Then they perceived a great house and entered it, but nobody was there.",
"They revealed intellectual development far in advance of her years, and clear perception of character.",
"He was surprised by the natural manner in which his wish had suddenly been accomplished.",
"He took the magic skin out of his pocket, and looked at it.",
"When everything was ready, he locked the front door and went to bed.",
"By night and by day this presence sought me, ever alone, but always in such fashion as not to be perceived.",
"I gotta.",
"They in turn regarded him with something like respect.",
"Swing knew that these details were a string of lies.",
"I gotta have money.",
"She held the strip of white in her left hand.",
"Swing was not.",
"When he passed on his way the knife was no longer with him.",
"Gotta do it.",
"As it was his stomach seemed to roll over and over.",
"She opened it and spread it out against her knee.",
"It was not a sharp knife and the leather was tough.",
"His voice was more confident than his brain.",
"He must go to the river and wash first.",
"It was not a pleasant journey.",
"He has a pocket full of letters which he has read to me till I know them by heart.",
"The people are just crying out to be told what to do, and to be made to do it.",
"As to whether any of them did commit the murder, that is a question of personal character.",
"Hence these investigations.",
"It was a weird journey.",
"Little was said on that brief journey.",
"But these did not content the royal family.",
"He stood next after the king, and was the channel of royal favor.",
"It was a long journey in those times.",
"Stomach must have time for rest.",
"Feeding should in all cases be slow.",
"How bread is now regarded.",
"Danger of hot drinks.",
"Cold drinks.",
"Crying to sleep.",
"Case of the blind.",
"I am very much opposed to giving children hot drinks of any kind.",
"There is an excess, however, to which laughing, no less than crying, may be carried, and which we cannot too carefully avoid.",
"Perhaps they would do well, moreover, to deny that rules of any sort are valuable.",
"There is one more evil which will be avoided by having a child sleep alone.",
"The blind.",
"The wife was entitled to protection and support from her husband, and she retained her property independent of him.",
"He was one of the few who retain influence after they have lost power.",
"She was intellectual, accomplished, beautiful, and fascinating.",
"For a part of that shower reached us also.",
"I immediately perceived from his words that he would put me to death.",
"A revolution was accomplished.",
"It stuck out of the coat pocket a very little, but enough to be seen.",
"He fears nothing, he stops for nothing.",

"Keeping silence, I waited.",
"Here, during the greater part of the day, I maintained a strict watch over the gardens.",
"At the action, gentle though it was, he fell to pieces.",
"After that, I just waited.",
"We looked down upon an almost empty hall on those occasions.",
"So after much discussion it was decided to adopt black as the official dress and I must say it was an enormous improvement.",
"There was no conversation, merely an exchange of formal phrases, but I had some funny experiences.",
"It needs a more military spirit and discipline.",
"These phrases sound very simple, but perhaps they mean more than at first appears.",
"Have they enough money for ordinary occasions, and a little to give away?",
"He thus was able to silence every opponent.",
"Our distinguished host, whose guest she was, knew her reasons.",
"Slowly she paid off again, bearing away from them.",
"For an hour the unknown guided her.",
"Discipline, while strict, was not conventional.",
"To my surprise the gate was open.",
"My cigarette material, I find, is short.",
"If only I had my cigarette supply.",
"There was a sheet of paper in his hand which seemed to have some bearing on his trouble.",
"They waited.",
"And waited.",
"We had not been discovered, and waited for the other boats to arrive.",
"Is the current of progress to flow by them for ever, bearing no reforms which shall affect them?",
"We shall have to live as our fathers lived, be subject to disease as they were, grow old as they grew old, and die as they died.",
"Besides, gentle friends!",
"Take aim!",
"This arrangement was made, and her room opens into mine.",
"Besides, there is no one in the room, that I can swear.",
"I put out the light, sat on the edge of the bed, and waited the issue of events.",
"I have only the one day to spare, so am off early in the morning.",
"He was going to meet her tonight, through his own arrangement.",
"She waited on till the train started.",
"He waited one moment more.",
"Then she waited.",
"She would not leave her place in the gate.",
"She took off all the clothes she could spare.",
"She waited and waited.",
"I must even go farther as the roads are made.",
"There was a wind above my head, and I thought that I could almost put words to the tune.",
"She was educated just like other girls, except that her lessons were read to her.",
"Naturally, many difficulties had to be encountered.",
"Sometimes even they would venture into the gardens and carry off women and children.",
"Swear I would!",
"It was she who moved first, falling back from him, her mouth dropping open slightly.",
"We waited a moment, and then let go and ran for it.",
"As the days were growing short, night soon came on, and I looked around for a suitable camping place.",
"Every man jumped for his horse.",
"I returned their fire and had the satisfaction of seeing one of them fall from his horse.",
"He was not, however, going in the right direction, but bearing too far to the east, and I so informed him.",
"Is the passion of their sleep.",
"Dust had returned to dust.",
"All human operations were suspended.",
"Love can reach down when in loving trust we reach up.",
"A wave of passion broke over him.",
"He looked round upon them, this man who found his joy in helping others, and waited for their answer.",
"He waited a moment.",
"Who packed at the last camp?",
"They waited for her.",
"Everybody had jumped up.",
"Some of the men pulled the bed farther out, so that they, too, could pass round and see.",
"He might even say most of that dust was his, anyway.",
"They waited a long time for her to come back.",
"Why on the sudden all this nice examining?",
"To let children get that beauty should be our aim, and they must get it in their own way.",
"There is nearly always some part of a meal on the table, and some washing hanging up.",
"We got to the bottom of an awful hill, and packed all our stuff from there to the hill above the lake.",
"The men fell in and waited.",
"But, for the moment, this proved the least of his many difficulties because no immediate results were required.",
"But I had none of the satisfaction of a completed work.",
"Her letters, her papers, her books, each coming at its appointed hour, were all instruments of pleasure.",
"Neither did any one venture to ask her again whether she had been successful in her mission.",
"And she was not aware what guided her, but yet turned her face in the appointed way without any doubt.",
"Come no farther.",
"Far, far from me my husband stays!",
"We must see how matters turn out, and be guided by the event.",
"But surely it had a bearing on the case?",
"Anybody in the room would have been able to swear to them.",
"I feel like a bite.",
"I can lift him now.",
"When she had finished what she had to do, she sat down, and waited.",
"Only if it stopped at the gate would he have to take action.",
"It did stop at the gate.",
"Then its engine was shut off, and a man got out of it, and came up to the garden gate.",
"A suitable place should be selected.",
"The most suitable place is the church.",
"It is his passion.",
"His danger, if not his difficulties, might be overcome now.",
"They tied their animals and held a council of war.",
"A loving man or woman can never want for love.",
"So he stays in hell to do it.",
"She packed up and left.",
"So will we fall upon them and they, taken by surprise, shall seek to escape us by the gate.",
"Quantity, not quality, becomes the great objective.",
"He saw one foot suspended for the next step, as though the sight of him kept her back in fear.",
"Since that time I have waited.",
"Never once did he venture a comment.",
"Moreover, an audience was gathering.",
"And so she waited.",
"I was perfectly sure that they would find nothing in any way bearing upon the mystery.",
"And then I saw that the wire had been cut.",
"He was examining it at the time he died.",
"Then his eyes encountered mine.",
"She loved fine phrases as she loved fine clothes.",
"I am not sure that it would be suitable if they did.",
"I offered her a lift and she rid with me a spell.",
"I told him, well, I could spare them, too.",
"He turned and waited for her to come up.",
"He jumped farther than any of them.",
"Here he passed his spare time in reading.",
"They went down to the river, and waited for them.",
"He was very gentle.",
"But while the soldiers filled up the house she could not do any washing.",
"No sleep came to their eyes while they waited for light to travel by.",
"Then the fine wood dust would smoke.",
"They reached from the gate to the door of his house.",
"She was farther north than any ship had ever been before.",
"They held up the little flag that they had carried farther north than anybody had ever been before.",
"She had to do the washing.",
"It is an instrument as well as an index.",
"Nevertheless there are occasions for us to speak.",
"Frequent occasions.",
"That we may make the most of the important occasions sure to come, we must have our instruments ready.",
"He just traded for it.",
"Fit, suitable, appropriate, proper.",
"But nowadays our people want more.",
"All the same, she did not mean to submit.",
"The trouble was, he had not enjoyed the scientific training that distinguished the men who got important posts.",
"Now the shareholders were not numerous and the ships were small.",
"It was plain they felt the chairman had gone farther than he ought.",
"She waited, rather hoping he would pass, until he looked round and advanced to meet her.",
"Somehow he might get the necessary sum, but if the venture failed, it would be the last.",
"The following are some extracts from my notes.",
"He had but little time to spare.",
"Bone, turning to shut the gate, felt a cold hand on his arm.",
"He waited a minute.",
"Architecture is dead and gone to dust long ago.",
"I ran again, farther than at first.",
"The amount of power to be generated in both living and dead machines is simply a question of quality and quantity of provision for the purpose.",
"Among these latter are the symbols.",
"Without being highly educated, he was a man of reading and intelligence.",
"She came to a gate.",
"She reached another gate.",
"They would break down any gate she chose.",
"Ice had already formed in vessels.",
"Lying in bed, patient, gentle.",
"They are immediately the distinguished guests.",
"Even men, let us venture the suggestion, like change for the mere sake of change.",
"There was no discipline in the pension system.",
"The trade unions, with a thought to possible competitors, have favored protecting them from night work.",
"But the discipline will not come from the gods.",
"State school or college where educated.",
"He helped his opponent to his feet.",
"Another jumped in with him.",
"He took aim and fired.",
"Below the surface of the water his hands encountered the struggling figures.",
"He waited in the garden about half an hour, and as everything in the house seemed quite still, he made his way to a side window and forced it open.",
"The gate was open and I thought that strange, but I had no thought of murder.",
"She caught the train with a few seconds to spare.",
"But this involved difficulties.",
"The arrangement of rooms on the second floor was well known to me.",
"I could not swear that in my opinion it was?",
"With the dropping of the glasses, we all drew back from the table, and walked towards a little room where we sometimes sat before going into the library.",
"Then we waited, looking at each other.",
"Suddenly he encountered my eye.",
"He drew back and waited.",
"He could tell it farther than man.",
"He knew that his master would not spare him.",
"He had taken the life from him, and his master would not spare him.",
"If they did not reach it soon, within half an hour, she would be able to go no farther.",
"One day they struck farther than usual to the west.",
"He cut off their heads and hung them up at the gate.",
"Then he waited a little while.",
"Immediately the animal jumped up and started to run away.",
"Farther on, he saw a man who played with a ball, and his children were old men.",
"They tried to lift him up.",
"It is certain, however, that they offered human victims to their gods.",
"Sometimes a quantity of blood was drawn from the patient, previously to the experiment taking place.",
"For instance, he soon came to know that his father and mother had very little money to spare, and that his father had to work hard to get what money they had.",
"I think the reason children get tired of their toys so soon is just that it is against human nature to be really interested in what is of no use.",
"But I waited for him to speak, and the moment passed.",
"For I had no home to go to, nor was there any waiting to welcome me, and the woman I loved seemed farther away than ever, though now she was so near.",
"The house could not be much farther on.",
"He puts his own conduct in an ideal light, and the conduct of his opponent in the reverse!",
"Wire roads.",
"Up he jumped, fired at the prospect of seeing new and wonderful things, and without looking any more to see who had spoken to him, he ran over to it.",
"He received a wire, and had to leave immediately.",
"Strange, I thought, but although I waited in the club nearly an hour, he did not put in an appearance.",
"On the second a council was held which sat late into the night.",
"Such criticism fails entirely to understand both the aim and the scope of his policy.",
"His ruling passion was, however, strong in death.",
"I talked for a few moments to the driver, who gave me a piece of cake and some wine.",
"He went on to speak of economic difficulties.",
"There was a large gathering.",
"Strange that it still stays valuable.",
"When he spoke, it seemed a weak appeal to justify his action.",
"They believe if they keep hidden, if I do not suspect, that I may venture forth.",
"My father became very gentle.",
"Thus, when she turned in at the gate, he was there by the time she had reached the front door.",
"And I shall justify my belief.",
"That little man is a live wire of intelligence.",
"The discipline of this family must be maintained.",
"The boxes that his mother had packed with so much care arrived in a few days.",
"Both parties called the gods to witness.",
"But these political combinations failed.",
"They burned their city and put themselves to death rather than submit.",
"The poor woman, with her crying, was drawing attention to them, and, perhaps, gathering a crowd.",
"Let us keep that before us, day and night, as the aim and purpose of our lives.",
"Certain plants produce dreams on particular occasions.",
"Witness the following extracts.",
"As for himself he remained with the reserve.",
"So did our fathers, and so must we do.",
"He would have gone farther any day on such a business.",
"Nothing like defining of terms when we talk.",
"She was washing.",
"He assumed there was another passenger after all, one who must have been sitting in the front seat, and too low for his head to be visible.",
"But he was happy that all of the dust had been removed from his screen.",
"This, however, was to be only a temporary arrangement.",
"But if it is, how can he resist it?",
"It was a heavy blow to her, but she had the satisfaction of finding that his mind was at peace when he drew near his end.",
"But far beyond any local gathering, her example will continue to speak, through all the ages, and in many a land.",
"Something of what this blow meant to the loving daughter may be gathered from her letters.",
"The man did not come again to them for some time, but they learned that he was appointed governor of some villages a distance away.",
"I have been around among those who live near us, and I find some who are even now examining the new religion.",
"Extracts from it may serve to give some insight into her thoughts and life.",
"The great day of the gathering was especially bright.",
"And wise in every thing but in loving me.",
"And this was all the complaint which this gentle lady made.",
"He was chief in council, and in the field.",
"Near him his sister stays.",
"But I hope it will be understood that I do this at a venture, and, except in a few cases, with no exact knowledge.",
"A wise man reduces his affairs to a minimum, and his interest in the affairs of his neighbor to less.",
"The cigarette dropped from his fingers to the floor.",
"Passion, like character, does not grow in crowded places.",
"Some of them he knew to be educated.",
"The posts were there, but the wire was gone.",
"I too have had my difficulties.",
"All we require, then, little fathers, is organization.",
"Farther than that he did not go.",
"It is at such moments that we find that we are not gods, but only men.",
"There they stood and waited.",
"The room was packed with them.",
"Would the result be worth what he was putting into the venture?",
"I would venture a different putting of it.",
"Would each district group please get together at once, and select some one to represent the group on this council?",
"Told us to put into the truck anything we could spare.",
"But those countries have waited a long while.",
"No one might know what inner urge had driven them here.",
"He had a seat in the city council.",
"One player holds in his hand a number of these toys, and demands of another whether that number is even or odd.",
"And it was the same with phrases.",
"She did it now with a kind of passion, to say nothing of her knowing, with it, that every word of it added to her beauty.",
"Nothing tends more to the satisfaction of both employer and employed, than this arrangement.",
"The quantity of oil may be increased when it is much liked.",
"It must be rather slow, and the cake not allowed to brown at all.",
"Should the above proportion of sugar not be found sufficient to suit some tastes, increase the quantity.",
"When the patient is very low, use double the quantity of meat to the same proportion of water.",
"A small quantity of this may be given in a little water at any time, and always with benefit.",
"He had been to examine the place a week previous, and had brought home the key of the gate, being determined to take it.",
"A few further remarks may justify this somewhat severe estimate.",
"He immediately distinguished himself as a working member.",
"What he wanted was perfectly correct but was not just suitable at that moment, and he needed an explanation.",
"She always brought forward her most awful ideas when it was least suitable.",
"Throwing the gate to with great violence, he turned the huge key before pulling it rapidly out.",
"If they were all to talk to her at once, as had happened several times before, no one would have any satisfaction, as she might not even be able to understand them.",
"But when everything stays the same for so long and there is no prospect of any change, it is so hard to keep this faith.",
"There are still a few that the old country could spare.",
"His only aim was to beat the other newspapers and to serve his employers.",
"Business was generally suspended and none of the daily papers would be issued on the following day.",
"A few doors farther on was his home.",
"Tomorrow is going to be bad and no one will fly unless they call for volunteers, and then I think most of us will go.",
"Things look bad, and in a few days we are moving farther up.",
"Developments quickly followed.",
"This capture had an important bearing on the subsequent fighting.",
"It is only my left eye and I aim with my right.",
"We took careful aim all the while.",
"And their advance could get no farther.",
"At length we jumped out into the open.",
"All are supported by their regular funds, supplemented by contributions entirely apart from those funds.",
"Do we not both take from the poor people that which they can ill spare?",
"Schools and universities become clearly visible.",
"They issue a very large paper currency on a very small gold reserve.",
"In both, to reason right is to submit.",
"A mystery no less to gods than men!",
"Gate, way.",
"Lift, sky.",
"Thus he lost many of his own men in searching for and bringing provisions, and many by his own discipline.",
"This had a bearing upon all of them.",
"She stays right with the job.",
"It seemed there had been some trouble in catching them.",
"Nearly every family north of the river had some cause for loving the little man.",
"Plain I have called it, but I do not mean to imply that it was by any means level.",
"I doubt whether I should have had the power to resist his will had I thought it wise to do so.",
"The bite was easily avoided.",
"Some one waited for her there.",
"It was a big, closed car, covered with dust.",
"The driver stopped it at the gate and got out.",
"They aim to take advantage of the war situation.",
"There was dust between his teeth.",
"The little country town appeared dead, and buried under dust.",
"But he ought to have waited.",
"Then he waited.",
"But she was somehow different from what she had seemed upon the other occasions he had seen her.",
"There was something that guided events.",
"It sent my blood racing.",
"His voice was weak and had a spent ring of passion in it.",
"If this war only lets me live long enough to understand its meaning!",
"The family waited then for further news.",
"We have educated men and religious men.",
"Almost at once I washed out another wire and soon another and another.",
"If he has capabilities of administration, our government does not yet believe in them.",
"Really I was not aware that I was a distinguished character of any kind.",
"A great many over there send back their sons and daughters to be educated.",
"His interest was concentrated elsewhere, and, in all probability, he could not swear whether I was black or white.",
"There were some difficulties ahead, to be sure.",

"I jumped in and managed to get the last empty seat.",
"In the evening, one of the staff dropped me off at the bus stand where I waited and waited for the bus, which never arrived.",
"The county, as distinguished from the city, has no claim to particular consideration.",
"Might we not hope for success, if we have calculated the events of war, and made a suitable preparation?",
"But it is certain, that her new troops must have been without arms and without discipline.",
"If it be asked, what is farther to be expected from these troops?",
"But it is not necessary that such reserve should be in the hands of a government.",
"All these races have been, and will still be, farther noticed in the progress of the work.",
"If we had his mind, and his tongue, we could spare the rest.",
"The crowd waited for him to say something.",
"Whether I spoke at all or not until we reached her gate I have never known.",

"We swear it here on this spot.",
"We waited.",
"It almost seems now as if I had been guided here.",

"She went farther.",
"I was early, but if she had waited, she would of course not know this.",
"Lying there, I missed her every hour of the day, recalled every gentle act, kind word, and fair example she had given me.",
"Where, then, does limitation come from?",
"Some bite by day only, some by night, and others at all times.",
"As it was, they turned and entered the first, and indeed the only gate which offered.",
"A system of strict but liberal economy had been adopted in the case of his sons.",

"He can never have written in other than a gentle mood.",
"Such symbols are the true bodies of the true ideas.",
"I began crying instead, for by this time I was afraid to venture anything more.",
"It was only upon rare occasions that my grandmother said anything to him.",
"The only thing which I am careful, in the first draft, to make as perfect as I am able, is the arrangement.",
"He went up to his room, and in getting them from his bag, saw the little instrument case which he had thrown into his bag when he was changing.",
"She went back to her place and he waited until she had done so before he began to open the letters.",

"But it requires no argument to justify the course I took.",
"I was glad I was not sitting on the gate, for I might have fallen and broken my neck.",
"I had nothing in stock, but wondered if it would be possible to make one for him while he waited.",

"Yet whatever the result, there was no avoiding it.",
"Nothing occurred causing me to fear my movements were detected.",
"Naturally we were enemies.",
"The responses satisfied me.",
"Likely enough they failed to understand what had been said, but I had no further time to waste in explanations.",

"Their very voices held a world of difference.",
"Here was an animal that could bear him like the wind wherever he would go.",
"He stepped out again, his right hand extended, his voice soft.",
"Immediately it was followed by the least of negative movements of her head.",
"Not the police alone, but others, enemies even more dangerous, might be expecting him by that route.",
"So long as he remained at the wheel, they were not only in safe hands but might be sure of losing nothing on the road.",

"He got up and flew at them.",
"The dogs simply flew over those last miles.",
"Told me to do what I liked with that tent.",
"He reaches out his hand and takes whatever he wants, just as a baby would, quite simply, and as a matter of course.",
"No, I do not pretend that this is easy to do.",
"And so in a general way at least the concentrated experience of school must fill gaps and supply experiences that life has not provided for.",
"This, however, neither he nor any one else could accomplish.",
"With the rest of the party I started to carry on the survey, which may now be said to have fairly started ahead on the lakes.",
"The police committee was of the usual kind and dealt with usual problems in the usual way.",
"At last, however, the craft was passing, showing her port side, not very far distant, to be sure.",
"But what caught my eye was the figure that stood before the tent.",
"I could not be expected to adjust my views in the short space of a night.",
"I will not pretend that I liked the business.",
"Say that I am going into the hills to find if my fears are justified.",
"My heart, too, was full of cares.",
"Before we had thought only of our danger and cares, but now we had a vision of the reward.",
"The house will be all dark, and they will be breaking their hearts.",
"He knows what is in our hearts about those we have left, and why he sent for us before them.",
"We do not read their hearts, like him.",
"And whenever our hearts were sick for news it was but to go to him, and he told us everything.",
"He is left to his will, and is permitted to do it as it seems good in his eyes.",
"But who cares?",
"I never saw him stopping short.",
"The true spirit of partnership!",
"These matters will be dealt with by a commission of learned men which is soon to be formed.",
"This information demanded immediate attention.",
"And, no doubt, as much coal as now exists has been destroyed, after its formation, in this way.",
"Long gaps are cut in its broken surface.",
"Just my blamed luck!",
"She stopped and colored.",
"As she anticipated, her father was not at home.",
"To her credit be it said she did not pose as an injured woman.",
"This did constitute a unique contribution to the science of politics.",
"And when the knife reaches its mark it ends a battle at a stroke.",
"She put one foot on the lowest step of the stairs.",
"He went to the foot of the stairs, even past the old woman, and, raising his head, he spoke to the girl.",
"And now they sat side by side before the tent and still she asked no questions about what was to come.",
"For the musicians could not watch the notes and the door at the same time.",
"He had not killed his brother, he had murdered him.",
"But I kept those doubts to myself.",
"I have never had that privilege.",
"Down the hall they went, then up a flight of wooden stairs which carried them to a covered bridge, and so to the upper story of the factory.",
"And now the present enterprise began to shape itself in her mind.",
"With one movement she threw off the switch, thus stopping the engine, entirely.",
"It had come, and it was worse than she could have anticipated.",
"He put out his arms and gathered her into a close embrace.",
"Sometimes he changed his hiding place suddenly.",
"Sometimes there was no wood and no coal in the house in cold weather.",
"Name all the bones of the human head.",
"He gave them every privilege and all the protection his government could afford.",
"He asked me after this what I would give for the privilege per month.",
"My freedom is a privilege which nothing else can equal.",
"All the same, there was nothing to be said, and she went to her tent.",
"When the engineer saw the light it would be too late.",
"When he picked up the menu card he understood why girls from the stores and offices used the place.",
"The engineer was kind.",
"At length she got up, and stopping at the door for a moment gave him her hand.",
"Then I knew her wages were not high.",
"Her husband had never failed her and he had justified her trust again.",
"Then much depends on the engineer.",
"He colored, but gave her a steady look.",
"Other forms of coal took the human face.",
"I went in and took it up, with a box of matches lying near, and once more started down the stairs.",
"But in a moment the thought of the future checked that regret.",
"When the song is over, the cards are dealt.",
"Soon her wages reflected the contrast.",
"It would be well, perhaps, if industrial women were permitted to guide their own ship.",
"That would be accepting international calm at the expense of domestic differences.",
"She knows how hard it is to earn money, and has learned to make her wages reach a long way.",
"In any case the fact must be faced that these agricultural units will not do domestic work.",
"These are the social processes which command most surely the hearts and minds of women.",
"For some time no more bombs dropped near.",
"The people demanded to be told the facts.",
"The door flew open without a sound.",
"He counted the hearts.",
"He followed me down stairs and let me out at the side door.",
"He went over his notes carefully and dealt with the evidence of each of the witnesses.",
"I stood still in the hall with my eyes fixed on the stairs above.",
"The shock caused by the discovery that he had been murdered had passed away, and she had begun to accept his violent death as part of her own experience of life.",
"But some of it was extremely interesting when it dealt with actual facts, and some of the facts were quite new to me.",
"He walked to the head of the stairs and began to walk slowly down them.",
"Then I flew to the windows.",
"What could occasion my doubts, and why did I not fly the place?",
"She seemed to think him justified in this.",
"He studied the spaces between.",
"That I wanted him to stay until I had had time to think and adjust myself to these new conditions.",
"I hardly blamed the mother.",
"Arrived at the top of the stairs, I heard what drove me from the house at once.",
"I flew after him and caught him in the lower hall.",
"There was movement in the tent.",
"Go into the tent, and sleep.",
"In the tent there was silence.",
"Pulling down the tent was a task.",
"She exposed it for a time on the top of the tent.",
"They decided who was guilty and demanded price of blood for those killed in the market.",
"When I arrive at the tent of this lady I will strike a stake with my stick.",
"He goes and goes without stopping, until he comes to the country of the sand.",
"He showed himself ahead of all his peers.",
"He sees the bottom of their hearts, and lists.",
"The woman in the tent, seeing that the ship would not come first to her, went out first in front.",
"The next morning he demanded his old woman.",
"The bird flew toward the woman.",
"Our dreams, moreover, are so far from being the effect of a voluntary effort, that we neither know of what we shall dream, or whether we shall dream at all.",
"What rich prospects!",
"We have seen how she has lost a very large part of her iron and a considerable quantity of her coal.",
"Before it could find a fresh place to get out at, the whole upper part of the garden was one network of lakes and islands.",
"The week which followed flew by like a dream.",
"I took a last look around my room, picked up my pack, and started down the stairs.",
"We sat long into the night talking of the past and of the future, and of the great things we were going to accomplish.",
"The reason refused to acknowledge such a thing.",
"If they had a leader and a chance to combine, they might do a great deal of harm.",
"He looked at me a moment longer before answering.",
"Shall I look on and see him murdered?",
"The crash of the towers that fall!",
"It was a privilege to see that victory in the making.",
"These pools soon dried up and the water problem again became serious.",
"The stores and dealers have none.",
"The schools are closing, as there is no coal.",
"Neither coal nor vegetables can be bought.",
"There are no words to describe the large hearts of these men.",
"As it was, he had dropped his bombs, and he insisted on making his report in hospital.",
"He offered us chairs and sat down himself.",
"How should I know anything about such a craft?",
"I regret to say she is very ill indeed.",
"Suddenly, however, a second gun, an answering signal, was fired from straight before us, and that revealed the truth.",
"A man and woman were found murdered up in the wood about a mile and a half from the castle.",
"This was easy to accomplish.",
"He had been, by turns, a civil engineer and an actor, and had a fine singing voice.",
"There were pools of water everywhere on the floor.",
"We loaded our guns on to trucks, and waited several hours in the station yard for the promised train.",
"But none of the bombs fell very close to us.",
"He demanded too much of his troops.",
"I thought I knew what dreams were in their hearts, and, if I was right, those dreams were also mine.",
"Another man was hit just outside, and lay on the ground screaming like an animal in pain.",
"This view of things was justified by the events which followed.",
"The plane flew very low over us.",
"They will never adjust themselves to the proper time and place.",
"I regret that mine is a black one.",
"I stood listening to her step on the stairs.",
"But I think she knew without my answering, for she laughed again, and I did not entirely blame her.",
"Was she really murdered?",
"The newspaper man had his doubts.",
"I have my doubts.",
"Mountain had found and preserved.",
"Every man of them was murdered as he fell.",
"He lived about one year longer, and seems to have maintained his influence as long as his health permitted.",
"At the close of the civil war he would have had little or nothing to do unless he had turned his attention to some foreign enterprise.",
"By her words she was justified.",
"We will not pretend to what we do not feel.",
"Just as far as our hearts are full of love we shall see something worth loving in every human being we meet, and love them for that.",
"And the burden of responsibility, the regret for failure, is more than I can bear.",
"But let us poor men lift up our hearts.",
"Must one regret their loss?",
"He looked at the tent with pleased approval.",
"I felt that I had something else to do than to regret.",
"I had no more muscles that day.",
"But were we justified in doing that?",
"Give me a mirror!",
"No, I can feel it in my bones.",
"Come on out of hiding.",
"They were told to get chairs.",
"It was not without heavy hearts that they saw the years passing away and nothing apparently being done.",
"Then calling to him his second daughter, he demanded what she had to say.",
"How strong his muscles!",
"Who cares, so long as my old friends remember me?",
"He led the way up the narrow stairs.",
"The whole scene was typical of life in the northern capital, where wealth wages a successful fight against climate.",
"She turned and looked at herself in the mirror.",
"I shall always regret that, and I shall always hate her.",
"She had dealt with such men before.",
"His only craft was forest craft.",
"He had to peer into the face of the watch in order to see the hands.",
"He seemed to be reflecting.",
"He went down stairs and opened the little door at the back of the castle.",
"They were forcing their way to the front.",
"He led her up the narrow stairs to her own room.",
"I went off without answering him.",
"Why not say something of the whole program of our church as it affects our colored people?",
"It had a few great names, we must acknowledge, in those early times.",
"Any religious work that reaches them now has almost to begin all over again.",
"Take the work for colored people, for instance.",
"Then take the meat from the bones, cut it into small square pieces, and throw them into cold water.",
"A medium has to be observed, in order that as few as possible escape being caught in the net, and as many as possible preserved alive in it.",
"It is used both fresh and preserved.",
"The key to both the mother will find in her own heart, and the knowledge of her success in the comfort and smile of her infant.",
"If only the child were like that, then I should have no more cares.",
"I get the cares without looking for them.",
"The mother, after attending to some task, followed the children, who were standing around the piano.",
"The arrangements have all been made.",
"Wages were low and there was absolutely no money to speak of.",
"They must be dealt with upon sight if dealt with at all.",
"It must be a league of honor, a partnership of opinion.",
"To have lived on the principal battle ground of the world war was a privilege the author did not appreciate at the time.",
"I put him under a tent and he acted as if he had a fit.",
"Her hands flew to her breast.",
"We dropped our bombs and then I turned to the right to see the damage.",
"To the west is a rich agricultural country.",
"As far as possible the bodies were buried at night, each attending to its own fallen.",
"The opposition has proved to be more serious than was anticipated.",
"Even in the prison camp the long arm of these friendly organizations reaches out to aid him.",
"At last he fixed in his mind that he would offer such a prize as they would not care to shoot for.",
"Walk alone she could certainly, and always did, except on those occasions of ceremony that demanded a partner.",
"This was his usual method of appearing after a long absence.",
"They both watched the large tent.",
"As he did so the other figure stepped forward, so that the space between them was preserved.",
"The division was in some sense a natural one, emphasized by differences of language and of race.",
"They have become before all things an agricultural people, drawing almost everything they need from their own soil.",
"We hold that war can be justified only by a good cause, not by a lucky event.",
"Even as things are, there have been some gains in the manner of conducting war, which, when future generations look back on them, will be seen to be considerable.",
"I do not pretend to explain the change.",
"Tent, watch.",
"Good wages to the right person.",
"All screaming.",
"This I had anticipated.",
"At last he permitted me to take leave.",
"I asked, however, simply, and giving no reason, for the production of any papers received and preserved by either.",
"Nothing whatever has been found on the ground or at the station, not even parts of the bombs.",
"The original documents are preserved in the above office and may be seen by anyone who cares to apply.",
"He had dealt with many and many a trial.",
"The train appeared to be going slowly through without stopping.",
"It was dry, hard and hot either from the sun or its own generating power.",
"So from all sides she was justified.",
"She heard his quick step on the stairs.",
"Yet, as the words formed, her whole heart seemed to be behind them, forcing them out.",
"I justified my resolve.",
"Then he went to the other end to peer over there.",
"Who was this person whose image stood reflected in the mirror?",
"He dealt with them fairly.",
"When we went down the bank the boats were just pushing from the shore, with bags of coal.",
"The engineer showed him his plan.",
"But after these are all accounted for, there is still a real difference.",
"Beyond the lakes lie the mountains.",
"The stairs lead up from the front hall.",
"What might I still hope to accomplish?",
"And if I was to accomplish this end it must be attempted at once.",
"Full strength had come back to my muscles, and my head was again clear.",
"I have nerve enough and once I start that sort of thing there is no stopping.",
"Our only chance is the stairs.",
"I may even take the privilege of reading them tomorrow, for in that way I can perhaps discover some evidence that will force him to stop this ugly business.",
"There was an effort in her smile answering him.",
"She could hear him at work, hiding his gold.",
"She felt that she could run all night without stopping.",
"Of these notes I have preserved as much as was consistent with the limits and design of the following work.",
"But that leaves the lakes to be accounted for.",
"If ever it be permitted, it ought in the present season.",
"There were about a dozen chairs for the older people.",
"They would waste more than their wages, and what they did not waste they would steal.",
"He was not, however, permitted to remain in peace in his new home.",
"But this scheme was not permitted to be carried out.",
"But he is happy now, and we will not regret him.",
"They ate and were satisfied, for it was summer on the earth and summer in their hearts.",
"The bones are all useful in building our houses.",
"He loved this mirror, and often stood before it for an hour at a time.",
"Such a screaming as that old woman made!",
"There were some chairs on this platform and a small table.",
"He says there is no need of screaming at any animal.",
"I get a great many bones here, and I should be glad if I had some poor, city dogs to help me eat them.",
"The news passed up stairs.",
"But, be that as it may, the fact that coal is buried forest is not affected.",
"And as the bones of the face are influenced, so are the teeth influenced.",
"Follow changes in the skin, the bones, the nervous system and the mind.",
"The dinner hour flew by all too quickly.",
"No man can join a partnership and remain an absolutely free man.",
"It is the second question that needs answering.",
"But these people who pretend to lead us will state nothing of the sort.",
"Difficult to make arrangements.",
"I went down stairs, with doubts in my mind as to the way the thing would turn out.",
"She is a prize.",
"I am permitted by my father to do what I please, and my heart is my own.",
"A fragment of an army was consequently brought into action, and the result was what had been anticipated.",

"He began to dance before the mirror.",
"It flew all over the room.",
"The mirror would not answer this time.",
"Then he dealt the first blow with his pick.",
"If, as he anticipated, the child were dead, the affair would go no further.",
"It is by stopping that we might do ourselves harm.",
"Was it not impossible to accept life without accepting death.",
"They were both reflecting.",
"The facts can certainly be accounted for without that assumption.",
"Heart me no hearts!",
"Even when I had explained my plans and she was willing to admit the possibility of success, she still felt doubts as to whether it would be right for her to leave the country while her friends were left behind in danger.",

"Real charity never cares to make an exhibition of itself.",
"The heart of the whole nation was in the enterprise.",
"Having given these subjects much study I wish to state here what has already been done and what we may hope to accomplish.",
"To the east was a wide gap in the investing lines.",
"A modern corporation is a means of cooperation in the conduct of an enterprise which is so big that no one can conduct it, and which the resources of no one man are sufficient to finance.",
"There was some one coming down the stairs now.",
"I had seen something fall from the hand of the murdered man.",
"He had many arrangements to make.",
"Perhaps he, too, had anticipated this moment.",
"Be satisfied that something answering to them has had a being.",
"He anticipated no excuse, and found none.",

"No part of the nation was permitted to act for itself.",
"The people were well shaped and painted, like those which have been already described.",
"He preserved himself always independent, and was never known to be guilty of a lie.",
"In every great performance, perhaps in every great character, part is the gift of nature, part the contribution of accident, and part, very often not the greatest part, the effect of voluntary election, and regular design.",
"If any new evidence shall appear, or any doubts arise, both the parties shall be heard.",
"It has been proposed, either to fix the price of provisions with respect to them, or to advance their wages in some proportion to the price of provisions.",
"The doctor had with him an assistant, and tent to himself.",
"For some time after this day I did not see him very often, and of the conversation which I did enjoy, I am sorry to find I have preserved but little.",

"That I am sure is what the charm has done for us.",
"The ship rolled heavily.",
"The officers pressed forward.",
"The first remark I lost.",
"I approached him.",
"The morning wore, and we rapidly approached the island.",
"I made out some object rolled about in the edge of the wash.",
"We landed at each one of these places.",
"The men did not remark it.",
"From a distance it presented a truly imposing sight.",

"But then, he was only an uncle.",
"Darkness has fallen.",
"The hour grows late.",
"His face was in shadow.",
"They listened, and soon their worst fears were confirmed.",
"All things considered, it is perhaps not surprising that he got into bad habits himself.",
"He let his bag slip to the floor.",
"How that child worries over little things.",
"Have I ever landed anywhere but on my feet?",
"She read it, but, somehow, her mind would not register.",
"She found the switch, pressed it.",

"A report of what had happened was rapidly spreading all over the school.",
"But I am none the less grateful.",
"Her attitude was to him not convincing.",
"Every one seemed to feel that there was something in the air, the shadow of a possibly serious development in the case.",
"At the door, which stood open, I stopped and listened.",
"He saw something was wrong and pressed me to tell him what had happened.",
"As I approached he introduced us.",
"They soon disappeared from view in the darkness.",
"I never saw a more grateful woman than she was.",
"They were perfectly aware of the fact that I had acted without orders and entirely on my own responsibility, and therefore they felt the more grateful.",
"He finally got up and went to the room with the intention of cleaning out the whole crowd.",
"I did not consider this movement a reflection upon my character, for it seemed but appropriate that he should do it.",
"The eyes were rolled up until only the whites were visible.",
"Her uncle laughed.",
"His face was white and drawn with pain and there were heavy rings beneath his eyes.",
"She found her new uncle very pleasant.",
"Our real and our ideal are not twins.",
"Love is like the seed.",
"She had supposed when she became of age there would be some change, but her uncle had made no reference to the subject and she had not liked to ask.",
"Back to the door, head up, he listened.",
"Naturally neither listened.",
"A shadow on the ice.",
"Nobody listened.",
"He gives up all idea of ever going home, and even if he makes a fortune, they say, he stays on here.",
"A shadow crossed the kind face opposite.",

"Then I saw his intention.",
"My uncle was a rich man, but no firm could afford these repeated losses.",
"But it was of no set intention that I answered as I did.",
"Tell me, brother, did he sing all the while, as was his custom?",
"At first the boys talked and the girls listened.",
"But the occasion seemed to have passed for that as well as other kinds of emotion.",
"And it was very clear that till she pleased she would take no hint.",
"This strange scene, which she did not understand, seemed to make itself visible all in a moment out of the darkness, and then disappeared again as suddenly as it came.",
"For one thing, they had remained quite close to the gate, which no doubt threw a shadow.",
"The darkness and the horrible way seemed as nothing to her.",
"Yet only to hear the sound was enough to transport all who listened, and to make them know what joy is and peace.",
"They must not see it nor know it, for the land of darkness is beyond hope.",
"In the land of darkness there are no dreams nor voices that speak within us.",
"There are none in the land of darkness.",
"His mother had noticed it before I left home, but would not say anything to alarm me.",
"But the more serious part of the matter pressed upon me now.",
"I pressed his hand on my arm, not feeling able to speak.",
"It was begun without any special intention on my part.",
"I pressed his arm again.",
"Cars always alarm him.",
"He listened again.",
"Is intention required in reading the hours?",
"But what intention ought we to have?",
"The major took the hint.",
"The truth is, there was nothing left for us but to go out or be kicked out.",
"They will follow to the stream, and I think I have given them the slip there.",
"No one had noticed him in the panic.",
"A man or woman old enough to have a grown daughter is old enough to know whether he wants to marry again.",
"A belt of silver!",
"A few men, however, standing on the mountain ranges of human observation, saw the future more clearly than did the mass.",
"A dozen years ago his parents died and they sent him to my care, for my fortune was then comfortable.",
"But clothes were the least part of his worries.",
"Had he been there to see, even in the darkness he would have known, and he could have crossed the distance between their lives with a single step, and taken her into his heart.",
"I am full of weaknesses.",
"He lay back in his chair, his hands pressed over his eyes.",
"He listened, but he was not convinced.",
"At any rate, he ignored the hint.",
"He pressed the combination at the right side of the desk, instead of that at the left side.",
"I came up to hunt for him.",
"She gathered the sheets together and pressed them to her face as though they were flowers, or the hands of little children.",
"Many of the white people learned to hunt.",
"But he could not get any seed rice to plant.",
"The cook had one little bag of seed rice.",
"It was all saved for seed.",
"As long as they lived they listened to his advice.",
"He knew how to hunt the wild animals.",
"They meant to slip out past our ships of war.",
"Everybody praised it.",
"She looked around and listened.",
"But at last they praised him.",
"He listened.",
"Any topic for discussion or explanation becomes, when approached from some particular angle, material for argument.",
"We must now lay the original meaning alongside the central meaning today, in order to draw our conclusions.",
"What significance does this relationship possess?",
"But normally it is our ill fortune to learn through chance rather than through system.",
"Have, possess, own, hold.",
"This is he which received seed by the way side.",
"She would not marry a poor man.",
"He thought her hint about the shares giving him useful power was significant.",
"He picked up the weather chart and got no comfort.",
"She had left home without much breakfast, in the dark, and was cold and rather depressed.",
"It varies much both in form and color.",
"I listened.",
"Breakfast, that morning, had a rare charm about it for me.",
"Nothing in the condition, circumstances, or habits of the men, that can affect their health, must be allowed to escape the notice of these medical officers.",
"The consequence has been a great improvement in the condition and habits of the men.",
"The point of remark is, that all of these depend for their interest upon a human association.",
"The habits of this dog deserve a brief mention.",
"Several of the guests moved after us, as we passed into the gallery.",
"The remark excited general attention.",
"We were left alone in the gallery.",
"The larger gallery was crowded.",
"I had leave to copy a picture in his gallery.",
"Silence, darkness, still.",
"We all landed at once.",
"No, it is the poet, who loves them as his own shadow in the air, and lets them stand.",
"And next, the desire to bring back charm to an old art prompted their effort.",
"The advice has wider application.",
"In such a democratic world the newly adopted habits of the wealthy will not prove widely convincing.",
"A moment later the great ship was in darkness.",
"Quickly he threw off his coat and kicked off his shoes.",
"An officer approached him.",
"They did so and the little boat moved on in the darkness.",
"He looked at it closely in the half darkness and a smile passed over his face.",
"He listened at the door but could hear no sound.",
"What shall I tell her when next she rings the telephone?",
"The manager approached.",
"I listened but heard nothing.",
"I listened again and still heard nothing.",
"Darkness, silence everywhere.",
"Yet not quite absolute darkness.",
"And I had failed to respond to the hint he had given me.",
"Yet, if they let this point slip, where should I be?",
"I had never taken the trouble to measure my words and the whole truth being impossible, I necessarily must make a slip now and then.",
"I kept my face in shadow.",
"It is not the only proof we have of his intention to leave the city for a while.",
"Only one of them showed a simple emotion, and that one was, without any possibility of doubt, the cook.",
"But this calm, quiet questioning of fact took him by surprise.",
"I could make nothing out of it, could not connect it with what I myself knew of the confused experiences of that night.",
"Had the voice issued from this isolated point of darkness?",
"This necessarily caused a break in the proceedings.",
"He knew what it meant to freeze.",
"Again and again he went close to that tent, and listened.",
"In a moment he dropped that, and approached the tent.",
"They would hunt him down, and beat him when they found him.",
"A dozen times he had sat in rings like this, waiting for the final moment.",
"The chief thing is that she is going to marry me in the spring.",
"He began to hunt in the face of the wind, traveling toward the burned plain.",
"She had no desire to hunt.",
"Both listened.",
"Half way home they fought to see which one should marry the woman.",
"When he had eaten enough so that he could just barely slip out, he stopped eating.",
"The people were curious to know how she had so quickly acquired a fortune.",
"Fortune changed with the man.",
"She saw him, and told her father she would marry him.",
"In the night he took away the cow.",
"The next morning he demanded his cow.",
"He approached.",
"They took one of the rings of the dead man and went on their way.",
"There was little time for reflection.",
"He wondered, was grateful, yet he grew more confused and afraid.",
"His alarm increased.",
"The group opened a little as we approached, and in a moment we were before her.",
"As he reached the edge of the camp, he emerged from the shadow of the trees, and I started as I looked at him.",
"He listened without a word till I had finished.",
"No wonder I had been unable to see them in the darkness.",
"But the charm appeared to fail of its effect.",
"He felt that sense of emotion which makes one wish to be alone and think alone.",
"One flies from the houses, only to find a scene more horrible in the fields.",
"He was too tired now to walk much farther, and the sun was getting low, so that all the ground was in shadow.",
"He went on a little way looking for some nice shelter where he could pass the night, but could not find one.",
"He started up and listened.",
"I listened again.",
"We listened, but the sound was not repeated.",
"She said that she had been to several plays and concerts, but did not care for life in town.",
"I made no remark.",
"The woman had not arrested our progress or raised an alarm, after all.",
"In return she pressed mine.",
"But darkness came on quickly, and yet we still pushed forward.",
"I for my part do not believe that such was his intention from the first.",
"So they went on standing out to sea till they found it all broken up with the storm, with enormous waves and darkness.",
"This they did, and, putting about to the land, the wind increased so much that they were afraid of not finding a river in which to shelter, and of being lost.",
"On our way back we saw many people, of various descriptions, fishing in the river.",
"We landed in the boats, and found they were waiting for us, all loaded with provisions, and they gave us enough to make a very good breakfast, according to their ideas of dishes.",
"So the international gesture has, I think, begun already to succeed.",
"This speech made him open his big brown eyes a bit wider!",
"Like flies we must die.",
"We pressed on along a narrow road, but it was late afternoon, and the light was failing.",
"Her voice answered from the darkness in front of me.",
"Before he perceived my intention, I had picked it up, and almost at the same moment his hand fell on my arm.",
"But my uncle did not laugh again.",
"My father caught it out almost before it landed.",
"What had my uncle to do in this affair?",
"Still, I opened the other window, looked out and listened, but heard or saw nothing or no one.",
"He seemed to be listening for something, so I, who must have heard any unusual sound, listened too.",
"I want to slip in quietly.",
"He listened to their comments.",
"She had but to speak the words, and her father was restored to comfort, and the boy raised to fortune.",
"I shall be so glad to introduce them to their uncle.",
"Our uncle is a dear, good, kind man, and I love him.",
"He could hardly speak for emotion and the tears which were ready to start.",
"He explained to his uncle that he had gone in to pass his examination, and failed.",
"His habits were those of a student.",
"Can any man put off these bad habits in a moment, as he puts off his coat?",
"Are not they enough to possess?",
"Happy for him, when he begins to fail, to see round him attached hearts, and grateful faces, hands ready to tend him, as he has tended others.",
"After some time, gathering together a number of rich gifts, he started, in company with his mother, to visit his uncle.",
"Even my mother, her own sister, does not correspond with her.",
"All that worries her is to keep alive until she can decide who to leave her money to.",
"The gesture surprised them all.",
"But she said she could not marry a poor man and would therefore wait for me to make a fortune.",
"Then I might be sure she would marry me.",
"One cannot always make a fortune in a short time.",
"How the paper grows less and less!",
"What a reflection!",
"The celebration was a great success.",
"If he were to pick a fight with this bunch, he would be sold alongside his friend.",
"The surprise created a panic among the people.",
"They carried with them the seed of disease and death.",
"So the government advisers suggested a compromise.",
"This was a season of grateful rest to her.",
"To each of the class she gave each week a slip of paper containing one question.",
"I did never think to marry.",
"But that she could not frame her mouth to such large speeches as her sisters had done, or promise to love nothing else in the world.",
"No doubt it was a very affecting meeting between my father and my uncle.",
"My uncle promised to buy me another book, but he never remembered it.",
"The speaker finished his remark with a short laugh.",
"We marry and we give in marriage, but it is not loving.",
"She was about to turn round when she caught sight of her own face in the mirror, and that which she saw there made her change her intention.",
"Rather let them all die like flies than that.",
"There is no medium emotion.",
"He was the sort of man to come into a room without any remark.",
"Her first remark was characteristic, as first and last remarks usually are.",
"The sounds approached.",
"He turned over slowly and rolled to the bottom of the stairs.",
"I myself have seen her under the influence of sudden panic.",
"It grows as we grow.",
"What a mountain drops!",
"They have landed!",
"The girl turned to him with a gesture of surprise.",
"They stayed a long time, no one caring about that.",
"Now, after the centuries have come and gone, both church and people through long custom are willing to have it so.",
"So he had time for sharing in a good deal of the celebration.",
"All listened.",
"If he only knew where she lived, he might make sure at least of shelter.",
"This will be seen by the accompanying cuts.",
"When they were all in, the man gave the net a twist, so as to prevent them getting back.",
"He, however, would follow in their wake, and as they could not, for a great length of time, continue at their speed, they were at last forced to seek shelter in the trees.",
"The seed is in no danger from being injured by any other plant.",
"One is required for each cow.",
"The known habits of the person.",
"Here is a little poem I sent a short time since to a committee for a certain celebration.",
"He is placed alongside of them in our imagination, not behind them or in them.",
"And the result bears out this remark.",
"The blame is not with the seed, but with the soil.",
"When the uncle had reached the house, he insisted on taking off his coat alone in order to prevent the things from being hurt.",
"This did not worry her further, so she ran towards the uncle.",
"Uncle is here today, and as he has to leave early tomorrow morning, I have to talk to him tonight.",
"He approached his mother with a large sheet of paper.",
"Even with his intention to get rid of the talk he had acted against her command.",
"I understand quite well that she worries night and day about the state things are in at the castle.",
"It was her intention, naturally, to put everything into the usual order in the house.",
"His master knew no one here and had no intention of meeting anyone.",
"The uncle, taking his hand, wanted to lead him away, but he fought against it.",
"We have to do everything he says, unless our uncle should call us.",
"He said that he had been there, too, and he knows that our uncle is old and ill and is living all by himself.",
"She is going to live with her uncle at the castle in a very few days.",
"The scheme worked to a charm.",
"I remember one man applying who said he never had set any type, but he had a good theoretical knowledge of the business.",
"There are no tales of this war more fascinating than those that have been told by these men.",
"For a short time every other man seemed to fall, but the attack was pressed even closer and closer.",
"On such occasions I often looked round in alarm.",
"He seemed to have set all his hopes on the child that was coming, and as he looked deeper into the future the dark shadow that had come over his face seemed to die gradually away.",
"She jumped up and ran to the door and listened, but there was no sound.",
"Let the lucky man take the lot and trade with it a bit, and then come home and marry her.",
"She had chosen her position with knowledge and intention, for there was no room for anyone to stand beside her.",
"I kept my eyes fixed through the darkness on the old woman.",
"I knew that if I could gain this road I would be safe, but in the darkness I could not see any sign of it, so, in blind hope of striking it, I ran on.",
"We approached.",
"A little later, he was advised to marry again, and he yielded.",
"When he went to war, and when he went to hunt, men were to be ready for his service.",
"The darkness of night brought no rest.",
"The changes of her fortune are equally remarkable.",
"But unless they change their minds and their habits, it is not easy to see how they are to get near enough to us to carry on their study.",
"They lay down rules for life, and if they be asked what makes such a life worth living they are without any hint of an answer.",
"The world has in it evil enough, and darkness enough.",
"Our soldiers in the field are not depressed.",
"A wider and greater opportunity is on its way to us.",
"We hate the language of emotion.",
"Once only he makes a slip.",
"My life flies away like a dream!",
"This custom was since then observed in all similar cases to our own day.",
"The matter of the gold rings is as follows.",
"They had no intention of carrying out any of these unions, but were acting a part in view of the needs of the existing situation.",
"By his mere approach, he threw them into a panic and drove them from the land without a conflict.",
"Moreover, the standards and definitions could have only a certain theoretical value, as there never has existed a body that could speak in the name of all.",
"This is exactly the position in which the twins found themselves.",
"In every other direction I seemed to be looking not merely upon a black or almost black sky, but into close surrounding darkness.",
"On seeing me he started as with intense surprise and not a little alarm, and turned to run.",
"And after all, her mind is not a deeper darkness to me than his.",
"Only permit me this remark.",
"It is impossible to take away what they do not possess.",
"Some of the company have already sought shelter there, and I make a rush there with the same hope.",
"I wish to emphasize this point over and over again.",
"She was aware through closed eyes when darkness fell.",
"He listened for war talk, and heard none.",
"Searching in the car, he found a leather belt.",
"He listened, turning his ear to the wind.",
"A small dark group of men, silent and somehow impressive, stood off a little in the shadow.",
"His voice seemed low and full of emotion.",
"And it was panic alone that held her back.",
"She could never marry.",
"She pressed a hand hard on her heart as if to hold it still.",
"It was pressed to his breast very closely.",
"Each man drew forth a slip of paper and wrote upon it.",
"She followed him there, and as he closed the door she answered his questioning look by running into his arms and hiding her face.",
"It was he who talked and she who listened.",
"I feel that it grows tired.",
"It grows harder to get a chance to write and harder for me to express myself.",
"The shadow left his face.",
"I merely throw out the hint for what it is worth.",
"I am grateful that I have had much of this in my life.",
"We picked it up in a great panic, but it had not even altered its rate, as we found by later observations.",
"All was darkness.",
"It was really perfect darkness in some of the places, and we had to feel our way.",
"Never was a man listened to with so much attention.",
"I laughed, my whole mental mood changed by this remark.",
"They pooled, and made him their agent.",
"He got along all right with the uncle, and was invited to visit him, but the girl was not so easy.",
"He cares not much for me, perhaps, yet enough so that I possess some power over him.",
"The darkness, perhaps, and silence, convinced the fellow that she had already retired.",
"The difficulty is going to lie in convincing the crew of their safety.",
"The alarm was sounded none too soon.",
"They announced their intention of taking a little look around.",
"While all this talk was going on, the man had of course listened.",
"I saw them, thick as flies, while I was there last week.",
"It offered shelter and rest and protection.",
"Or had they merely such a hint as would lead them as close as this?",
"There a horse would find water, shelter, and grass.",
"A dozen times he was prepared to see her slip and fall.",
"The other men, drawn close, watched and listened, their eyes alive with many lights.",
"His other hand was pressed to his side.",
"For that, too, he was grateful.",
"But it is also necessary that the principle of all things should possess the highest, and all, power.",
"A little touch, a hint, a word, and I should have known what use to put them to.",
"They wanted to stay up and watch the water in the bottle freeze.",
"He did not want to slip and fall.",
"Many a good business man carries a heavy mortgage and pays well too, but of course it cannot stand financial strain or stress like the business which is clear of debt.",
"Long he sat, watching it, while the sounds outside in the street grew less and less, and at last when he went to the window, he found the street in darkness and in silence.",
"A few days later it was told that he had kicked the teacher.",
"If they were they would not marry.",
"Why did no one want to give her board and shelter?",
"Who listened or noticed?",
"The gesture was familiar.",
"But their days of darkness were not yet over.",
"I have observed and listened, but I have held my peace.",
"Still I kept quiet till he walked up to me and kicked at me.",
"He laid my head on the log and pressed one hand on my struggling body.",
"The girl pulled a little watch from her belt.",
"He was bringing it home, when one of the little seed boxes fell out.",
"He always listened till he heard it drop, then he ran down and brought it back and pushed it through again.",
"He knew just who were left in the house, for he had once supplied them with milk, and knew all about their family.",
"Wood, spreading out his hard, brown hands, as he sat down at the table.",
"The rest followed him in single file, going pretty slow, so as to enable us to keep up to them.",
"I could never have believed, if I had not seen it with my own eyes, that an animal could get so thin as that cow was.",
"I sat and listened to their talk, and it seemed to me that I was hearing the description of a great battle.",
"Come and see the cow stable.",
"There are not enough of them to catch the flies.",
"The flies were nearly eating him up.",
"Summer time, and flies bad.",
"Flies awful.",
"I have very few worries.",
"That is, if one assumes that he has worked out a perfectly clear idea of what a democracy means and what the normal means.",
"The individual, if a female, presents to a greater or less extent the external habits and character of the other sex.",
"It varies from day to day, year to year, depending upon the influences that have been brought to bear upon it.",
"They marry to find a home, without the object of establishing sexual relations.",
"We possess a number of good pictures and descriptions of him, as he was really a contemporary, and would probably be alive today if he had been put in a hospital for proper treatment instead of in prison.",
"As they approached, the man in the camp turned and saw them.",
"Will took advantage of the darkness to get a new roll of films in his camera.",
"There was no further alarm.",
"Quickly covering the pack he pulled the trigger.",
"Fortune was certainly with him that day.",
"Now wait till I dig out some of that dry wood from the inside.",
"Will very carefully placed his camera with its accompanying case of films.",
"There was no alarm that night, for which one and all felt grateful.",
"She made no reply till they were screened from observation.",
"Such a course would do their own country good, and, if successful, would be most grateful to the rest of the world.",
"What are the tales the mother tells?",
"Fortune helps them that help themselves.",
"Tell no tales out of school.",
"Can we remove the darkness from the night?",
"I listened and heard a sound far off like a water fall.",
"He ran around to her and together they began to dig in the snow and dead leaves.",
"As he spoke he drew something from under the shadow of the rock that settled the question immediately.",
"Go in the path of fortune.",
"The others, as though it had been a point of custom, ignored him.",
"Nobody had ever praised him to his face.",
"He watched and listened, then quickly drew in his head.",
"But here I am analyzing them before they had learned they had any self to analyze.",
"From the group of boys in the gallery he had looked down at her and wondered.",
"What was the last remark?",
"His brothers listened with much interest.",
"A cry of alarm followed, but whether he hit anybody or not he could not till.",
"He could think of no other remark to make.",
"The boys stood still and listened.",
"He read the slip inside.",
"They can keep the fortune.",
"That they were times of darkness, and therefore it was that the people who sat in great darkness, and in the valley of the shadow of death, were allowed to see a great light.",
"The custom was not kept up as it is here.",
"I rolled away and tried to get to my gun that had fallen on the ground.",
"As he spoke, there was a quality in his voice that seemed to find the boys in the darkness and point each of them out.",
"In the morning, as like as not, the boys would have to dig their way out.",
"For there was now hardly any shelter.",
"He looked back over his shoulder in alarm.",
"The eye of his uncle was like the eye of a crowd.",
"It was the first sign of emotion he had shown since his arrest.",
"Those memories built up a panic.",
"He forgot even that emotion now in wonder at what was happening.",
"Before him the circle split and rolled back.",
"If we have had the good fortune to win such a friend, let us do anything rather than lose him.",
"First the rain fell with a few drops, then it came down in sheets.",
"The mother made an angry gesture, as if to say that she could not help it.",
"This remark gave him a fresh idea.",
"Well, it is of no use my questioning myself.",
"She recognized the doctor, and made a gesture of regret.",
"The child grows, the child becomes a man.",
"He was looking at her with deep emotion.",
"And carrying her child in her arms she insisted on accompanying her sister and their friend to the first floor.",
"But, if he was to marry, some employment must first be found for him.",
"If the rain should fall, they would manage to find shelter somewhere.",
"Indeed, her husband must have already received a large sum to enable him to make good certain losses and expenses which he had hidden from her.",
"He dead, it would be all over, he would never possess the works.",
"He would be dead and he would never possess the works.",
"Then, on reaching the gallery where the darkness was complete, he affected anger in the most natural manner possible.",
"He had grown up in a kind of dream, full of a desire which he could not put into words, ever seeking the unknown, something which he knew not, did not possess.",
"They listened with breaking hearts.",
"For what nation has ever admitted an intention or desire to make aggressive war?",
"Our fortune says we must do what we may.",
"Yes, marry, will I.",
"Will no man marry me?",
"Now, fortune, help or never.",
"The coming darkness?",
"Of its proceedings no official journal was kept.",
"Its workers were removed from the shops, the theaters, the libraries, and good schools.",
"I have never seen a more beautiful, wild, and imposing landscape.",
"He could not see the expression of her eyes, which were in deep shadow, and she left him wondering whether she had understood or not.",
"He was not given to a display of emotion.",
"His face, beneath the shadow of his wide hat, was still and hard.",
"They are hard pressed.",
"Below them was darkness.",
"He therefore pressed his horse.",
"He listened for some time.",
"There was no sign of present anxiety or of great emotion.",
"He was a man of quick gesture and slow precise speech.",
"As they approached the hills, they found themselves in a more broken country.",
"The woman pressed upon them some of her small store of coffee and some new bread.",
"We can hardly connect them with more awful responsibilities.",
"It may give them a hint how to make much of others.",
"He does not like to be kicked.",
"This passage calls for some remark.",
"But this was a slip of memory.",
"They have no concerts.",
"But I have found out how to pay them, and to make my own fortune.",
"The expense of these buildings must have been considerable, but, as the construction of the vast machines they shelter was more so, it may be good economy.",
"Of course this statement does not include persons of large fortune, but it does include very many whose rank in society would make such a mode of life quite impossible with us.",
"Then caught flies.",
"It appears, therefore, that whatever has been done, was done by means which every man knows how to use, if fortune is kind enough to put them in his power.",
"He appears to have been not much qualified for the improvement of his fortune.",
"If soldiers are necessary, they must necessarily be supported, and it appears, upon reflection, that their pay will not support them by any other method.",
"Ought we not to catch the alarm while it is possible to make preparation against the danger?",
"It was seen to be a false alarm.",
"The price varies in other places according to circumstances.",
"If there be a wrong twist it may be set right.",
"There might be a handle for reflection.",
"There was much truth and knowledge of human nature in this remark.",
"I am now grown somewhat easier in my body, but my mind is sometimes depressed.",
"My father was deeply depressed.",
"One surprised dig and all was lost.",
"The criminal had never been able to advance the shadow of a reason or excuse for his mad act.",
"Precisely what emotion this knowledge left with her I have never known.",
"I pressed the spring that brought the face to my eyes, knowing it would not be her face.",
"And it was, indeed, my good fortune never to see her again.",
"Under the darkness I reached my one good hand up and took my own picture from its place.",
"Snow, as the shadow of the coming event fell upon her.",
"A slight shadow passed over her face, leaving it very cold and quiet.",
"Our crew varies a good deal.",
"These works had not the good fortune to become popular.",
"His principles, his habits, his very character, what do we know of them?",
"His fortune was of but little moment.",
"His master knew of these facts, and he took the alarm.",
"He had approached within a very few feet of them, supporting a lady on each arm.",
"That he ought to make his fortune.",
"With his comfortable fortune and good connections, the future seemed bright and possible enough as to circumstances.",
"How black it grows!",
"He had not listened to the voice within.",
"He spends his whole life and time about the poor, I hear.",
"If he would not listen to me, I should let the cow go for the simple reason that the matter is beyond my ability.",
"The depressed classes problem is a vital part of the cause.",
"Emotion there is in the movement.",
"A man without emotion is a man without feeling.",
"Finding myself entirely alone in the gallery, I cut that picture from its frame.",
"Tell me, whom did he marry?",
"I was thinking of stopping work in order to eat my dinner, which I had with me, when a party of officers approached me on their way to a little hill in the field.",
"Still deeper was his emotion on visiting again the home of former days.",
"I am often cast down, and have to sit in silence and darkness.",
"Notice had been given of our intention to be present, and the company was consequently larger than usual.",
"We were informed that it was the custom of the place not to attend any appointed meeting till an hour after the time named.",
"It was not without emotion that he visited once more the place which had been so familiar to him in earlier days.",
"My uncle made promises and never kept them.",
"She was carried suddenly away upon a wave of the emotion which she herself had created.",
"It told its own story beyond any shadow of a mistake.",
"He cut the string and looked at a few of the sheets.",
"He approached them without a word.",
"The doors rolled open before them.",
"There was no place to which he could fly, no shelter save on the other side of the life which he had just begun to love.",
"His physical condition began to alarm him.",
"Even their shadow cannot trouble us any longer.",
"I have only one emotion left.",
"She listened for a moment longer.",
"Then, in the late fall and early winter, we had sufficient rain to start the feed on our ranges and hope in our hearts.",
"Upon this particular afternoon we had listened to a new tale of disaster.",
"Finally I felt so sorry for the girl, that I made up my mind to give her a hint, so that she could slip quietly away.",
"Was I grateful?",
"His figure was imposing.",
"Some of them told me it was easier to marry money than to make it.",
"How wide they opened when he listened to our story!",
"He could not twist his tongue to lie about himself.",
"He, too, was accompanying the body.",
"And directly they approached, he spoke.",
"And before leaving he made, what I will term, a remarkable remark.",
"Even in the darkness I believe I can find my way.",
"There was a brief, questioning silence.",
"It has to me a charm for which I can hardly account.",
"Then we gave up trying to catch my shadow.",
"As the day of competition approached, it did not seem possible that the event was so near at hand, but it came.",
"I threw myself upon the bed, and, closing my eyes, forgot my good intention.",
"They were like twins, though they were not brothers.",
"Like all folk tales they mirror the child life of the world.",
"He walked to the door, apparently with the intention of leaving her.",
"Bright followed in one of the most powerful of his speeches, followed by others not less striking.",
"Must have cost a small fortune.",
"As they approached it the figure came out of it and towards them.",
"He shall marry with the highest.",
"She declined the paper with a gesture of her white hand.",
"They landed and walked up to the house.",
"He pressed her to him.",
"The mortgage!",
"And he pressed her arm and looked into her face with a confident smile.",
"Then, suddenly, she saw a tall figure standing in the shadow of the trees.",
"One thing I would not let slip.",
"She had listened, understood, and kept his words.",
"Years rolled by.",
"And years rolled by.",
"Time pressed.",
"The soldiers listened in silence.",
"An official minute was given to him, recording his appointment, as well as certain details with which he asked to be supplied.",
"What did his uncle matter to him?",
"He disappeared in the darkness.",
"A few drops of rain were falling.",
"The darkness was such that we could not distinguish the numbers on the houses.",
"She offered me a place by her side, but time pressed.",
"The smoke rolled away from the end of the street.",
"And time pressed!",
"The sheets were dirty.",
"Enter him in the prison register!",
"One was grateful, the other was not.",
"What was coming out of this thick darkness?",
"People were coming and going, stopping, questioning one another, running.",
"I pressed his hand.",
"There could only be heard in this thick darkness the sound of a measured and firm step dying away in the distance.",
"And I pressed his hand.",
"It was the fortune of this war.",
"By degrees he became quiet and listened.",
"There was no shelter near enough for them to reach it, and it was too dark to travel.",
"He sat with her and talked more than had been his custom.",
"Years seemed to have rolled away, and once more the father felt the soft, warm arms of his baby about his neck.",
"What may the meaning of these speeches be?",
"I now repeat and emphasize that statement.",
"The reason for the hunt was now plain enough.",
"Can we rest and not freeze?",
"Of course no one has ever seen these rings with the physical eye.",
"Then comes the question of intention.",
"He ate little, and left the place depressed.",
"The darkness is here, and my time has come.",
"A few moments later there is in the same place the passage of shadow.",
"It was a reflection, in a sense, on each of them.",
"She will in time show her blood, who ever may marry her.",
"I pressed him again and again, but he could not answer.",
"Another was a man of position without character, whose evil habits destroyed the talent that would have made him famous.",
"Whether he liked it or not I am unable to say, but he seemed to take an interest in the proceedings.",
"We turned down this quiet road, and came alongside a beautiful little garden covered with flowers of all kinds.",
"I knew what he was in a moment, although I had never seen such a thing before, and knew I had to hunt him.",
"I told them I looked for no thanks, but was grateful, nevertheless.",
"I made no remark, and the man was removed to the cells.",
"And immediately he who counted took out a slip of paper and marked something down upon it.",
"Nor did he know what she replied to him, only that she would marry him.",
"I came forth from darkness into the world, and again I leave the world and return to darkness.",
"He was too full of emotion to speak.",
"Their expenses were probably paid in advance, and they had made a kind of individual celebration of the trip.",
"As they took a roll, they landed nearly at the inner edge of the walk.",
"That amount seemed a small fortune to him.",
"The alarm had spread to the settlement of houses near by.",
"This man kicked the door shut behind him.",
"The manager turned aside to hide his emotion.",
"He said the letter told about a secret, about a fortune the writer had discovered.",
"It was some one else who kicked my dog away.",
"I hunt.",
"I was careful to make no sound and to keep well in the shadow.",
"The child had shown so slight an interest in anything in my book except the pictures that I did not yet connect her singing with it.",
"The child approached her teacher on the subject.",
"Her uncle did not at once reply.",
"In our wider efforts this is true.",
"It was plain enough that my intention was to help them to escape.",
"She made a gesture.",
"But he did not carry out his intention.",
"The girl flying in a panic had forgotten it till too late.",
"She turned and led the way into the darkness.",
"I meant to slip away, but this man caught me.",
"Against the back of his neck something cold pressed.",
"I can take a hint without waiting for a church to fall on me.",
"Darkness fell early.",
"It had little shelter from the storm, and there was no evidence of fair weather at hand.",
"I was holding my breath, with my hand pressed over my heart to feel how it was beating, when the door opened suddenly, and I heard a voice speaking.",
"And we both listened.",
"And all men who enter this condition surprise themselves by the quantity of knowledge and the extent of insight they possess.",
"And when it does we shall know that the fortune is close by, and waiting to be found.",
"It grows by itself.",
"They created me, and gave me the powers I possess.",
"It was a treat that she was grateful for.",
"The shadow itself is anything but lost.",
"The hint was understood.",
"Its body almost pressed the sand.",
"None of the others would be grateful to him.",
"I have listened to too much of it.",
"I smell panic in the air.",
"The inner room was in darkness.",
"Chance and blind custom are not enough for me.",
"What can be supplied?",
"They let her wear rings.",
"It was his intention to be a case.",
"He hoped that he would not see her, and he listened for her voice.",
"He approached her.",
"I could never marry just anybody.",
"She was proof against any shadow.",
"But when she passed the mirror in an insurance office window, she saw her reflection and at its appearance she felt surprise and pleasure.",
"They all listened.",
"The whole boat was in alarm.",
"A shadow hung over all the family group.",
"He faced his visitors without emotion.",
"He made no reply to this and after reflection she tried again.",
"Panic was at once written on the faces of the former officers.",
"To them the defense was absolutely convincing.",
"It was in this depressed state of mind that she came to the top of the stairs.",
"The major listened to his father with pain and wonder.",
"It is certain none of our people have left the house to do it, since the alarm was first given.",
"It was some little time, even, before he could recover from his alarm, and then he let himself be known by his answer.",
"This last remark was altogether just.",
"Nevertheless, twice the time necessary to bring things to issue had gone by, and neither signal, shot, nor alarm had reached his ears.",
"Her emotion was not only too obvious, it was too deep for their understanding.",
"A shadow seemed suddenly to come between me and the sun.",
"He approached her and called her by name.",
"She showed no signs of emotion.",
"I have studied the growth of this tree by its rings, and it is curious.",
"She approached the lady and wanted to say something, but nothing came out.",
"It always seemed as if a great joy came into her voice and as if she wanted to make this joy appeal to all who listened.",
"She rolled it under the window so that she might look for a moment into the room.",
"It had a twist in its nature which would not allow it to run straight.",
"There is a charm in rooms which can be felt but not described.",
"The girl settled the last of her flowers and pushed back her hair with a worried gesture.",
"But it is true that certain states of mind and certain conditions of matter always correspond.",
"But it varies so.",
"Was it possible that she had actually missed the point of his remark?",
"He saw her pure profile, then the full charm of her changing face.",
"I am going to ask her to marry me.",
"Then when he came and we thought he was so rich she made me marry him.",
"And I think that at last he suspected that she had made me marry him for his money.",
"Gradually the panic fear died down.",
"It stood black in the shadow of its trees.",
"The poor lady whom my friend was to marry was found dead in her bed.",
"The panic died.",
"He has owned these securities for many years.",
"She was too beautiful and his emotion was too deep.",
"He drew the card out of its envelope as he spoke and laid it beside the entry in the register.",
"Economic influence on boundary lines.",
"Ethnic influence on boundary lines.",
"Historic influence on boundary lines.",
"This was to be the base of supplies from which my friend and I were to hunt in different directions.",
"It surely seemed as if fortune was with me that day, as at last I had a fair chance at the game I had come so far to seek.",
"It was just drawing back when I pressed the trigger.",
"He was greatly depressed, and seemed to give way completely, frequently saying that he never expected to see his home again.",
"I fired a second time, and rolled him over for good and all.",
"I watched them until darkness came on, and all this while they fed slowly back toward the mountains on which my friend had been hunting the week before.",
"In the afternoon my man and I took our first hunt.",
"I did not hunt for them, for I did not want them in that condition.",
"I do not see why our wind did not alarm him.",
"I rolled off my horse and loaded my gun.",
"Our animal fortune seemed to us so enormous that it never could be spent.",
"In this district their habits have been greatly modified.",
"To promote inquiry into, and to record observations on, the habits and natural history of the various wild animals.",
"In a man of his age and habits this seemed very possible.",
"The crowd listened in dead silence.",
"Never had he known what such darkness was.",
"Here for a while a shadow seemed to fall over our trip.",
"Sound the alarm!",
"That which I myself would give my fortune for I can never have.",
"His cap had rolled off, and it took him a long time to find it.",
"He took off his cap and approached her.",
"He explained how the property and the funds that would thus come into their hands could be so managed as to leave a fortune in the pocket of each of them before they should have done with the estate.",
"He flew around the curve like a shadow.",
"In the darkness back of him he heard a noise.",
"He had taken the wrong direction when he entered the gallery, that was all.",
"Without it he would have been long ago in the power of darkness.",
"He was in total darkness.",
"From this time forth he would be in darkness.",
"The heading seemed to have grown suddenly wider.",
"It seemed very real to him, so real that he wondered if he was still lying there in the darkness.",
"The darkness about him held no human being save himself, but the vision was just as real to him, and the coming was just as welcome as though it had all been true.",
"He stood for a moment then, questioning with himself.",
"The darkness that lay upon the earth seemed, also, to lie heavily on her spirit.",
"Landed and traded interest compared.",
"He acknowledged the justice of the remark.",
"But perhaps some generations may pass before the want is supplied.",
"One of his arguments against drinking, appears to me not convincing.",
"The table was well supplied, except that the fruit was bad.",
"I cannot find that she received this additional fortune.",
"Do not make them speeches.",
"It had never been the custom in the family.",
"The emotion had not altogether died out of his voice and face.",
"The number of distinct bones varies at different periods of life.",
"But as it grows up, long and patient education of its voluntary muscles is needed to achieve walking, writing, use of musical instruments, and many other acts of daily life.",
"No other animal naturally assumes it or is able to keep it long.",
"Hence the common custom of eating meat with bread and vegetables is a sound one.",
"This varies but slightly in health.",
"An infant whose main business it is to grow spends the greater part of its time in sound sleep.",
"As we all know, the sense of touch varies in different parts of the skin.",
"Remember that this treatment for broken bones is only to enable the patient to be moved without further injury.",
"Make on a slip of paper a note of his directions.",
"This is an effective means of preventing any mistakes, especially in the night.",
"A plant or animal that grows or lives on another.",
"But the loss of custom first opened his eyes to his real situation.",
"She drew him to her with sudden emotion, for these days had been very hard for her.",
"Our childhood grows in value as we grow in years.",
"At last the charm began to work.",
"But after he had completely recovered, he refused to hunt.",
"The shadow of the trees fell on the earth.",
"The garden supplied her with vegetables.",
"The cow fell into the river, and was washed away.",
"So he stuck his knife into the cow and drew blood.",
"She wonders he let it slip.",
"Will have her uncle sounded.",
"Their eyes, upon this hint, had the advantage of mine.",
"He hoped, he told me, that I would soon enable him to answer their wishes and his own.",
"But this is my confidence, that I shall have it in my power to marry when I will.",
"But that she chose not to take another step till she knew how she approved of her scheme to have her uncle sounded, and with what success, if tried, it would be attended.",
"He is but an uncle, is he?",
"This is still the burden of my song, I can marry her when I will.",
"She has not strength of mind sufficient, she says, to enable her to support her condition.",
"This I know, that were I to marry this lady, he would rather settle upon her all he has a mind to settle, than upon me.",
"He began to speak to tell her who he was, for her look was questioning.",
"We lay with our faces pressed against the cold ice for hours at a time, watching.",
"The twins were not in sight.",
"The twins!",
"The dog approached the girls.",
"It was surprising how she seemed to keep supplied with them.",
"When she had given it to him she had made an odd remark.",
"Let him the while possess it.",
"Where is it, uncle?",
"We cannot help it, uncle.",
"The worse, our fortune.",
"Away, good uncle, to the battle go!",
"Marry, indeed, they say she cannot speak.",
"Marry, with all my heart, and welcome too.",
"Marry, with all my heart.",
"It is a fortune.",
"But nobody seemed to understand his intention.",
"But there certainly are not so many men of large fortune in the world as there are pretty women to deserve them.",
"It was now his object to marry.",
"Lay everything before him, and tell him that in my work he can restore the fortune he has lost.",
"God be praised, however, I shall be able to drink my coffee out of this dish every morning during the rest of my days.",
"But as he was too poor to marry her, he never made love to her.",
"To possess her again, and die on her breast!",
"Her marriage, she thought, would connect them still more closely.",
"It was the terrible disease which he had spent the greater part of his fortune in fighting against.",
"My uncle does expect it, does he not?",
"So little revenue is mine of this land, that it becomes me to seek my fortune beyond the sea.",
"He marked the castle and its towers, which were both strong and fair, and much he praised the work.",

"I was counting on him to fix up this mortgage business!",
"He could not marry her.",
"I pressed him to write this story himself, but he refused.",
"He ought to have kicked me out.",
"Until, if ever, I give my heart again no man shall possess me.",
"He stepped forward, with that little slip of paper in his hand, and began to read from it.",
"There will probably be legal proceedings of some kind, and as the law takes no account of poverty, he is likely to go to the wall.",
"Or her connection with the dramatic mystery of her lost uncle?",
"I laid the newspaper down and fell into a train of reflection.",
"But the whole thing is full of charm.",
"I am not aware of the existence of any such custom.",

"She made me drink wine every day, listened to my conversation, and was pleased.",
"As he said this, he pressed a secret spring on the side of the box.",
"When the political issues grew broader, he was careful not to connect himself with any measure.",
"When we were first friends, I knew nothing of that darkness.",
"It was a simple story that his questioning drew forth.",
"Yet now, when the character is forming, and those habits, feelings, tastes are becoming developed and fixed, which are to go with him through life, he can look to his father neither for example nor counsel.",
"They were almost afraid to hope that the good fortune would continue.",
"But there need be no alarm.",
"And at its close there was a general feeling of grateful satisfaction.",
"He gave the alarm.",
"But only a shadow of him is found in his books.",
"And one by one the tales were told until the last was said.",
"The opening lines seem to hint at an experience somewhat distant.",
"A charm of proof.",
"But they can neither hunt, nor fish, nor row.",
"Now he pressed forward to the front.",
"Upon reflection, I shall not notice it.",
"These lie in deep shadow.",
"For that special reason he had resolved to possess it.",
"He has an eye and a tongue that would charm a woman into anything.",
"He feels most grateful to her.",
"I mean to make them hunt.",
"Her lawyer, too, taking notes of every look and gesture?",
"I have been forced to marry her.",
"Do they not ask pay at the twin celebration?",
"That was her idea of the way in which he was one day to make his fortune.",
"Their place would be supplied by no others.",
"They both listened, but heard nothing.",
"With that remark, he applied himself to putting up the bill just inside the bar window.",
"This answer, and his manner, and his black dress, and his coming back so quietly, and his announced intention of continuing to live abroad, explained it all.",
"Gesture is easier both to make and to understand than speech is.",
"The grass, at the time of our visit, was for the most part covered with sheets spread out to dry.",
"This was a more serious matter, so we explained that they were very beautiful, but that these things had a charm upon the spot which they would lose if removed elsewhere.",
"The darkness was absolute.",
"Rain was falling, and the darkness was intense.",
"It was partly covered in shadow, but he could see that it was a human figure.",
"The figure lay upon its back, its upper part in shadow, but standing above it and looking down upon the face, he saw that it was a dead body.",
"It had also moved its arms, for, look, they are both in the shadow!",
"Then I approached my mystery.",
"To those inside all was black darkness.",
"He stepped quickly into the shadow of a tree.",
"A moment later he drew a long breath, opened his eyes with an effort, made a single remark, and fell into a deep sleep.",
"The second writer, however, assumes a very different tone.",
"He was then allowed a shelter in the bank.",
"At first he was depressed at the thought of sitting still for so many hours with nothing to do, but he was not left to himself so much as he anticipated.",
"It was characteristic of him that often when he himself was most personally affected, the situation became an object of reflection.",
"The evening and the darkness drew on, and everything gradually became silent.",
"When pressed for an explanation he generally gave his health as an excuse.",
"I put my finger on the chart and announced that that was where we were.",
"Why, the language of the stars was mine, and I listened and heard them telling me my way over the deep.",
"Walls of darkness close in upon me, so that, when the last star is gone, the darkness is so near that it seems I can reach out and touch it on every side.",
"By the time we went about again, darkness had fallen.",
"It is the custom.",
"It is not at all likely, as far as one can judge from their titles, that any one of his lost works was devoted to the celebration of any such successful passion.",
"But as he went, the people pressed round him.",
"To be kind and grateful to cats and all other animals.",
"At last, after a great deal of questioning, the reason came out.",
"Just as they let their wealth slip out of their hands, so will their rule slip out of their hands.",
"Her uncle did not.",
"He is broken down in health, and I suspect he is broken down in fortune.",
"Some touch, some turn, I could not tell what or how, seemed all that was necessary to enable me to see and to hear him.",
"As he did so, his shadow turned and lay along the road in front of him as before.",
"Darkness and silence!",
"There was something of the same charm as in modern days is experienced in staying at a college.",
"By good fortune, too, it was a dead calm between my father and me.",
"I do nothing now, but try to possess my soul in peace, and continue to possess my body on any terms.",
"Whom did he marry?",
"Now I may almost say it consists with my knowledge that all this has not a shadow to rest upon.",
"My feeling would be to get it placed anywhere for as much as could be got for it, and rather in the shadow, till one saw the look of it in print.",
"Tell my fortune by my hand.",
"Makers of false rings.",
"Our fingers are too few, it seems, to twist together some poor covering for our bodies.",
"Every one of them had been rich, or his father, his brother or his uncle was still wealthy, or his father or he himself had had a very fine position.",
"I had not, in the least, anticipated that a chance remark would produce such an effect.",
"But possibly they are in such darkness that they do not consider this.",
"He has money, and he spends it for work.",
"The intention was that I should ask him to write, and I did so.",
"It is an old custom, they say, and part of their religion, and no woman could marry without it.",

["Some of the women, however, pretend to have the power of casting it, though if questioned how they accomplish it, they can return no answer.",
"She succeeded but too well.",
"Determined that they should understand it, I proposed that they themselves should translate it.",
"This gave me some notion of the number of the creatures, and I began to feel that the whole affair was becoming even more serious than I had imagined.",
"Soon, I heard several of the creatures outside.",
"When the smoke cleared, I saw that the room was empty, and the window free.",
"I could see, now, how the creatures had managed to reach the window.",
"This was, of itself, sufficient to show how huge an effort the creatures had made to break down the door, and how nearly they had succeeded.",
"They are wonderful creatures.",
"They always have patients in the hospital, and people in the apartments, which are much in demand.",

"But this, though supported by the nurse, did not quite satisfy me.",
"No trace of the missing lady could be discovered.",
"I have a special object in exploring.",
"A sigh of relief escaped him.",
"His explanations consumed but a few moments.",
"The sheep were the only animals on the island, although there were several sorts of birds.",
"How long this lasted I cannot tell.",
"I am sure the men must have felt the change, though certainly they were too far away to see it, for they shifted by ever so little from their first frozen attitude.",
"Nobody ever understood how he escaped.",
"It did not matter much, but I continued to do it by various shifts.",
"And they succeeded.",
"I knew what those sounds meant, for they had cost me fuel enough to have lasted a month.",
"In the first place, nobody would visit the spot, and if they did, our property would be perfectly protected by the law of the woods.",
"He was not more than a quarter of a mile from home, and cold as it was, he felt sure that he could swim that distance.",
"Crop knew what that meant.",
"We can almost trace its progress, and we feel that the time spent by us here is full of profit as well as pleasure.",
"When he came to my tree, he seemed to think that there might be something among its branches worth looking at.",
"By this time my performance must have lasted nearly half an hour.",
"But when the storm began to sound, I lost no time in pushing out into the woods to enjoy it.",
"As to the sheep evil, that can hardly become greater than it is at the present day.",
"So the matter blew over.",
"Dear creatures!",
"He started when I said this, and pressed his lips firmly together.",
"It was my turn now to lock the door.",
"He sat down with a sigh.",
"People still sigh, sometimes, even nowadays.",
"The moment she believed someone else took her place she relaxed her hold.",
"Of course, there are exceptions.",
"In a little while she heard a knock at her door.",
"After that whenever she came to that district, crowds would come to hear her speak.",
"Most of them are slaves.",
"The slaves sleep on the ground like animals.",
"Twice a day she held services and great crowds came to hear her.",
"Some were twins she had saved from death, some were the children of slaves.",
"I have cleared the path.",
"Then some of the lazy people of the village began to help, and at last the house was built.",
"But the people of that village were lazy, too.",
"The people of the village forgot to be lazy.",
"They were treated worse than slaves.",

"We are, as it were, cousins, with the mark of our common family strong on both of us.",
"It is not to be expected that they can express themselves fully in words that they have borrowed from the kitchen.",
"Our men fought like heroes.",
"The desire to believe on the part of some of his people was very touching.",
"Girls and women were made to carry heavy weights of coal.",
"The watch and chain could not be found, and there was but little doubt that they had been stolen.",
"Why do our athletes always win?",
"Discipline relaxed, teams did pretty much as they pleased, and the public remained away from the games.",
"In that record stands the story of the fight, with striking shifts from week to week.",
"Well, we must have the mystery cleared up.",
"He soon cleared away the snow from the entrance, and opening the door he came in.",
"The others succeeded in making their escape.",
"We were fortunate in the first run in getting good ground.",
"I knew that within a few minutes the troops would come up, and if they heard the firing they would come rapidly.",
"We had a severe fight of at least an hour, when we succeeded in driving the enemy.",
"I was somewhat disappointed, for, judging from our large business, I certainly had expected a greater sum.",
"Invite them to take more hair?",
"Did I sigh?",
"I love a sheep from the bottom of my heart.",
"But for his ruling passion he would have escaped.",
"She saw but little of her cousins.",
"His mother looked after him with a sigh.",
"He stopped suddenly and bit his lips in pain.",
"Then she turned away with a happy sigh.",
"Now he would have it from her lips as well.",
"Friendship was a beautiful thing!",
"He had rarely seen her resting.",
"The long sleep or the coffee had cleared his eyes.",
"Hour after hour the people stand there on the bank, waiting to see the barrier go down.",
"And still the barrier held.",
"Silence lasted for a while.",
"The need to know about people other than ourselves, and yet not too unlike, in circumstances other than our own, and yet not too strange, seems to be a necessary part of our education, and we interpret it in the light of our own personal conduct.",
"It is difficult to satisfy the interest in animals.",
"But the mystery was never cleared up.",
"In the early afternoon, however, the mystery was cleared up.",
"Almost at the sound of the release there came a knock at the door.",
"Then once more I disappeared into the woods.",
"When I told him he bit his lips.",
"The weather cleared in the evening, as it often does in a hill country.",
"I looked to see them bring dry fuel and light the pile again.",
"I will make the pile great for fire.",
"The other stood so close to her that the girl could not move without touching her.",
"She sat down at her little table, with a heavy sigh.",
"Then she gave a little sigh, and turned and listened again.",
"I wanted to know how he had been caught, and what he had been set to do, and how he had escaped.",
"While this lasted, it seemed to me that I had a dream.",
"No one has ever escaped.",
"He stood with a smile upon his lips, beating time with his hand to the music, watching the figure of the dance.",
"For they were terrible, these things that lived yet did not live, which were his slaves and moved at his will.",
"Close by me, at my side, at my feet, there was a sigh.",
"I did not understand the sigh.",
"What could I do less than put it to my lips?",
"See how its branches spread.",
"With his own hands he cleared away the grass and trees, put the place in good order, and made it pure and clean.",
"The hated cousins?",
"A smile came on his lips.",
"Thoughts were passing rapidly through his brain, and they brought a smile to his lips.",
"He took her hand and raised it to his lips.",
"He escaped and opened the door.",
"The existence of these people is forgotten even in the traditions of the oldest historical nations.",
"But it has acquired properties of which no trace existed in the original liquid.",
"He would as soon believe that a sheep was a plant.",
"The firing was still going on very near us, to the south, west, and east.",
"The drive lasted many hours.",
"The man that assumes those duties can attend to them alone.",
"The firing had stopped.",
"They had suddenly emerged in a cleared place.",
"They have found no trace of him.",
"But there all trace had been lost.",
"It is no wonder she receives no love or consideration from her husband or anybody else.",
"He was glad to see the light switched away.",
"No man could have appreciated the position of that girl on the hill.",
"And his lips set even harder than before.",
"But I may as well say here that I never really appreciated it.",
"How had she escaped?",
"He heard me out with a sigh of relief.",
"The city editor seemed to understand, for I was switched on to him a moment later.",
"It admits of some variation, even in the books, according as they are printed either in the upper or the lower part of this province.",
"The woods were cut down.",
"He borrowed some books out of the stores where books were sold.",
"Then they knew that it was not safe for them to stay in the woods any longer.",
"Their work is left for slaves and women.",
"The poor sheep had nobody to protect them.",
"She wanted some more sheep.",
"She meant to kill him as she had killed his sheep.",
"Now the sheep would have some peace.",
"From the dark woods he would come out suddenly.",
"When the battle was over, he would go back to the woods again.",
"As the night went on, the pile grew higher.",
"He knew all about living in the woods.",
"Some of them went into the woods and never came back.",
"He had to get his food by shooting animals in the woods.",
"They made slaves of their prisoners.",
"The friends of these slaves sometimes sent money to buy their freedom.",
"The ships tried to take the city by firing at it from the water.",
"The ships did their worst firing at night.",
"Here his chief study was the wild creatures of the woods.",
"He must live for years almost all of the time in the woods.",
"Often he had to travel on foot through woods where there were no roads.",
"After some days he took his gun, and went into the woods.",
"One day he was walking in the woods.",
"But he borrowed all the books he could get.",
"She made her dresses longer.",
"She worked at this as long as the war lasted.",
"She put some pretty dresses in the window to show how well she could do.",
"Other girls liked the little dresses that she made.",
"All of us had an invite.",
"And from other persons than specialists no more would be required.",
"Does he sing with his lips closed?",
"I answered him that it would be hard thus to treat our honest fellow creatures.",
"Small trees grew along the track and the light from the cars touched their branches.",
"He wanted something the woods could not give, and had begun to think life had more to offer than he had known.",
"For beautiful variety no crop can be compared with this.",
"Its leaves are still firmly attached, while those of other trees are falling around it.",
"Our position in this matter is in truth rather embarrassing.",
"A second time came the knock, but no more nerve of sound in it than at the first.",
"My words proved how well they had succeeded.",
"The spirit of service lying at the heart of the great national organizations made possible quick response to new duties immediately upon our entrance into the war.",
"So rapidly had she settled that not a man of her crew escaped.",
"They continued to swim toward the ship.",
"The man laid a finger to his lips.",
"Hill was a woman of weak character, and yet she stuck firmly to her story.",
"Hill passed his tongue over his dry lips before he was able to speak.",
"Hill appeared from the inner room in answer to his knock.",
"No evidence has been produced to show that anything has been stolen from the place.",
"He cleared out in the middle of the night after his wife had gone to bed.",
"Then she made up her mind firmly.",
"It would cause a shock to his many friends, and especially to those who knew what a close friendship had existed between the arrested man and the dead judge.",
"It was many years since a trial had created so much interest in legal circles.",
"Look at the number of branches the tree has!",
"She had escaped me to run upon what?",
"I want to lock that door.",
"What did such an innovation mean?",
"I had come very near to revealing my secret.",
"But the shock of this accident to my nurse has cleared my brain and made me capable again of attending to my own affairs.",
"She felt as though it had lasted an hour.",
"But I did not lock the door.",
"But everything cleared before me when she turned around again.",
"But I could no longer fix my mind on details, and much of this portion of his address escaped me.",
"When they left it again, the girl was with them and walked with her hand touching his head.",
"At the sound of her voice he relaxed.",
"But his lips were still drawn back.",
"The scene shifted.",
"This was fortunate for him.",
"For an hour she let him lie on the edge of her dress, with his nose touching her foot, while she worked on baby things.",
"The smoke cleared away.",
"Not a sound escaped her ears.",
"For a time after this second beating he could not have escaped had he been free.",
"On his return, the husband, not finding his wife, realized that she had been stolen.",
"Between them there existed a friendship.",
"Then he came to himself, went back to his own country, and rented a house.",
"He went on further until he met a sheep which kicked against a rock till evening to pass the night there.",
"He who had first stolen the money went away.",
"In his absence his mother killed a sheep.",
"It is a sheep that we have killed.",
"During the night he took away the sheep.",
"Next morning he demanded his sheep.",
"She opened her lips to speak.",
"They would knock it all to pieces.",
"Let me look at the lock.",
"If a lock went wrong, he would have it off at once and taken to pieces.",
"It had doors and windows, and several stories in it, only the upper stories did not rest on the lower, but upon higher branches of the tree.",
"His face cleared, and he looked at me with a little smile.",
"I walked up and down, but could find no trace of him.",
"He looked behind him and all around into the woods, and then urged his horse close to mine.",
"But it was only fancy, and, with a sigh, I turned away and went down through the hall.",
"Take her, my son, and raise up a race of heroes!",
"At length he died, whether of excess in meat or in drink is not agreed among historians.",
"At length, however, a deep sigh struck upon his ear.",
"Drawing water was a typical employment of slaves.",
"After all, to stimulate love and friendship there is nothing like a common enemy!",
"With a few brilliant exceptions they would collapse too.",
"If they had spread a little farther and lasted a little longer, who knows what might have happened?",
"They, too, were veterans.",
"These tracks lasted very well, but they required constant attention.",
"To be out of the firing line did not mean rest.",
"Some of the men had to swim the river.",
"But life is beginning to come back to their eyes and their lips.",
"When they had both become recognized powers, neither appreciated the work of the other.",
"But never did his name pass her lips.",
"I bit my lips.",
"I noticed that her great brown eyes watched my lips and not my face.",
"No sound escaped her.",
"He was due back at his official duties, he said.",
"This he succeeded in doing.",
"He thus escaped this danger, but only to encounter another.",
"The plan completely succeeded.",
"He had cleared the way.",
"So long as this fear lasted, their union was strong.",
"Sweet creatures!",
"We were not doing a great deal of firing when I came, though we had always to be prepared to come suddenly and quickly into action, especially at night.",
"There was very heavy firing that morning, but less in the afternoon.",
"For a moment they seemed to have succeeded.",
"We succeeded, however, in getting a meal of sorts, and then went back to the train and turned in early.",
"A wet wind blew down the road.",
"Yet he showed never a trace of uncertainty.",
"I remember being interested at the time that my reputation lasted so well in my absence.",
"There was a silence while he raised his glass to his lips.",
"The lines about his mouth relaxed again.",
"I have succeeded so that there is not a man in town who would not be glad to see me on a yard arm.",
"A smile suddenly played about her lips.",
"A determined knock and ring came at the front door.",
"The motor was a private one, borrowed for the occasion.",
"Here he succeeded.",
"There was a knock at the door.",
"Nothing would satisfy him but that he, too, should go to the ground and examine it.",
"The enemy at the pass, however, when they saw those above defeated, took to flight.",
"A small number, nevertheless, escaped through the forest and crossed the river.",
"They shared the duties between them.",
"But what shall we say to that lost sheep?",
"Perhaps the old woman appreciated this more fully than anyone else.",
"They were really like cousins to him, by this time.",
"The cousins stopped short.",
"And the scheme has succeeded.",
"I do not like crowds any more.",
"Science has succeeded to poetry no less in the little walks of children than with men.",
"Really it is embarrassing.",
"I mean when he is pleased, for otherwise there is no judging.",
"They were gone, and the house was cleared out.",
"There is something very touching, too, in their manner and appearance.",
"He spoke without moving his lips.",
"If he ever got back home and tried to tell people, they would be sure to lock him up and throw away the key.",
"She was about to carry out this threat when there was a knock on the door.",
"For all his many emotions, his face only reflected one.",
"The duties on sugar were made equal.",
"Each chief had his station marked and his special duties assigned.",
"His own family had escaped.",
"The firing from the castle was very severe.",
"It had succeeded well enough in making itself seen.",
"Shall we be slaves or free?",
"Reading them over, they did not satisfy her.",
"Yet, despite the many difficulties, the school was firmly established and continued to make slow but steady progress.",
"The casting the different parts was my next care.",
"She was, as a matter of fact, resting before the work of the evening.",
"She gave a little sigh of relief.",
"Some may protest that a lady moving in such circles would not be so.",
"He closed the door behind them, but did not lock it.",
"She attached an importance to social function, to social opinion, to social duties, which he in no wise understood.",
"She only succeeded in part.",
"Her lips were dry.",
"It is well to keep the lips under control.",
"She tried to speak, but no words came from her lips.",
"She opened her lips, but at first could make no sound.",
"If it produced any bad effects it would need to be corrected, certainly.",
"They must cost a pile of money.",
"They had everything to say to each other, but this sudden falling of the shadow of suffering on their meeting checked the words on their lips.",
"The contemporary historians, however, all have a paragraph for him.",
"As soon as he could speak, he said that just after he had shut up the previous evening, there was a knock at the door.",
"But I held firmly on my way, and the full reward came at last.",
"She left the room, and I heard the key turn in the lock as she entered another chamber.",
"Then again she would sigh deeply and another communication filled her full of anxiety.",
"Half angry and half complaining, she still had to fight against her tears.",
"We are going up to the woods at the back of the castle.",
"It could not be a tree either, for it slowly moved over towards the woods.",
"She had received orders to remind the children of the strict command, and she knew quite well from previous experiences that she could never have succeeded as effectively as he.",
"We fancy it must have been one of these veterans that we met at dinner the other night.",
"It is in every way adapted to the intellectual standard and feelings of the nation.",
"At last we got through and took up a position across the northern end of the woods.",
"They came out of the woods section by section.",
"Then as they approached the barrier they moved slowly and more slowly.",
"The scene that succeeded was very characteristic.",
"Probably they murdered him to cover up the trace.",
"How well he succeeded will soon appear.",
"Beyond all, and throughout all, there was friendship, and there was freedom.",
"We have not yet defeated her.",
"We defeated her by standing out and holding on.",
"Defeat, defeated.",
"Red up, cleared up.",
"After this action there was no longer any friendship between them.",
"This lasted for several days.",
"She caught and held it fast to her lips.",
"They are carefully educated for the highest public duties.",
"On leaving the wood a touching picture met our eyes.",
"A shadow lay in his eyes and his lips were sad.",
"After that his mind slowly cleared.",
"She fought her emotions.",
"He had relaxed.",
"Their lips met.",
"I never appreciated them when I had them.",
"Her arms that had held him so firmly began to slip away.",
"With some of these visitors the friendship was kept up for years.",
"I gave up then for the day, but, as they looked well and were certainly in firmly, I did not consider that I had made an entire failure.",
"It was in parts very touching.",
"A matter of this kind, of course, lay without the province of his official duties.",
"This would satisfy him there was no further danger.",
"I was glad to see him go and closed the door on him with a sigh of relief.",
"I felt confident of that, and in consequence the answer came quickly to my lips.",
"Probably all had not been delivered, yet there was such a pile, I felt no further fear of the few pieces remaining hidden.",
"I went over to the door and listened, but there was no way for me to lock him in.",
"The first thing I need do is to satisfy those men.",
"A uniform cap lay beside him, and I stopped just long enough to scan his features.",
"She extended her arms, and drew me down until our lips met.",
"Apparently the others took him at his word, for not another sign of any of them was seen while night lasted.",
"These he left standing in a little pile.",
"King had appeared late yesterday afternoon, coming out of the woods.",
"Her lips shaped to a half smile.",
"She bit her lips and turned away.",
"Her lips moved but no sound issued.",
"King was counting it fortunate that they were granted so likely a camp site for the night.",
"Breaking branches into short lengths he quickly got a fire going.",
"That marks the place, just at the side of the rock pile.",
"She turned and a little glad cry broke from her lips.",
"A strange little smile touched her lips.",
"It seems that the wild creatures have learned all that is important to their way of life except the changes of the moon.",
"And it ought not to sigh in such good company.",
"These are corrected without mention.",
"Calm is all nature as a resting wheel.",
"Now laugh and be gay, to the woods away!",
"They went to live in the woods in a white tent and had lots of fun.",
"It was an honor which he appreciated, though he had no desire to enter politics.",
"A knock sounded on the door, and when he opened it, the station agent was there, with a long box in his hand.",
"Nothing escaped him, and everything was wrong.",
"It has been hard work, but they have succeeded.",
"He did not believe the machine could be defeated.",
"But never had he yet succeeded.",
"Then hope left the heart of the chief and he prepared to die with all his people and all his slaves.",
"As a consequence there was firing in his direction.",
"I brought these creatures home, put them into their hands, and told them to provide for them.",
"I used often to be in the woods from morning till night.",
"I would be too far away for that, but if my master was standing in some place and I took a long round through the woods, I knew exactly where he was, and could make a short cut back to him without returning in my tracks.",
"They were both powerful creatures, and fairly matched as regarded size.",
"Then she ran away to the woods.",
"They were all wild creatures running about the woods.",
"They are his creatures just as much as we are.",
"Wood turned back his lips and examined it carefully.",
"He only did it once, yet she remembers.",
"He was the black sheep of them all.",
"In a short time, he got an answer from them, which was, at the same time, very proud and very touching.",
"Wood held him firmly, and let her stroke his head as much as she liked.",
"One day I got a great surprise about the sheep.",
"I was sorry for the dogs to be shut up on such a lovely evening, but I suppose their master was afraid of their getting lost, or being stolen, if he let them loose.",
"I followed her about, and kept touching her dress with my nose.",
"His eyes fell upon a paragraph which had previously escaped his notice.",
"If a north wind blew, it was too cold to ride.",
"My dear readers, let me, before touching on the special subject of this paper, say a few words on that of the whole series.",
"There are exceptions.",
"A reasonable question, and one which admits of a full answer.",
"And, as all he has to do, if he is at all talented, is to look into his glass and see himself in the part, he carries it off very well.",
"It is worth our while to survey the accomplished, and to trace its general human significance.",
"He succeeded perfectly.",
"Others succeeded his attempt.",
"The other guns were just where they had been left, and so far as they could see not another thing had been stolen.",
"While in his care it was stolen.",
"I can swim under the water.",
"I think he just went off in the woods.",
"One of them came through the woods and stopped and looked at us.",
"Could it have a spring lock?",
"The girls were all up early the next morning, and soon after breakfast they were on their way to the woods.",
"Was it possible that they had fallen so far and escaped injury?",
"Perhaps it might have escaped his notice, though it escaped that of no other person.",
"A good deal of time, however, had been consumed.",
"Gradually he relaxed, but lay very still.",
"The lips moved.",
"The closed lips were a gain to the eyes and her friends missed nothing.",
"She understood many things that she could not translate into words.",
"He let me help him pile them up.",
"He permits long waiting.",
"That lock was loose, it turned very easily!",
"That is the only way that we can satisfy each other.",
"Then came a light knock on the door.",
"He gave a long sigh.",
"At last it came time to leave the woods, and the boys walked with the girls toward the road.",
"The others were behind him and they, too, tried to open the barrier.",
"The boys heard him pass through the little hall and close and lock the door to the main hall.",
"He stepped between his cousins and laid his hand on the foot of his uncle.",
"His cousins helped in the latter part of this work.",
"He shifted his weight to the other foot.",
"He went out the back door of the hotel so that few people might mark his leaving, and cut for the woods.",
"A pleasant country, a clear sky, and a cool wind touching at his face.",
"Even then he barely escaped.",
"That they will be stolen?",
"But he came back once more, caught her in a tight embrace, and pressed to her lips a long, loving kiss, which she returned with her whole heart.",
"He kept his word that same afternoon, and after a great deal of difficulty he succeeded.",
"He pulled so hard, indeed, that one could hear the sound of his lips.",
"But she is a little stupid, just like a sheep.",
"She was always complaining, was she not?",
"How they have succeeded or failed in this we need not here consider.",
"The circles are formed.",
"And may this league of friendship ever be!",
"I hope he be escaped.",
"She had not escaped yet.",
"She ran away from those cousins of mine.",
"There had been a few, a very few, exceptions.",
"They had made a firm friend of him, and of others whose friendship was worth having.",
"He did so, and the car succeeded.",
"Things seen leave their trace behind the eyes.",
"The firing was now close at hand.",
"He blew it out and went out in the darkness.",
"Her heart and her features are changed by the duties of her situation.",
"We have no such middle emotions as dramatic interests left.",
"The rest of the characters, with very slight exceptions, remained.",
"He is known by his knock.",
"With these exceptions, I can read almost any thing.",
"A sheep, when it is dark, has nothing to do but to shut his silly eyes, and sleep if he can.",
"It is they who are indeed the slaves of the soil.",
"Our situation was really very embarrassing, but not to laugh was impossible.",
"Then the tap and filters were joined to the air pump.",
"Who are these creatures?",
"What numbers of such remarks had escaped a man less uniform in his life, and whose attention had been extended to common objects!",
"The rich give to the poor, but the poor usually save up their earnings to be able to purchase a sheep to kill on this day.",
"On their return, however, they sell them again as slaves, or get rid of them some way or other.",
"The other province refused to satisfy the demand for the same reason.",
"Some have entirely new dresses.",
"How we succeeded in a critical period will be mentioned at the close of the present work.",
"A good deal of animal food is consumed, but few vegetables.",
"So it is with the subject of slaves.",
"There must, however, be some exceptions.",
"I have corrected them as well as I can.",
"I am pleased that he remembers me, and hope that it never can be possible for me to forget him.",
"A small house and a large garden a block away from my place were now rented by him.",
"I had stolen a day from that world.",
"I tried twice before I succeeded in finding my voice.",
"A knock on the front door failed to produce any response.",
"The agent shifted his position.",
"But exceptions prove the rule.",
"I never knew before what winter woods were like.",
"And yet there is the constant barrier between the officer and the man.",
"We are no more than our neighbors, and there are exceptions, in all communities as in all families.",
"Have we no duties?",
"Convert him?",
"As he went out at the door, he caught an opportunity of saying one word to the convert.",
"To sigh till again I shall join her above!",
"I would most certainly decline to eat food cooked from the same plate with my son or to drink water out of a cup which his lips have touched and which has not been washed.",
"I called on the dealer, but he was not to be seen.",
"I wrote to the dealer, but received no answer.",
"Poor creatures!",
"Nothing would satisfy the good woman but that we must call at the college to see her husband.",
"It is a great comfort to have the ground cleared in this respect.",
"The firing continued until next day.",
"Take that fellow and lock him up!",
"She looked away from him, drew her chair a little closer to the fire, and sat with her head resting upon her hands.",
"She drew her hand away from his and held it to his lips.",
"The words seemed to die away upon her lips.",
"Her face cleared.",
"She closed her lips again.",
"Then he gave a great sigh of satisfaction.",
"Then there was a loud knock at the door, which was opened without waiting for any reply.",
"My lips were quite dry.",
"A woman, wrapped in a long coat, stepped inside, closing it firmly behind her.",
"Her lips came together in familiar fashion.",
"Then I am going to lock myself in my room and change everything.",
"There was a little knock at the door.",
"The knock was repeated.",
"Panel never opened her lips.",
"Small duties were ill done or not done at all.",
"Before he put it to his lips he looked at me.",
"His hold on the gun relaxed.",
"A deep sigh escaped from his lips.",
"A laugh started from the lips of the crowd.",
"In this book I have sought to trace the course of our religious poetry from an early period of our literary history.",
"Still again my shadow escaped me.",
"The fire consumed it.",
"There was a knock at the chamber door.",
"In this first object I, to a certain extent, succeeded.",
"For the future she would have to watch her father closely, would perhaps have to lock the door of his room.",
"I put it at a bank just now, and it cleared it like a bird.",
"There are the sheep.",
"She opened her lips, then checked herself.",
"Her lips moved.",
"I shall make all good what was stolen.",
"And each of them gave him a sheep and a gold ring for his ears.",
"Creation was not finished till the poet came to interpret, and so complete it.",
"He barely succeeded in making his escape.",
"Why should they introduce an innovation?",
"He succeeded.",
"From time to time the crowd were silent and listened, and distant firing was heard.",
"Let us at once state the conclusion of this touching incident.",
"None escaped.",
"I had blood upon my lips.",
"During all this time there was continued file firing.",
"At length, however, they pressed so closely to each other, that they succeeded in lying down at full length.",
"This kind of success permits itself everything.",
"But these were exceptions.",
"Now, all is well, they have succeeded, they have a fair wind, they enjoy themselves to the full.",
"On the other hand, when the child is of a weak and relaxed habit, but free from organic disease, the cold bath will be highly useful, provided sufficient power of reaction exist in the system.",
"A moderate quantity of clothing is all that is required, adapted to the heat of skin and feelings of the patient.",
"The slaves, whose cases I have been considering, were resident in different parts of the world.",
"His slaves, he tells us, had been reduced in number by bad management.",
"There came a knock at the door.",
"At sound of the knock, the husband and father seemed to have suddenly changed.",
"Then he painted his face black as his enemies had done, and thus escaped.",
"A wind instrument, she did nothing but sigh.",
"Surely he could raise among his friends the small sum he needed, and then he would go into the woods.",
"Has it escaped me, when it was mine?",
"But there I sat day by day, week by week, and month by month, waiting for the knock that never came, hoping for the business that might never come.",
"And are there not commercial circles also which could not exist without their equally innocent supporters?",
"One never knows what friendship is and what friends are till one is ill.",
"We were on friendly and even familiar terms, although I never borrowed any money of him in my life.",
"I succeeded in winning his case, and never was more proud of a victory.",
"It had lasted many days.",
"The key was not in the lock, neither had it fallen out, or it would have been found somewhere near.",
"The customer looked through his accounts and found no trace of it or the amount for which it was given.",
"Its voice is not a sigh, but a song.",
"Then he lay down on the bed to think, but without removing any of his clothing.",
"His face cleared as reflection led to determination.",
"The key turned in the lock.",
"The lock was set in the wood.",
"Gradually his mind cleared.",
"I went into the woods alone.",
"No doubt he will demand a good price for slaves of this character.",
"Upon these instructions of the judge, to which bills of exceptions were filed by my counsel, the case, which had been already near a week on trial, was argued to the jury.",
"Did he not know they were slaves?",
"And, looking at those facts, is it necessary for me to open my lips in reply?",
"The judge laid down the same law as before, and similar exceptions were taken by my counsel.",
"The thin lips of the other moved, his hand quickly extended but was drawn as suddenly back.",
"His duties he performed now as quietly as he could.",
"No trace of her could be found.",
"His figure relaxed.",
"Her fingers placed it in the rented coat.",
"Apartments to be found in all parts.",
"Apartments all over the town.",
"So far she had quite escaped notice.",
"As much as she could she kept under cover, while at the same time firing into the darkness whenever she thought she saw a movement.",
"The brown fingers relaxed.",
"He knew she had done this in order not to run the risk of touching him.",
"What white man had any business in these woods?",
"One was white to the lips.",
"He looked up into the branches of the trees.",
"No sound came from the locked lips.",
"The train passed out of the woods to the shore of the lake.",
"They traveled fast over the ice and reached the woods beyond.",
"Day succeeded day, each with its routine much the same as the one before.",
"He was not sure yet that he was out of the woods.",
"His lips moved, but no sound came from them.",
"She went to the bottom again, and after half an hour succeeded in getting clear of the net.",
"It now remains to state, so far as my information admits, the effect of those measures.",
"Everybody used to invite her to their houses, it seems.",
"I felt that, in another moment, if he found what she had hidden, her heart would knock no longer, and she would die.",
"As we stood listening, there came a knock at the front door.",
"But I knew what had been on his lips to say.",
"Friendship, like credit, is highest where it is not used.",
"But if it is alive again, it will probably find out who it was that defeated it before.",
"And lock the door.",
"Next room, check, lock the door.",
"Heroes require a perspective.",
"This little speech is the last characteristic expression which escaped from the dying man.",
"Having destroyed it, why did he then tell the slaves who he was?",
"And besides, it might be something serious that almost had escaped her lips.",
"He closed his lips tight.",
"But he is fortunate.",
"It lasted several minutes.",
"He must have got out of himself, and gone into the woods.",
"They would offer slaves.",
"The tension relaxed.",
"He put her aside firmly, every inch the father.",
"How fortunate, she said.",
"It is impossible to trace the processes of this man.",
"On this their friendship began.",
"And her mind worked and she caught at the moment before it had escaped.",
"Nothing escaped her.",
"What an excellent setting out and how properly is this form of speech adapted to history!",
"I never saw so many slaves at one time before.",
"All the trees that blew down during the summer were left as they fell till winter when they were removed.",
"This went on, year after year, until all the trees were cleared out.",
"In summer time the cooking for the slaves was done out of doors.",
"A little gift from the master was greatly appreciated by them.",
"Even the older slaves would join in the discussion of the coming event.",
"The slaves worked with all their might.",
"The sheep were treated in the same way, and both were turned from side to side as they cooked.",
"The slaves had the whole day off, and could do as they liked.",
"All of this work was done by the slaves.",
"In the new home my duties were harder than ever.",
"When she called me I did not go, but went off down through the garden and through the woods, and made my way for the city.",
"This was especially for the keeping of slaves who had run away and been caught.",
"Of course all such slaves carried a written pass to this effect.",
"Then I went into the woods.",
"Many old slaves were guided in this way when traveling in the night, and some could tell the time of night by the position of the stars.",
"Though slaves were property, and valuable on that account, the whites seemed to think that their own lives were in danger, and to be protected first.",
"But law in the abstract, and law as it is interpreted and applied, are not even second cousins.",
"It was the judge, not the evidence, that defeated me.",
"She was lying looking up through the green branches of the trees.",
"She had been reading, but her book was now closed, and she was lying quietly looking up at the blue sky between the branches.",
"Woods, here.",
"The exceptions were the major and herself.",
"Woods was not fortunate in the selection of his subject, on the occasion of which we are writing.",
"Woods, go with us to the gate, and let us out.",
"The scene that succeeded is not easily described.",
"On examination, the lock of the inner gate was still secure.",
"We can trace it to no ordinary physical resource.",
"Another barrier gave way beside.",
"Then he told me how a man went out one night, many years ago, to steal sheep.",
"It is regarded as the parent organization, all others being branches, though each is entirely independent in the management of its own affairs.",
"I tried to trace her without result.",
"Already, with the words not cold upon his lips, he was surprised that he had told the story.",
"What if, some time, he should hear a like phrase used to describe their wonderful friendship?",
"Her red lips set themselves in a firm line.",
"Her eyes shifted and fell.",
"With set lips, the doctor gave in.",
"Then, with a long breath of relief, the tension relaxed.",
"She had forgotten to lock the door!",
"His lips moved but there was no sound.",
"A long sigh passed over the room.",
"The main body of our command had meanwhile arrived, and got into the row without ceremony, the firing now being heavy on both sides.",
"He looked at the strip of woods, but could see nothing of the singer.",
"Its lock does not appear to be of anything but an ordinary nature.",
"There was very little life in those woods.",
"The result was that the bears at once made for the woods, and we both missed.",
"In order to avoid these, we kept just inside the woods.",
"She half fell, and bit for the wound, and as she slowly started for the woods I gave her another shot which rolled her over.",
"The bears had entered the woods, so we settled ourselves for a long wait.",
"Then he turned, and, looking back over his shoulder, made slowly for the woods.",
"We could then push over the hills in different directions until we came upon the sheep.",
"This was the first great band of white sheep I had seen, and I watched them at this close range with much interest.",
"That morning we traveled some distance before we saw sheep, but having once reached their feeding ground I had the satisfaction of watching more wild game than on any previous day.",
"This was the limit which we had decided upon as the number of sheep that we each wanted.",
"So I sat and studied these sheep through the glasses, determined to find them later, even if it took me a month.",
"Late in the afternoon we succeeded in getting a fire started and had a square meal.",
"We now felt quite certain that these were the sheep we knew so well.",
"Although a sheep with a broken leg finds it hard to go up hill over rough ground, it is surprising how fast they can go down hill or across the open.",
"I had now reached the limit I had set on sheep, and although I saw some later, I did not go after them.",
"Wherever the country was adapted to them, there they were found.",
"They are great hands to kill sheep in about the same place.",
"A mountain sheep always seems to fear the thing that he sees under him.",
"I have sometimes been riding around in the mountains, and have come on sheep right below me.",
"We went up toward it, and I saw the sheep moving about.",
"Here the sheep lay down.",
"The sheep stood up and looked at me.",
"Look at the sheep!",
"Indeed, it is thought by some that sheep are more numerous there now than they were a few years ago.",
"As nearly as I could tell, they ranged winter and summer on nearly the same ground.",
"This does not seem to be particularly due to hunting, but the sheep seem to be either moving away or dying out.",
"I never saw any sheep in the range, nor do I know of any one more fortunate than myself in that respect.",
"No other animal will feed after the sheep.",
"If this bill were to become law in its present form, the object for which it was created would be largely defeated.",
"The position was embarrassing.",
"They were not equally fortunate there.",
"He had either run away or been stolen, I could not tell which.",
"I was not able to trace him.",
"The child lay back with a sigh of relief.",
"He held himself firmly by the back of a chair, and listened as to a voice that had been familiar to him in some state of being prior to his life on earth.",
"A smile seemed to be playing about the lips.",
"It seemed almost as though the lips might part and speak to him.",
"But it had cleared off cold.",
"Then a light of recognition came into his eyes, and a smile to his lips.",
"It was fortunate, he thought, that he had selected that place for it, as he was now in great need of it.",
"A few minutes later there came a gentle knock at the street door.",
"The boy did not open his eyes, but his lips moved.",
"The summer passed and the singing birds grew silent in the woods and fields.",
"The principle has of late been relaxed.",
"I was not so fortunate for a long time.",
"A man will meet death much more firmly at one time than another.",
"A sheep can give them little trouble.",
"I was also fortunate enough frequently to draw him forth to talk, when he would otherwise have been silent.",
"They have a good many sheep, which they eat mostly themselves, and sell but a few.",
"In such a season good firing was of no small importance.",
"He has succeeded in life through his own energy, and he is the only member of my family who has never applied to me for assistance.",
"During sleep the voluntary muscles are relaxed, and those of organic life work with less energy.",
"The advantages to be derived, during the school period, from the proper care and development of the body, should be understood and appreciated by school officials, teachers, and parents.",
"The amount of water consumed depends largely upon the amount of work performed by the body, and upon the temperature.",
"The blood, as we have learned, not only provides material for the growth and activity of all the tissues of the body, but also serves as a means of removing from them the products of their activity.",
"Apply each to different parts of the surface, and ask the person whether the touching body is hot or cold.",
"First, there is a special structure adapted to a particular kind of influence.",
"The differences in their characters are produced by changes in the position of the tongue, mouth, and lips.",
"They should always be put in some secure place under lock and key.",
"Crime succeeded.",
"At last the horrible mystery was cleared up.",
"We translate it from the words of an individual who was present when it happened.",
"The lock was picked, and the chest flew open.",
"But he was too happy to interpret her tone.",
"He cannot be defeated or put down.",
"And a most touching picture it is.",
"She was quietly resting in bed.",
"Night came, and behind the trees, through the branches, the sky appeared like a sheet of blood.",
"And the trip lasted a long, long time.",
"Sometimes it told of other lives he believes himself to have lived in other centuries, sometimes of people he had talked to, revealing them to their own minds.",
"Each admits the other side to have feelings.",
"Killed a sheep.",
"Party resting.",
"Men employed as before, and the general duties of the camp.",
"Party employed in general duties of the camp.",
"We, however, cleared out the loose earth, but found nothing.",
"Permits the lady to see it.",
"All the others gave up to him, when his lips began to open.",
"But he knew there was a wood on the other side, a wood he had always been too tired to think of exploring, even on holidays.",
"Had they sent him, perhaps, to do a different kind of work that could only be done in the woods?",
"How cold the wind felt as it blew over his face!",
"But she put her finger to her lips.",
"Still the bird escaped, pulling the food out with its long bill and never getting inside the door.",
"Shall we swim in it?",
"He knew that she was from the free states, where they did not keep slaves, and he thought, perhaps, if she knew his desire to read she would help him.",
"She was talented in music, playing the piano with a technique and fire that few girls of her age could equal.",
"A sound, like a great sigh, was heard in the room.",
"One day he was resting under a great green tree, feeling really quite happy because everything was so beautiful.",
"She never appreciated me.",
"Knock, then, at the gate.",
"Had that incident escaped notice?",
"This was to an extent fortunate.",
"The man placed his finger on his lips, although the wind prevented any sound of voices being heard within.",
"She recalled our early friendship, when she used to sit on my knee and make me draw pictures for her and tell her stories.",
"In the middle of the night I heard a knock at my door.",
"He bit upon his lips and tried to sit up.",
"By the time the rain fell and cleared the snow away, I had everything ready.",
"Then, without waiting for anyone to second him, he jumped among his enemies, and drove them like sheep before him, till they threw down their arms.",
"Then he sat down on the further side of his barrier, so that none might issue forth, nor enter in.",
"He was out of his depth and unable to swim.",
"She was ready for sea the night before, the officers and crew had all come back from short leave, and the working parties had cleared out.",
"Which is indeed fortunate.",
"And, going up to the pile of papers which he had laid upon the table, he drew one forth and held it up so that all might see.",
"It is perfectly possible that he is, after all, and it is our business to trace him, if he is still in the land of the living.",
"It is in some court, but the name of that court has escaped me for the moment.",
"I have not one single fact of which I can say that it admits only of a single interpretation.",
"Could the change be due to our growing friendship?",
"We see means adapted to an end.",
"We cannot interpret history without the recognition of this fundamental truth.",
"But these sheep, what have they done?",
"A mistake corrected.",
"Having succeeded in raising themselves from the floor, they soon learn to stand, by holding to the object by which they have raised themselves.",
"There are some exceptions to the general truth contained in the last paragraph.",
"There are a few exceptions to the truth of this remark.",
"He was used for good but deserves and receives no credit for it.",
"They could not find a trace of it.",
"Even they, in a social point of view, were slaves.",
"They are simply their victims or their slaves.",
"Of course there were exceptions.",
"When the dishes were removed, and we had washed our hands, he dismissed his slaves and told them to go to rest.",
"A window appeared suddenly, to which were attached a chain and lock.",
"He cannot find the glass, and his father must put it to his lips.",
"There came a knock.",
"I have a sigh in my heart yet!",
"Their characters are now to be considered as cleared up.",
"These men have combined together, and have stolen a woman.",
"On the left of the chairman is another lady, whose name is well known in literary circles.",
"So it is that men sigh on, not knowing what the soul wants, but only that it needs something.",
"It was expected that all the members would take their meals at the common table, yet exceptions were allowed in certain cases.",
"And yet crowds of people were coming from all directions.",
"The plan, however, did not fully satisfy the people in the village, as it failed to provide for an evening service.",
"And in the next place, this money had been borrowed of innocent parties, and it was but right that it should be returned.",
"The duties of the day are ever upon us, and we must away at their call.",
"Certainly something was heavy upon her, for there was no smile in the sigh that came deeply from her heart, as she locked the door.",
"Poor creatures?",
"Their friendship did not need letters.",
"But then they are the exceptions.",
"With some exceptions every one we met treated the machine with a consideration it did not deserve.",
"This wind blew directly over the lake to them.",
"It was a tree in shape, with stem and branches, but it was like a spirit of water.",
"They were fast friends as well as cousins.",
"It is based as firmly in the next world as it is in this.",
"Her lips move, but no sound comes from them.",
"This year there will be no crop at all.",
"Her dark dress, though not consumed, strikes hot against his chest.",
"He has set his foot firmly upon the stone steps.",
"She gave a happy sigh.",
"What he had on his lips need not be written.",
"It was most touching.",
"I was resting.",
"Persons under strong emotions, as a rule, commit themselves.",
"There is a knock at the door.",
"Her lips move as if to speak, but no sound comes.",
"The storm of war once more rolled by, and a temporary calm succeeded.",
"But I had not been laid down quite half an hour, when there was a loud knock at the door.",
"Pile up the fire here!",
"And as I looked, I saw that this was not dust, but people coming in crowds from the other side, but so small as to be visible at first only as dust.",
"They convert one another, almost as much as they convert plants.",
"They would have tried and not succeeded.",
"Interpret a negative result.",
"The manner escaped her observation.",
"Perhaps before another sun I may be changed, and then what will become of the sheep?",
"He was able to turn himself towards her and move her hand to his lips, the second, only the second and the last kiss.",
"There is something very touching in the love of a dog.",
"All rules have their exceptions.",
"I shifted my weight forward, and made the nose come down.",
"But there were exceptions.",
"It was an embarrassing moment.",
"At any rate, the experiment succeeded.",
"Do all interpret?",
"Teach and urge these duties.",
"But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns.",
"I made my own dresses.",
"As she relaxed, her eyes came back to her sister.",
"His lips were very dry.",
"She had not been cleared.",
"How she ever succeeded is beyond me.",
"I learned to swim on the beach here at that time myself.",
"All who had watched them start to swim out had taken for granted that they had joined the others on the stage.",
"I have nothing to look after except my house, and I sit at my window and see the stream of life pass without touching me.",
"It was a spring lock.",
"But of the missing man no trace was found.",
"No trace of him was ever discovered.",
"We have got double weights at the guys, and hope to get it up like a shot.",
"As if I had not borrowed the ideas of the half of my own!",
"It is fortunate indeed that we can do so, being both for a while longer in the day.",
"To be sure, there are many exceptions.",
"A sheep.",
"I swim.",
"A lock.",
"Follow, trace, track.",
"We cannot consider how education may fit them for any widely extending duty, until we are agreed what is their true constant duty.",
"This was in the middle of our rounds.",
"The tickets are collected as the passengers pass through the barrier at the end of the journey."],

"What a minister was intended for, was to stand head and shoulders above other men.",
"Though resigned to death, I am content to live.",
"There is nothing ever wrong with me, but a little weakness.",
"She turned round smiling, but made no answer, only continued to smile on me.",
"I certainly had never seen her upon her knees.",
"It was in a dark loose dress, and its hair was down and covered its shoulders.",
"The morning was passed in alarm and excitement.",
"I cannot yet declare myself.",
"But by hanging around the door of the shipping room I soon had track of the large orders to be sent that day.",
"However, as to my first purpose in this adventure I had evolved another plan, and therefore was content.",
"The excitement died.",
"Just as silent as before, but it was a smiling, satisfied silence.",
"Then he would leap in the air.",
"I had little expectation of finding him, dead or alive.",
"Then the excitement would begin.",
"The ladies, it is true, never, or rarely, want money.",
"I pressed my hand and the tips of my fingers in every direction along the wall.",
"I have not heard that he has married again, but he probably will, sooner or later.",
"He was anxious to know several things which I was glad to be in a position to tell him.",
"He had come at last to close quarters with her.",
"What happiness!",
"Then, too, she was anxious to see her mother and sisters again.",
"She put his strong black arms around her little shoulders.",
"Instead they made him die sooner.",
"The forests are wild and hard to get through.",
"Most of the people are anxious to help.",
"The trouble and excitement were too much for her.",
"He will cross a field although there is a dog inside the fence.",
"We are alive for excitement.",
"But the trail ended with the turning of the page.",
"In doing this, we have the advantage of knowing the final estimate of the books they judged.",
"These preparations had been made none too soon.",
"It was on the whole a happy and fitting end.",
"He took drawings of the place, and then went on a tour to many southern cities.",
"Then followed a scene of excitement and danger.",
"No sooner thought of than done.",
"That night he hardly slept.",
"He laid his hand over hers.",
"Toward morning she even slept sitting.",
"It had a collapsed look.",
"He linked his arm into hers.",
"She turned his face back to her, smiling through her own tears.",
"He reached across the counter, placing his hand over hers.",
"The clock seemed to go slower and slower, until they really began to wonder whether it had stopped.",
"The wave of excitement caused by the elections soon passed over.",
"Otherwise this would have come to light sooner.",
"There was a strange excitement in her voice, though none in the set face.",
"I shut the door, and then crossing to where the man lay, struck a match and held it out to get a view of him.",
"I searched for an explanation.",
"For no sooner was I out of one trouble than another was ready for me.",
"We had started on our trip with everything in good shape, following the above described trail.",
"One of the party was to stand guard while the others slept.",
"The civil war had broken out, and excitement ran high in that part of the country.",
"We then pushed out on the trail as fast as possible.",
"Soon all was excitement among the officers and soldiers, every one being anxious to charge the village.",
"There was no backing out after that.",
"He would allow the strongest boy in the school to strike him with full force in the chest.",
"This weakness grows upon me.",
"I would retire.",
"Because there were some considerations of deep interest beyond.",
"He draws back his arm, and seems hurt.",
"Deal gently with him.",
"I was so afraid father would catch me that I came across the fields, and it was just as much as he could do to take the last fence.",
"He ought to be glad to go down on his knees to serve her, she is so sweet, so dear!",
"I want my boy to be respected and to have a place in the world.",
"I declare, it makes my heart warm.",
"Some day she would be free to carry out this beautiful dream of hers.",
"That was what he had said, this strong, true friend of hers, that night he asked the question which he had never asked again.",
"Each one knew by the wild excitement in his own breast, how in secret he had been brought to doubt its being here.",
"Trail in fair condition, weather gray and steady.",
"It would be happiness just to rest here and go to sleep.",
"They all admitted that the trail was the final test.",
"They took the trail for town.",
"Before applying these principles it is necessary for practical considerations to set out clearly the various stages of this period.",
"On the other hand he may be content with strokes.",
"We could keep our hands touching the trail all the way up.",
"They were out looking for knees for their boats.",
"The few documents that required printing had always been done in the mother country.",
"Excitement ran high and many an argument ended with a bloody nose.",
"Quantities of provisions were lost.",
"There was no trail.",
"He was not anxious to fill any position of civil or military trust, even if it had been pressed upon him.",
"Yet he must, at all times, show all possible respect for the uniform that he wears and the great nation that he represents.",
"Let us tear this up.",
"And these professional musicians will tear her reputation to pieces among themselves!",
"He picked up some kind of a trail, which we followed through the long afternoon.",
"The crisis came sooner than I looked for.",
"That very day I had finished my preparations.",
"At the moment I did not see the object of these preparations, but now I can understand it.",
"And yet my strongest feeling was a wild regret.",
"However, they had too much to talk about just then to do much wondering about anything, and they walked slowly toward home, asking and answering a very flood of questions.",
"As the time drew near they could hardly contain their excitement, and the boys, who had decided they would follow the girls some days later, were almost as bad.",
"And an adventure she somehow felt sure it was to be.",
"She slept little, as is common enough at her age.",
"No one can be more anxious than I.",
"Naturally we are very anxious.",
"He had come by train, and I let him in gently myself.",
"He jumped down into it in great excitement, and called me to follow.",
"My heart made all at once a sudden leap in my breast.",
"After a while I went back to my own room, and finished the evening in my usual way, without any return of the excitement which, now that it was over, looked to me like some extraordinary dream.",
"How full of trouble is my anxious heart!",
"No home have I, having no lover!",
"Farther down the stream another king was walking and looking about, when he saw the wooden box floating in the water.",
"Not the lovers back so early?",
"She was smiling still as she gave him her hand, but he saw that tears stood in her eyes.",
"No excitement.",
"The drawings required by the paper never occupied her more than a couple of hours each day.",
"She heard him leap from bed and open the blind.",
"The expectation then expressed has not been disappointed.",
"The trees of the coal forests present parallel conditions.",
"The only man in the family is a private soldier, when he might have been high in rank, with such influences as we could bring to bear.",
"He almost falls from the tree in his excitement.",
"Then the hospital reports were searched.",
"Then the kind soul told the story, charging the sister never to reveal the facts.",
"He is a soldier.",
"Her heart gave a wild leap.",
"The soldier asked her no questions, and of course she could ask none, as probably her father was unknown to the military filling the place.",
"He took her gently by the shoulders and pushed her out of the room.",
"So I, a soldier, loving my profession, do stand for method in all things.",
"He saw her gather the wrap a little closer about her shoulders, and that sign of fear made him sick at heart.",
"The other fell on his knees.",
"The strain was broken and in its place there was a mutual excitement.",
"And all on one trail?",
"Obviously the danger was not directly hers, but then it must be directed at some one near to her.",
"I have all the weakness of other girls.",
"He was not smiling now.",
"What an adventure!",
"The old man collapsed on the lower step.",
"The old man rolled his great head between his shoulders.",
"They could see him across the slope of the hill.",
"Once he saw some of them jumping.",
"He was not a soldier.",
"He got down on his hands and knees.",
"Perhaps the little artist could not tear himself away from his work.",
"But he did not mind being left all alone in these dark forests.",
"He made some pretty little drawings.",
"And the more he slept on the floor, the more he liked a good bed.",
"This friend took it to a printing office.",
"He was so careful to have his drawings just like the birds, that he would measure them in every way.",
"He was floating on a piece of ice.",
"He walked up and down in front of the printing office.",
"A sharp blow on the nose hurts him a great deal.",
"The one that spelled a word that he missed would have a right to take the head of the class.",
"Suppose we laugh low or gently or to ourselves.",
"She was kind, conventional, and generally anxious to take the proper line.",
"He stated the house was new and beginning to pay, and he was anxious about its character.",
"If he were her husband, she would not have run away from him, and it did not look as if he were her lover.",
"The other stepped back, and his gesture implied that he refused to go.",
"All the same, we were partners in an adventure that ought to make us friends.",
"He liked his hosts.",
"Just now the shares of very few shipping companies are worth their face value.",
"He was old and must be resigned to sit at his desk and plan, but, as a rule, his plans worked, and he had a talent for choosing his tools.",
"Brown searched the dark coast with his glasses, trying to find the marks he had noted on the chart.",
"To feel she could not help was hard, but she tried to be resigned and stopped in the quiet room, listening for steps.",
"He searched for the key.",
"It was a tear from her great eyes.",
"Why should it stand so high at the shoulders?",
"One had lost a brother at the front, the other her lover.",
"The excitement of battle was not for them.",
"An index of expectation!",
"They are the buyers in the working class and in the professional class.",
"He had judged the time and the distance perfectly.",
"Each had determined that if discovered, he would make an effort to escape in the nearest of the aircraft.",
"His long, powerful strokes sent him through the water at great speed.",
"They have made no preparations to fire.",
"If not, we are all to retire slowly.",
"Then we shall retire.",
"He pushed to closer quarters.",
"And the chance was to come sooner than he expected.",
"And the trouble was to come sooner than could have been expected.",
"But the sooner we get to shore the sooner I will be able to have it looked after.",
"Again they searched the house.",
"The probabilities are that he would think he had dropped it while walking.",
"It did but make me wish to know more of this great lover of my sex.",
"Then I thought of the great judge, my lover.",
"They must not know he was my lover.",
"So I searched for the spring and I found it.",
"It has never quite slept since.",
"That I succeeded at last I judged from the fact that the second man left the room.",
"Her character I had judged from her face, which was lovely.",
"I slept that night.",
"He felt his heart leap.",
"They would all know sooner than I.",
"The universal silence gave way to a universal sigh of excitement and relief.",
"Features set like hers force themselves to be seen.",
"I must declare this, and she must believe me.",
"This was where the ladies had been when I listened before, but they were not here now.",
"The man was taking up their trail.",
"It was not a clean running trail.",
"She dropped on her knees in the snow, just out of reach.",
"He was a lover of wild things, and for that reason he never carried a gun.",
"The trail they found was old.",
"Half a dozen battles were fought to the death each day and night.",
"Out of the earth began to spring tips of green.",
"With almost human intelligence the little engineers kept at their task.",
"All that day he searched for her along the river and out on the plain.",
"All that day he searched.",
"His arms closed gently about her.",
"He made his purchases, and was well supplied.",
"He spends the night upon the trail.",
"He draws the water.",
"He draws near, and they see that it is he.",
"He searched a long time without finding it, and finally went home to rest.",
"The woman and her husband slept also.",
"They searched her hair and found the knife still covered with blood, which gave evidence of the crime.",
"Even then I failed to understand what the old soldier meant, and asked him to explain more fully, which he did.",
"But he only answered by going back into the room to make an anxious survey of his reflection in the glass.",
"Such preparations as were made for that tea!",
"The anxious father could not leave the spot.",
"A lover, the last or little finger.",
"Putting aside, then, all moral considerations, let us examine and value the economic facts.",
"When his father found that he had learned to read, then he judged it good for him to go to school.",
"But his father grew anxious.",
"Finding himself then, as it were, in a house of his own, he began to ask his friends in the village to come and see him in his new quarters.",
"An hour or so after, as he was finishing off something about the mouth of the well, he heard his father calling him.",
"He held me tight against him, and I felt a tear fall upon my head.",
"Often I remained thus until some one came for me and led me gently back into the house.",
"Had I not determined to be a soldier, and how was a soldier to find employment, but in war?",
"We had both, perhaps, had a glass of wine too much before we joined the ladies.",
"He alleged that he must go into winter quarters, and that, too, though it was just the height of summer.",
"And after no long space the king also died, and slept with his fathers.",
"But in that matter there are not a few considerations to be kept in mind.",
"Those who live nearest the truth of their own hearts are nearest to the hearts of others.",
"For ordinary heavy military traffic the engineers made good going by taking off about one foot of the top soil and banking it on either side of the road.",
"It was too bad for words, for even the strongest.",
"The officer in front points smiling to a field just ahead.",
"But what preparations everywhere!",
"Then the town passes, and we are out again in the open country, leaving the mining village behind.",
"So it is that the flying forms in the upper air become for the soldier below so many symbols of help and protection.",
"But the night in the quiet village wears away.",
"They searched everywhere, and, of course, found nothing.",
"When they arrived there a soldier separated them so roughly that the wife fell.",
"And the village insists that she shall claim her rights!",
"One day, I passed a soldier who was lying back in his bed with a sigh of satisfaction.",
"He was anxious to find out.",
"Probably it took the tear for a drop of rain just fallen out of the sky.",
"And she knew it, and was troubled in her mind, and anxious to do something to make him forget that great blue water.",
"For a considerable time she searched in her books for the name, and at last discovered it.",
"The more I thought it over, the more anxious did I become.",
"Then I began to be anxious.",
"I shall tear up this contract.",
"How little the individual soldier knows of what is happening at these times!",
"Great excitement, as was only natural, developed among those behind us.",
"Then I went to bed and slept for hours and hours.",
"The village lies at the foot of the slope.",
"One felt expectation everywhere in the air.",
"We had certainly been spotted.",
"And he followed them, closing the door gently behind him.",
"Sooner or later he sees one that in some strange way seems different.",
"They were entering the village, and could see down the long, wide slope of the hill.",
"Treat him gently.",
"A girl may say anything to save her supposed lover.",
"Winter looked anxious.",
"Trail, indeed it will.",
"His happiness and pleasure in the country were extreme.",
"My aunt began to cry.",
"Days were passed in talks, visits, preparations.",
"She had gone on a visit to her sick aunt.",
"His strength their own weakness.",
"It must have something which is not itself to love that it may go out of itself, and forget itself, and spend itself in the good and in the happiness of what it loves.",
"Our true strength is to know our own weakness.",
"Are they the anxious people?",
"Each day he will set about the duty which lies nearest him, with a whole heart and with a single eye, giving himself to it for the time, as if there was nothing else to be done in the world.",
"These preparations caused an anxious moment for both parties.",
"No matter what good advice we gave them, they were caught sooner or later.",
"No sooner said than done.",
"She called to him to come to her, and great was the joy of these lovers at seeing each other again.",
"Of course the business made me rich, and I bought real estate with my extra money, and doubled my fortune again and again.",
"I judged so when I saw them together.",
"I like both that and the supplement, without an exception.",
"But it hurt their frames.",
"But, as the evening was not far spent, he proposed that we should go at once to see a few of those which were nearest.",
"The old man spoke very few words the whole time we were there, but he kept smiling and going on with his washing.",
"Sitting smiling by the window, he looked as if he had lots of fun in him, if he only had a fair chance of letting it off.",
"My friend knew the family, and we called there more for the purpose of resting ourselves and having a chat than anything else.",
"Well, that is to say, they were recordings of current events at the time he wrote them, but they are now history.",
"But sooner or later, the man who wins.",
"He made his leap.",
"She had no sooner started when lots of little animals appeared as if from nowhere and gathered around to listen.",
"How did she manage to lift that son of hers?",
"The mother looked up at her, the most pleasant smile crossing her face.",
"On it she was anxious to concentrate all her powers.",
"Hers were no light trials.",
"Where now are all their anxious thoughts of home?",
"One morning, my uncle and aunt went abroad before breakfast, and took my cousins with them.",
"But my aunt was no reader.",
"My room was next to where my aunt usually sat when she was alone.",
"He mentioned the names of several ladies who might have been, but were not, of the committee.",
"I am anxious to see her.",
"For the first time his eyes met hers.",
"They were silent, for the ladies were tired and cold.",
"He began his simple preparations at once.",
"She had not lost color, but there was an anxious look in her eyes.",
"It will be a great happiness to me.",
"There is much happiness in life to make up for the rest.",
"But that happiness must be firmly held.",
"That I may tear her eyes!",
"At that point the leader felt more than a little anxious.",
"If I seemed to be, I apologize on the spot.",
"The great need is the strongest argument for the highest education.",
"He respected it altogether, and the more because he well knew that here was no need for mere talk.",
"But I had an object apart from these considerations.",
"I regret to say that some of these were ladies.",
"The trail was narrow and difficult.",
"The women slept but little.",
"So does the soldier in a campaign.",
"When other visitors are announced, it is well to retire as soon as possible, taking care to let it appear that their arrival is not the cause.",
"It is consequently dangerous to eat them in large quantities.",
"The quantities may be varied according to the amount of fish used.",
"The room should be dry, and well aired, but should not admit the sun.",
"Let it cool a few minutes, then with a clean sharp knife cut it into small square pieces, which should be gently removed to a large flat dish to cool before putting away.",
"The law does not regard a day as consisting of portions.",
"Ladies, attend!",
"The next morning I slept late.",
"I cannot go to the houses of my nearest relatives, because I do not wish to be alone.",
"On the right is a wooden fence which we can easily climb.",
"The mother had put off preparations for dinner on purpose.",
"The ladies wanted my opinion before deciding.",
"In that case she could soon see her brother again, for the ladies had promised to take her home as soon as she was well.",
"The excitement only grew at this.",
"She was very anxious for them to pay her a visit, for which she was already making plans.",
"Change base and slope other way.",
"As a general thing the fire would be out long before they arrived upon the scene, and they would then return to their quarters, have another beer and be dismissed.",
"They found our lines well prepared and in full expectation of their coming.",
"We pushed on to the forest and fell down in our tracks and slept all day.",
"Even the churches have not been respected.",
"All my thoughts, as far as pain and increasing weakness allowed, were fixed on my family.",
"Private property will be absolutely respected and provisions paid for.",
"Down they fell upon their knees, nor could they say a word.",
"Then there was a new excitement.",
"It was a new excitement, and had I not recovered my ring?",
"All that night he never slept.",
"The strongest elements of both were brought together.",
"Some portions of the original building remain.",
"Their excitement worries themselves more than it hurts others.",
"In what do the greatest number find their happiness?",
"How far is the happiness of one consistent with the happiness of another?",
"What will a child learn sooner than a song?",
"Yet at this time he found no need of arms to oppose them.",
"Consequently he turned back and began his preparations against them.",
"Consequently I did not declare war upon him.",
"She set about her preparations for the evening meal with more than usual speed.",
"Suddenly it occurred to her that she had heard no sound from their quarters for a long time.",
"Then she came over to him and drew his face close to hers.",
"One only passed so near that its absolute size could be judged by the marks upon its face.",
"In his day this was true, since it was impossible fully to repair the waste and physical wear and tear of the human frame.",
"The forests appeared to hide, though they do not of course actually approach, its lower edge.",
"It was rarely that, especially on returning from absence, I had sought any other company than hers.",
"I was anxious, of course, to see something also of its winter, and an opportunity presented itself.",
"Yet the sign could only have been given by a colleague.",
"Then it meant death for her to leap out.",
"His mother had given him birth, and by every tie he was mostly hers.",
"He knew that trail almost as well by night as by day.",
"Then he felt the old anger leap up.",
"Therefore, if he went at all she, too, was lost to the happiness that might have been hers.",
"It was not so light in there, but what light there was fell upon his face and left hers in shadow.",
"In the towns they searched every corner that was big enough to hide a man.",
"Bill collapsed in his seat.",
"Strange how they changed my soldier career, right at the start!",
"A soldier!",
"The soldier who is soon going away to fight and perhaps to die strikes hard at the very heart of a girl.",
"This opportunity to train for a soldier made a man of him.",
"The soldier raised his head.",
"I would never make a soldier like one of them.",
"He would not retire.",
"Through the dust he saw charging gray forms, thick and heavy.",
"That moment ended her weakness.",
"Women all would declare against that, and in fact would never believe.",
"And all the sooner if I can be with him more.",
"That moment was the end of me as a soldier.",
"His eyes held a look of the returned soldier who had never expected to see his native land again.",
"When they had made all the preparations the father and mother were invited to take tea with their married daughter, who lived in another part of the town and had been let into the secret.",
"It made us a little nervous, but we slept well enough after it.",
"I shall retire now.",
"He considers it perfectly safe under his bed.",
"I found that we were to have a great many passengers, including a more than usual number of ladies.",
"He says every day will have its excitement.",
"He drew further away, backing toward the front door.",
"She came to meet him, smiling her glad welcome.",
"He was very anxious.",
"He went on with his preparations.",
"Or had they followed his trail?",
"Hers was the victory.",
"And still they searched.",
"She saw him leap in and strike.",
"He was hers and she would not let him die.",
"Now, while he was still too weak to observe greatly what went on about him and while he slept most of the time, it was for her to be before him.",
"Then it would leap and strike.",
"He had them yet, his and hers.",
"Something which was tied across her shoulders.",
"It made my heart leap up with joy.",
"And how he got spotted was like this.",
"In his excitement he hardly knew what he was saying.",
"There was one large room in which the people cooked, ate, and slept.",
"There was a soldier in one place and an officer in another who asked for a drink.",
"He came to a village where there was considerable excitement going on.",
"All the time he was speaking, she kept touching me gently with her fingers.",
"She was very thin, and for several days after getting home she slept the most of the time.",
"I felt as if I could tear him to pieces.",
"The terrible sand drew him in almost to his shoulders, and he thought he was lost.",
"They slept at our feet and kept us warm.",
"I once shot one in the morning, carried him a long way on my shoulders, and started to skin him in the afternoon, when he turned around and bit me enough to draw blood.",
"She slept up stairs, and he down below.",
"See, there is just room enough for them to get under the fence.",
"I had several times run to a fire with the boys, and knew that there was always a great noise and excitement.",
"She draws near.",
"She extended hers also, but not to take his.",
"In every emergency it stands out by its strength or by its weakness.",
"The materials being different, the color and feel of them is different, and the resistance to wear and tear is different.",
"So what helps or hurts one, helps or hurts all.",
"What a suitable drive upon the whole matter would yield in happiness to the individual and dollars and cents to society, time alone will show.",
"Who knows but that we may find a chance to recover the gun again, sooner or later.",
"The gun may turn up again, sooner or later.",
"It looked just like the rest of the trail, and I never suspected a thing until I found myself going down.",
"I declare if I can stand this any longer.",
"These are all, however, secondary considerations.",
"Sooner or later we must come to some such arrangement.",
"Constant dropping wears the stone.",
"Thus to effect cause yields.",
"They threw pieces of stick for him to get, and he would swim out and bring them in in his mouth just like a dog, and then wait for more, all anxious like.",
"A couple of hours before they would have been carried right through on the flood, but when I looked down it was pretty calm there.",
"Just collapsed.",
"Very old ladies, who can not walk, certainly need money to make them comfortable and keep them so.",
"He passed slightly along before a considerable number, who sat in expectation.",
"Neither did he offer to retire from the field.",
"Read, smiling.",
"It was fitting.",
"They knew, without being told, that they should fire no more until at close quarters in some final rush.",
"He suffered the embrace for a few moments and then pushed her gently aside.",
"And they are all little ladies.",
"He remembered that last letter of hers that he had not answered.",
"I suppose his mother had hers last night.",
"His heart was more broken than hers.",
"How then will the history of the flood do that?",
"God sent a flood on the earth.",
"They thought of course that some one sent the flood.",
"But what kind of person must he be, thought they, who sent the flood?",
"It was true of the flood.",
"These are the strong things on which depend my fortune and my happiness.",
"The shoulders pushed forward and down.",
"He forgot that I might have somebody to send on his trail.",
"He never represents himself as a compound of strength and weakness.",
"She drew him to her till their shoulders touched.",
"He is crossing the street toward this house.",
"Then turning out his light he slept.",
"He approached her to kiss her gently, and with a fresh laugh she returned his kiss.",
"Then she pressed her hands to her eyes as if anxious to see nothing more.",
"But he simply set himself there, so near her that he touched her, looking and smiling at her the while.",
"I saw that she felt very anxious when I told her my own sad story.",
"Come and have a chat with me some day.",
"However, he at last had to tear it open.",
"Considerations of high finance are supposed to have been an important factor in it.",
"This is too ancient and too complicated to be even summarized here.",
"And shall I tell mine aunt?",
"Can make them yield, which will not fly for strokes.",
"But he could not tell why these schools would not do for these children of hers, he only knew that every school he thought of was impossible, but surely one could be found.",
"He had therefore been growing very fast, and would be sure to show it, sooner or later.",
"She would beat to pieces just where she lay, sooner or later, according to the kind of weather that might take the job in hand, and the size and force of the waves it should bring with it.",
"I declare!",
"Their leader at the polls became their leader in the preparations for that war.",
"Besides, it is not strong enough to prevent war in times of excitement.",
"After these arrangements had been completed we began preparations for the main advance in the following spring.",
"Such are, too briefly summarized, the experiments which have been made up to the present time.",
"The estimates prepared and accompanying the report of the consulting engineers were based on data less complete than are available at present.",
"There is usually one passenger train in either direction during the day, though between the larger cities this service has of late years been doubled.",
"In the ordinary way she would have slept thus all night.",
"What did he know of her happiness?",
"They were already at the foot of the slope.",
"In a certain sense, I hope it may be said of me that I am a lover of my species.",
"I had an aunt, a dear and good one.",
"But the common mother of us all in no long time after received him gently into hers.",
"How he went smiling to himself!",
"This gives them high importance in the eyes of the ladies.",
"The ladies were at church.",
"In fact, I had been sent often to the glass shop for small purchases so I was fairly familiar with the owner and the procedures.",
"I searched for symptoms of disease but found none.",
"I was meeting my aunt and cousins almost for the first time.",
"My aunt and family were pleased to see me and urged me to stay on for a few days.",
"That was quite an adventure in itself!",
"Generally males mature slower than females.",
"At this point there would be maximum excitement.",
"He is a great lover of modern terms.",
"It is natural for a lover to wish, that he might be any thing that could come near to his lady.",
"The attributes, to the demonstration of which the solution of this great question is necessary, have been demonstrated, without any solution, or by means of the solution of some former writer.",
"When an opinion has once become popular, very few are willing to oppose it.",
"That such a settlement may be of use in war, no man, that considers its situation, will deny.",
"This happy day has now arrived, somewhat sooner than it could be claimed.",
"I therefore rise now only to continue the common methods of the house, and to second a motion which I do not expect that any will oppose.",
"There are several considerations previous to the decision of this question.",
"Our excitement was great.",
"On the shore, there was no appearance of life, much less of trade and shipping.",
"And this he insists upon as a point of religion.",
"I then went to bed, and strange as it may seem, I think slept.",
"Flood thought differently.",
"Here the flood has passed over and marked everywhere its course by a smile.",
"But nothing sweet and fitting happened.",
"He should be removed by a slower process if the thing could as easily be arranged.",
"His difficulty seemed to have been similar to that experienced by the calling ladies.",
"I searched her face for some sign of consideration as she said this, but I was disappointed.",
"So she was anxious to begin her investigations at once.",
"Give it now, and enjoy the happiness it will make.",
"The latter may go a long way, but unless it has the former to support it, the chances are against it sooner or later.",
"He wears the colors of him he serves.",
"The expectation was quickly realized.",
"Mark, and the happiness of his subjects.",
"The result disappointed expectation.",
"At such moments she would declare her intention of never appearing in the world again.",
"The ladies declined dancing entirely, but appeared willing to throw away an hour in comments on their neighbors.",
"Death may part lovers, but not love.",
"Tear them off!",
"When will the flood clear, and the fish come on the feed again?",
"The foreign recruited service must necessarily be very highly paid.",
"It is a fitting description.",
"It does not fail to hurt the user if it also hurts the party against whom it is used.",
"He considers, not without some cause, that they have not played the game.",
"I wish to speak of all our leaders in terms of the greatest respect, but whatever respect we wish to pay them may not stop or arrest the progress of the country, and I am most anxious that the country at this very critical period of its history should make its choice.",
"Each of them seemed anxious to know everything I could tell about the other, and I would sometimes be subjected to embarrassing questions.",
"And now we must retire.",
"I have had far more experience in keeping out of battles than any other human being has had in the art of winning them.",
"I did not look back to see if the army were still on the road, nor did I ever know whether I had been searched for or had been forgotten.",
"Her ladies were informed that it would be very well for them to keep silent, and they understood her.",
"While I was doing this, and comparing the shape and size of the leaves with some drawings I had in a book which I took from my pocket, I heard a voice behind me and apparently above me.",
"As I stood for a few moments before this door, it suddenly opened, and in front of me stood a big soldier.",
"This was no sooner known, than boys and girls came in crowds, soon followed by many of their parents.",
"No one slept.",
"At last, becoming anxious about him, he went out to see what he was doing.",
"No dress but hers had such a flow as that.",
"He saw that quarters as comfortable as were possible were made for the men.",
"In the excitement of the moment he almost forgot himself.",
"He drew his chair a little closer to hers.",
"For almost the first time since he had taken up his quarters here, the lift had stopped outside.",
"I put my hands on her shoulders and I forced her back in the chair.",
"Whatever he was to know he must learn from her lips and from hers only.",
"He studied my every weakness.",
"All the magic of the place had passed away, its music seemed no longer to be singing happiness into his heart.",
"She knows which way her happiness lies.",
"His hands, which she held firmly in hers, were as cold as ice.",
"She held his hand in hers.",
"Careful examination revealed the cutting of the fence.",
"We took the trail that night.",
"So far, the experiment had succeeded beyond expectation.",
"The editor put his finger tips together.",
"They had always been hers.",
"The stream looked innocent enough and the crossing perfectly safe.",
"He was her lover, her official, absolute lover!",
"They hardly knew yet how they felt after the excitement of the night before.",
"He felt his knees start to give way.",
"It hurts me.",
"I am anxious to be understood.",
"The ice on the river was floating in huge pieces.",
"Then again he yields himself to his song of joy.",
"The sight of his weakness makes her strong.",
"We want to help our aunt.",
"She spoke so low and gently, that a person at the other end of the room could hardly have heard her words.",
"I had still, it seemed, some of the material out of which all worth of character, and all capacity for happiness, are made.",
"The only chance is to treat, not happiness, but some end external to it, as the purpose of life.",
"He was a lover of poetry and of most of the fine arts.",
"With regard to the thoughts, it is difficult to identify any particular part or element as being more hers than all the rest.",
"Still smiling, she opened it, as if to show him.",
"They tell me that they get them on the slope even earlier than this.",
"But she had no sooner got on top than she remembered that no time had been mentioned, or, if it had, that she had forgotten it.",
"She had lost both father and lover in one day!",
"The lover had been taken from her just as her father and her home had been.",
"His face grew red and his eyes fell before hers for a moment.",
"And our king shall judge us and go before us, and he shall fight our battles for us.",
"The work within him appeared to go on even while he slept, and that which had been a doubt, when he laid down to rest, would often hold the place of a truth, confirmed by some forgotten demonstration, when he recalled his thoughts in the morning.",
"The people, this wonderful people, had resigned themselves.",
"It appeared certain that the soldiers had searched several houses in the neighborhood.",
"The fallen soldier had remained on the ground.",
"Already a soldier and still a boy.",
"Suddenly these ladies turned their heads and saw me close to them.",
"Some members who lived in the more distant quarters had not been able to come to the meeting.",
"She discovered that her lover was not worth her husband.",
"And he draws back.",
"I was anxious to know what I ought to do.",
"I should be a bad chief, but I am a good soldier.",
"The preparations were completed on both sides.",
"He held his hand over his breast, where he had received a ball fired at close quarters.",
"Some of them slept.",
"They invented penalties.",
"The soldier brought to such a sorry pass as this is a sad sight.",
"He was smiling.",
"No sooner had he stepped on the street, however, than he was arrested.",
"He had many friends in the town, who no sooner learned of his arrest, than they began to appeal to the governor for his release.",
"Nor did any of them know where they were, nor why they had come, nor the long, long way that led back to where the trail began.",
"So said the trail.",
"These considerations naturally lead us to the subject of concentration.",
"This time I assumed the strongest mental attitude I could with the intention of sending out a flow through the right hand, and the result as compared with the previous one was remarkable.",
"He slept well for the first time in many weeks.",
"He recognized his own weakness, after a fashion.",
"She was smiling with the happy look of a girl.",
"It is just the place for lovers.",
"How I will tear it!",
"I will tear it.",
"There was a fine time generally, and all slept the sleep of the more or less just.",
"It was certainly spring now, and all was life and hope and happiness.",
"For himself he bought but a single thing, a picture of a woman with a neck like hers.",
"He was one of the strongest men in the valley.",
"It caught one of his legs, as he tried to leap aside, and broke it.",
"He liked adventure, but he was satisfied with the quantity for one afternoon.",
"It might as well be out and over the sooner.",
"Nor do I suppose he would know what that term implied.",
"My judgment in this case was the result of much anxious thought and consideration.",
"They were respected by all who knew them.",
"It even slept with him at night.",
"He slept by my side on a little bed of his own.",
"The desire of happiness, beyond all doubt, is a natural desire.",
"She has become anxious and troubled about many things.",
"What, then, are the conditions upon which true happiness depends?",
"How shall we oppose it?",
"Look for the path which has already led to safety and happiness.",
"It was a day dream of rare beauty, and he could not tear himself away from it.",
"He looked very anxious and excited.",
"He could nearly make it by jumping from rock to rock, he thought.",
"The mail bag he again suspended across his shoulders.",
"When they doubled, however, there was trouble.",
"This was the second day after his strange interview with his aunt.",
"He could look into a middle apartment crossing the entire house.",
"For the moment, all was excitement.",
"I knew that, sooner or later, it would come.",
"No sooner had she replied than he turned to me.",
"I know a family of children, lovers of games which involve running races.",
"What excitement there was!",
"Her mother gently took it from her.",
"This will do very well for those who know nothing of the matter personally, and who are anxious to listen to any excuse.",
"Is there any crowd or excitement here?",
"By this change of quarters my condition was a good deal improved.",
"Hers certainly seemed to.",
"What if it were hers?",
"He counted the strokes.",
"A flood of light filled the place.",
"He threw back his shoulders.",
"We asked the price without smiling, and the women, wondering, looked up.",
"He still respected her, was even grateful to her for what she had done.",
"The drama of the moment did not meet his expectation.",
"He had never before seen the weakness in her reaching out to strength.",
"He knew what he had to do and no doubt was already on the trail.",
"Her trail leads straight here.",
"It must have been only a few minutes after he completely collapsed that they found him.",
"In front of the fire they discussed probabilities.",
"Follow trail to camp.",
"The country was one where men had learned to look after hurts without much professional aid.",
"This the stained snow on the trail told them.",
"Another chapter of the long story of the trail was written here.",
"Sometimes they doubled across the track he had already made.",
"He had slept from one day into the next.",
"The drawings had already been sent over.",
"This is my lover.",
"Yet it was only by the strongest effort of will that I forced myself to open that letter.",
"If anything could have given me pleasure at that moment, it would have been to tear the letter in little pieces, with the writer looking on.",
"My knees seemed to give way under me.",
"The man seems so anxious not to be seen.",
"He advanced, smiling, as one advances to a friend of whose welcome one is sure.",
"There is peace and quiet when such is desired, and there is high adventure and excitement at other times.",
"But the shadow is totally aware and is anxious to remain active and useful.",
"But he can be taught how to aid it, and how to assure himself whether he is using it or not.",
"Each kind of character, each kind of representation, must be judged by itself.",
"There was no weakness visible.",
"They said of her that she slept with one eye open.",
"There was no excitement.",
"Which answer threw to me a flood of light on this whole science.",
"If so, the flood must have run in at the upper end, before it ran out at the lower.",
"Why she should say this so gently no one can tell.",
"She says everything gently.",
"He showed nothing but anxious concern, touched with regret, at his failure.",
"His look searched her face, but she hardly heard what he was saying.",
"It saved them trouble, they said, and possibly a slight wear and tear of feeling.",
"This building was separated from the other buildings by a fence.",
"I could see both engineers, one each side of me.",
"They saw that he was so anxious to learn that they promised to teach him every evening if he would slip out to their house.",
"The expectation in neither of these cases has been fully realized.",
"He would sometimes miss the fence entirely, the ball going out into the woods beyond.",
"Each time he would shoot I would have to run down to the fence to see how near he came to the mark.",
"The law was given me that if ever I was caught out in the public road again, by any soldier, I was to be shot.",
"They took us all back to the fence where I crossed over, all the others having been caught.",
"Great quantities of this preparation were used.",
"Anyway, he was on hand yesterday and quietly ran his film during the excitement of the rescue.",
"The photographs were so full of action that the participants now looked upon their adventure in a new light and regarded it far more seriously than before.",
"The opportunity presented itself sooner than she expected.",
"In this he succeeded perfectly, with the exception that just half of the arms were brought to the right, and the other half to the left shoulders.",
"Even a soldier may drop a tear over the dead body of his own father.",
"He fought in most of the principal battles of the war, and retired at the peace, with an excellent character.",
"And he has fought battles, they say.",
"Another hour, and she began to grow anxious.",
"A long absence is a dangerous experiment even for friends, much more for lovers.",
"Is not his love as much mine now as it ever was hers?",
"Should he show the journal to his aunt, or keep it to himself?",
"The slope was green and cool.",
"The head collapsed, but quickly came up again.",
"Some one must have judged me capable of wanting to take my own temperature.",
"He had slept.",
"Then he seemed suddenly to leap to the heart of the matter.",
"School must be out, and still the doctor slept.",
"I declare I never can find anything!",
"But the door had opened at once, letting out a flood of yellow light.",
"The nearest houses of any kind are over on the other side of the lake.",
"There is a trail around but it is absolutely out of the question, too far and too rough, even if we knew it, which we do not.",
"But I know the way and the trail is fairly good, or should be.",
"I consider it is as much my ring as hers.",
"She is my aunt and it is understood that all her things will come to me.",
"The little excitement had done her good.",
"That is why I am so anxious always to know if I read things right.",
"Any one of its hours might bring happiness again.",
"Her wide eyes searched his face.",
"The fitting went quickly forward.",
"She will find happiness yet.",
"Not hers, surely?",
"As she searched, she talked.",
"Next moment, head high and eyes smiling, she walked down to the gate.",
"It was at about that moment that the adventure which has been referred to occurred in the hotel kitchen.",
"Was it an asset, after all?",
"At length, however, a letter came engaging him for one evening.",
"An anxious silence was his answer.",
"I found it when I searched his room.",
"Wars will come sooner or later.",
"The same winter quarters are believed to be used year after year.",
"His head is very massive, and he stands high at the shoulders.",
"They followed his trail and passed him while he was standing there looking back, always looking up at the mountain.",
"The game trail was so close that he could jump right down on to it.",
"The future can be judged only by the past.",
"It was too sudden a vision of happiness to be realized at once.",
"The old man searched the country over for him.",
"I have been several times since then to look after his comfort and happiness.",
"The thought of one had always brought a picture of perfect happiness to his mind.",
"They went into a beautiful room, and she drew his chair so close to hers that she could hold his hands, and smooth his hair back now and then, and look down into his eyes as she talked with him.",
"The quiet stars looked down in peace upon him, the heart that beat within his breast was full with hope, with happiness, with calm content.",
"He hardly hoped to save both case and character, but he determined to make the strongest effort of which he was capable.",
"The excitement wore me out, and I had no such struggle as he had.",
"His journey had not been without its use, however, for it settled definitely the course he ought to take to reach the slope, and that, he thought, was a matter of no little importance.",
"While he slept his oil had burned out, and he was in total darkness.",
"He wondered how long he had slept, and what progress was being made, if any, toward his rescue.",
"He knew that he was still in the heading and that if he could but follow it he would, in time, reach the slope.",
"There was little that he could say to comfort and assure her.",
"But he remained very anxious and ill at ease.",
"He decided to try the one that led to the slope.",
"By and by it reached to his knees.",
"When he saw the contents he gave a sigh and a curious resigned expression came over his face.",
"My aunt had discovered that she had left it out.",
"I had slept ill.",
"He would have been laughed at, and not more respected, though less loved.",
"I went to the castle just about the time when I supposed the ladies would be retired from dinner.",
"The art of cooking plays a very important part in the matter of health, and thus of comfort and happiness.",
"The voluntary factor, as a means of regulating the heat loss in man, is one of great importance.",
"All bed clothing should be properly aired, by free exposure to the light and air every morning.",
"This should be done with the tips of the fingers or not at all.",
"At other times, a sharp blow between the shoulders will cause the substance to fall out.",
"If it is worry and not work that breaks down the mental and physical health of the well, how much more important is it that the minds and bodies of the sick should be kept at rest, free from worry and excitement!",
"A muscle which draws towards the middle line of the body, or of the hand or foot.",
"The whole city was anxious to know where they were.",
"A tear was the only answer.",
"Place it gently in this pool and watch for a few moments.",
"I declare, that was a fact.",
"I declare, he jumped!",
"The expectation of the future has been disappointed.",
"The claims of society and friends begin to be respected.",
"We carry happiness into our condition, but must not hope to find it there.",
"When the time drew near, she ran to meet her lover.",
"He went over the names of several beautiful girls that he had known, and said that beauty had never brought happiness to anybody.",
"Is it the ladies?",
"I can play the lover, too!",
"Flood, and myself.",
"They were very anxious to enter the camp, but this was not permitted.",
"The lady suspects him.",
"But more of their aunt and them, as I shall see more.",
"But I will retire.",
"What man, who has observed these things, either implied or expressed, in other families, would wish to be a husband!",
"I ought indeed to have written sooner.",
"Her bed had not been slept in.",
"Then she had closed the window and the bird was hers.",
"Day broke, and still mother and child slept on.",
"It has to be known sooner or later.",
"This I was told by my uncle and aunt, as I am going to call them.",
"There might have been a letter in it, but if there was it had been washed out in the flood and rain.",
"She turned about and looked toward the nearest house.",
"The man was now swimming with long, even strokes.",
"As soon as she was old enough her aunt began her religious training.",
"Her aunt was not in her room.",
"He searched for them for hours, going deeper and deeper into the forest than he had ever been before.",
"This was a different kind of happiness.",
"She felt so light that she was sure she was rising gently in the air.",
"See what it is to be a soldier.",
"They retire to the back of the stage.",
"It suddenly collapsed when the wind carried a full sound of music across the lake.",
"The event had every promise of happiness for her friend.",
"He held out his hand, and she put out hers.",
"She must go at once to her brother if she had to go to him on her knees.",
"After this was done, she invited all the ladies in the country to come to the festival.",
"This pleased the king, who searched throughout the land to make choice of a fitting place to raise so strong a keep.",
"Then the soldier fought his battles once again.",
"And so was hers.",
"There was no trail across this particular slide, and it did not present a dangerous appearance.",
"It was touch and go whether they would reach the trail and the bridge first.",
"And, as he went, he had a very strange adventure.",
"I am never anxious about an agent when I know him and can keep him watched.",
"She laughed again and let me down very gently.",
"I am considering the various probabilities merely in the abstract.",
"Let us consider the probabilities.",
"This he considers for some reason to be a highly significant fact.",
"Let us consider the probabilities in each case.",
"He claimed nothing but the right to speak his honest opinions, and the privilege to be judged according to the laws.",
"His promise was accepted, and when the day came there was a complete musical flood.",
"In the end he had to retire through ill health.",
"We make provision for the happiness of the adult.",
"There is nothing which he insists on more strongly, than the importance of fresh air.",
"Then he told her the whole adventure, and warned her, above all things, to keep it secret.",
"He took the body by the shoulders, and turned it on its back.",
"When proposals are made to change these institutions there are certain general considerations which should be observed.",
"I was free from any participation in that crime, and was anxious to meet the beautiful lady.",
"I searched much, but found the same nowhere.",
"Such was my state, and such was hers!",
"He was a short man, with broad shoulders and full chest, but otherwise slight.",
"She was in extreme excitement.",
"Still more important are the recent private purchases.",
"That night I never slept.",
"I will give the one nearest my heart.",
"The effect of this measure was far beyond my expectation.",
"Quantities of articles are arrested and prevented from entering.",
"Neither could he apologize for what he still thought was true.",
"The news flew through the town, producing intense excitement.",
"He was strong through the weakness of others, rather than in his own strength.",
"The place was hers, then.",
"He offered his services as a soldier, and they were declined.",
"Thus any word could be spelled out and any message sent.",
"Huge quantities of coal and other supplies were added.",
"But, vital as they are to its success, the, telephone art requires more than engineers and scientists.",
"I now went up the stream for a considerable distance, and found a trail that seemed to lead down to the margin of the river.",
"The session was one of unusual excitement.",
"The boy fixed his course toward the lowest length of fence.",
"These conditions are not normal, and sooner or later must change.",
"Favored in this beyond expectation.",
"Maintained for me a secret happiness.",
"Hers shall be closed.",
"Thus it came that she had known no home but the home of her aunt.",
"She knew her aunt too well to trust her with her secret.",
"Her manner implied a gentle protest.",
"The small space was easily searched.",
"Is it in those sounds of music ever floating in the air?",
"She draws a long breath.",
"All slept, or seemed to sleep.",
"It yields!",
"Could happiness be sad?",
"Not finding her, it settled again upon her aunt.",
"It would be excitement.",
"And this lover had refused to marry her?",
"With a last effort she tried to rush forward to take that leap below which would end all.",
"He is about to leap out and fly, when the warning hand of the lawyer is laid upon his arm.",
"She draws back.",
"I made all the preparations I could in case of disaster.",
"And we went through the different quarters of the city.",
"So anxious have they been to learn night schools have had to be established.",
"Thus ended in nothing all these promising preparations.",
"In this expectation he was disappointed.",
"The custom of the time permitted the soldier to carry his family with him to the field.",
"Aunt would be quite sure we should never see them there.",
"But take this smiling country as it stands.",
"And an animal is no sooner dead than a plant will convert it back again.",
"There will be a wooden bowl floating on the top.",
"I wonder we are not more respected.",
"Let them alone, and many will perhaps seek it for themselves, whom the world suspects not.",
"As I approached it, I heard it gently open and close, and saw a man steal away into the darkness.",
"The relative at whose house I had intended to stay was ill, so I sought other quarters.",
"Responding to a look he approached, smiling.",
"Their persons were then searched in turn, each by the second of the other.",
"He knew that she thought about things which were strange to him, and that she was anxious upon subjects which never troubled him.",
"The father slept below on the floor.",
"But no sooner were they out, than she began taking them in, in order to have them all under shelter for the night.",
"His idea was to make the sun go slower.",
"There was no stopping them until the trail became bad again, and then they stopped of themselves.",
"No sooner does the wind ease than the sea picks up.",
"Our hosts waited until we were done and then spread their table on the floor.",
"The house consisted of one large room, and it was given over to us, our hosts going elsewhere to sleep.",
"I searched with my glasses for miles, but could see no entrance.",
"And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to what they had done.",
"And what did I know of love and lovers, much less of marriage?",
"He was a true lover.",
"He was the one lover, once and always.",
"Just as she was finishing, she remembered more.",
"Such a trail!",
"Of course that is the principal interest, for ladies.",
"I thought he was excited, and yet he had not the appearance of excitement.",
"In this union alone, as we have already said, our happiness consists.",
"So far as those subjects are concerned on which we are most anxious to be informed, we are sure of nothing.",
"I was his first love, he was my first, and we were lovers to the end.",
"The ladies came to no conclusion.",
"It is not quite a fit on the shoulders.",
"I insist on being judged by my peers.",
"Returning to the house they noted the appearance of the snow on both sides of the trail its entire length.",
"Meanwhile the ladies were not having such a bad time, after all.",
"The ladies started back, but the chairman was equal to the occasion.",
"I shall come to the drawings next.",
"None of it is exactly funny, but some of it is smiling.",
"The fact draws my own portrait.",
"I should bear false witness if I did not declare life happy.",
"And anyway, is not excitement the proper reward of doing anything both right and a little dangerous?",
"I declare I can hear her speak.",
"To leap, jump.",
"To tell, declare, answer, say, speak.",
"Everywhere have the examples given by the highest ladies in the land been followed but too successfully.",
"They all declare that they merely require something external, in order to stand once more in the position which they regard as natural and happy in their own case.",
"And no sooner had he turned to her, than his whole face altered.",
"The aunt was now dead.",
"Then how are our ladies to reform this woman and her daughter?",
"We went to quarters with which I was familiar.",
"If one tells the truth one is sure, sooner or later, to be found out.",
"Nothing ages like happiness.",
"Where the buyers come from, and how a profit can be made, is a mystery.",
"They were very anxious to give, but when I desired to buy they said they did not wish to part with their things.",
"They spend all their gains upon it, and drink it in enormous quantities."],

["As I forced my way through, I thought I heard a sound of breathing.",
"For, perhaps a minute longer, she lay silent, breathing quickly.",
"The other breathing stopped.",
"But now, I no longer feared.",
"In the flash of a day, I saw that he slept, quietly, and I moved once more to my watching.",
"Then, like a flash, the solution of this extraordinary phenomenon revealed itself to me.",
"I cannot say that the house is, in any degree, less to be feared than the gardens.",
"The care and attendance is very good.",
"How wise their reasoning was time has shown!",
"There is a resolution which is concerned with crops.",
"Sweeping changes, in these last days, have come over the commercial, academic, and social world.",
"For the poet is the one who, in his own heart, holds all the meanings that words hold for the race.",
"Let him alone till he proves the worth of what he is about.",
"When we have solved this question, we shall have solved a great human problem.",
"But what boots it to complain of this now?",
"He did not need much pressing.",
"Without further delay I arose to my feet and set off into the darkness.",
"That empty shell of a past reputation was my only hope.",
"They arose without a word.",
"The entrance to the other was so narrow as to send a visitor to his knees.",
"Another minute and he had the tiny shell in hand.",
"The most powerful engines he regarded as toys.",
"Mix all well together and shape into rolls.",
"Add the beaten whites.",
"We now proceed to consider.",
"She turned very pale when I said this, and tears filled her eyes.",
"It did not take long for the whole horrible truth to flash across her.",
"He would always swear that he never had any hand in the accidents, and there was never any evidence against him that anybody could get hold of.",
"They were in the box in the pretty theatre.",
"Still, she had feared.",
"She had been far less reserved that evening.",
"While he was there a rather pretty pale girl, with rough red hair, was announced.",
"She was pale, but looked completely composed.",
"I saw a poor man whom they had beaten almost to death.",
"The people stuffed themselves with food until they became sick.",
"Here is my son wounded by the enemy.",
"She would have to go to them and persuade them not to fight.",
"They were often beaten.",
"In summer it requires but the late afternoon, with such borrowing of the night as is necessary for the journey home.",
"He still kept an office at the rear of the house, although he had given up the regular practice of the law.",
"But in the open part where the roof was highest, there was the theatre.",
"The theatre was empty as we entered.",
"At the end of this time he found it was impossible to proceed further along that course, and had to return to the place he had left and begin again.",
"I could only shake my body.",
"She drew back in a flash of something like surprise.",
"Quite a list of qualities, but they are there.",
"The first general complaint arose from the players who composed the membership of the smaller clubs.",
"She made a gesture to stay him, and by an effort seemed to shake off the threatening collapse.",
"As I waited for one there was, save for my own breathing, dead silence in the room.",
"In a flash the discovery gave me an idea.",
"All the same it seemed as though she almost feared to ask the result, and he was the first to speak.",
"Nothing, however, could persuade mother to change her determination.",
"At last they had come so near that I saw that I must abandon my horse.",
"The coach was backed out, when the running gear was found to be as good as ever.",
"I was curious to see how I would look when represented by some one else, and of course I was present on the opening night, a private box having been reserved for me.",
"Lecture committees know this.",
"It was all over in a flash.",
"The engines had started up again, and they were going on.",
"I reversed our engines and went up to talk to the pilot.",
"I am not wounded, go to bed again.",
"I fail to see that proves anything in particular.",
"These houses do not appear to have been used for some time past, and are almost in ruins.",
"But in the matter of food the positions were reversed.",
"He went out of his way to be kind to all prisoners, especially if sick or wounded.",
"Some more farther back were wounded.",
"Out came a huge photograph.",
"Some one must have taken a good deal of trouble to secure this photograph.",
"Then a cry came and a noise of hard breathing.",
"He had a heavy pale face, without hair on it.",
"I fell back to the rear, for if we were to escape I thought there might be need of fighting there.",
"We were beyond the pale, and must face the consequences.",
"The blood mounted to her head.",
"For very soon questions arose in her heart.",
"They were but accidents of the way.",
"They told me that the boy had been pale for some time, with a scared look.",
"But he was not angry, which I had feared he would be.",
"So did this famous hunt proceed!",
"Besides, their backs were towards me.",
"He was beaten, on that point at least, and owned it.",
"By the side of the sheet and the piece of carpet there was an old brown leather bag.",
"Authors are not agreed as to the date of the first traces of this old custom.",
"It is of obligation to observe both orders.",
"Yes, there is such an obligation.",
"Later writers find other meanings for the name.",
"But scholars reject this theory.",
"Shake hands, my boy!",
"The ideal of scientific teaching is, no doubt, a system by which the scholar sees every fact for himself, and the teacher supplies only the explanations.",
"The resistance of living matter to heat is known to vary within considerable limits, and to depend, to some extent, upon the chemical and physical qualities of the surrounding medium.",
"We shall be across in no time and take the enemy in the rear.",
"It would have been victory to our flag if the poor old follow had been wounded before the action began.",
"I will see that the prisoner does not get out.",
"They had guides waiting on the bank of the river.",
"The operators are raw and some of them can barely read.",
"He wrote as though he had no idea that he had been virtually a prisoner.",
"And pretty soon he up and cleaned out of camp.",
"Animals fight, as a rule, just as well on their backs as they do on their feet.",
"There was another sigh and another shake of the head.",
"Not dead, unfortunately, but slightly wounded.",
"On the whole it was not a large crowd, but what it lacked in size it made up in intense interest.",
"It was impossible for him, in that condition, to grow pale.",
"His heavy breathing was the only sound.",
"They were both pale now.",
"There was nothing to gain by attacking him.",
"He followed her without a word, and since she led the way she was able to relax her expression for a necessary moment.",
"I had no need to read the article which followed, for I saw in a flash what had occurred.",
"Then all at once she laughed, with a flash of white teeth.",
"Some clothing put out a few days before to be cleaned and pressed was ready for delivery.",
"He saw that it was planted in wet ground.",
"Some he could persuade to be good.",
"It is carried in war when one side sends a message to the other.",
"But his stuffed birds did not please him.",
"But when he tried to paint a picture of a bird, it looked worse than his stuffed birds.",
"There were many sick and wounded soldiers to be taken care of.",
"But how different the matter stands when we consider meanings!",
"They are words that have similar meanings.",
"In a few minutes he would get the signal to stop his engines.",
"I bring up the rear in my red coat.",
"He never had feared to meet his eye before.",
"The words stopped in his throat.",
"Killed and wounded.",
"Crops are not grown on order.",
"Equipment of the army was obviously the first and pressing obligation.",
"She was getting the wounded as they came down from the front.",
"Her man could not be beaten with her at his back.",
"And yet in their own case they are entirely reasonable, and ask no favors.",
"Governments now know that there must be no just cause for complaint in the family at the rear, if the man at the front is to be fully effective.",
"She looked very pale and her face was cut, but she and everyone else was calm.",
"There he was made a prisoner.",
"Have the man forward see if he can pick up the craft with his flash.",
"The great engines stopped and became silent.",
"Fully half the men there were killed or wounded so badly that they could fight no more.",
"To the other this seemed good reasoning.",
"But he could not hear anyone breathing.",
"He was sure the prisoner was the man he had seen.",
"The prisoner might be guilty and he might be innocent.",
"It might mean that, but it might mean only that they were not satisfied that the prisoner had committed the murder.",
"The visitor did not immediately reply.",
"She returned to her visitor, who was sitting with her face buried in her hands.",
"But when the case came before the police court and the police produced their evidence, it was seen that there was a strong case against the prisoner.",
"He declared that the prisoner made no remark when arrested and did not seem surprised.",
"He identified the stick produced in court as the one which the prisoner had been carrying on that day.",
"The evidence which he intended to call would show that for years past very friendly relations had existed between the prisoner and the murdered man.",
"In fact he was grateful to his learned friend for doing so, for it had released him from a promise extracted from him by the prisoner not to make any use of the matter in his conduct of the case.",
"He was certain that no shot had been fired inside the house from the time the prisoner entered the house until he left.",
"The matches I carried in my pocket would make this possible if once I heard him breathing.",
"But she had claims to consideration, which he lacked.",
"Were the marks very plain upon her throat?",
"The prisoner was an innocent man, in his eyes.",
"I had not taken the key to the front door, because I knew of a window I could shake loose.",
"The prisoner was silent.",
"I arose.",
"Without a thought of what I was doing, my hands closed round her throat.",
"Should he leap at her white throat?",
"He saw the man running forward, pale as death.",
"They had beaten him time and again until he was almost dead.",
"She was pale.",
"In a flash he turned.",
"He brought with him plenty of paper, a camera and the photograph of a girl.",
"He was still breathing hard.",
"When they came to the kill he was the first to leap at its soft throat.",
"They had few rivals.",
"In the rear followed mothers and children.",
"The second was as he had planted it.",
"She was breathing a little quickly.",
"His enemy dead, he flies at him and cuts his throat.",
"When he had nearly arrived a dust arose.",
"She arose to separate them.",
"As they lacked salt, they went to purchase it.",
"Then like a flash came to me that which I should have suspected before!",
"I could see that one of the posts had been carried away by the ball, but whether or no the prisoner was killed could not be told from so great a distance and while he was surrounded by such numbers.",
"They proceed no further.",
"The following striking effects are known to proceed from this simple cause.",
"She cannot live on her resources with her enormous capital in ruins.",
"Then he took out several more pieces, and cleaned them all.",
"Then he arose and walked slowly to his quarters, and I saw him no more that night.",
"Indeed, it was during that winter that we formed the warm attachment which still continues.",
"Quick as a flash, I fired and brought down another.",
"His head had fallen back, his eyes were closed, and from his deep and regular breathing I knew that he was sleeping.",
"Another shake.",
"Yet traces of the other tradition remain.",
"The mounted men had had a busy time.",
"The wind was strong and drove walls of water before it, and there was not a man in the attacking force with a dry skin.",
"The physical powers of some of our attacking troops were tried highly.",
"We try many men here, and reject a good few.",
"No visitor would hear anything of it.",
"When anyone falls out, he is kicked and beaten till he gets up again.",
"Was it because he feared to again meet me?",
"If I had but a photograph to show people it would give me a great advantage, but I had nothing.",
"Next second, however, I held my breath, and I think I must have turned pale.",
"These and other thoughts ran through my mind in the silence that followed our heated argument, for I saw well that he was in actual fear of me.",
"It was just as I had feared.",
"Some words probably arose, when my father again turned and left.",
"Hence much trouble arose.",
"All escaped except one, who was wounded in the left breast.",
"He had soon again to abandon them.",
"The carpet was green with a red figure.",
"And so he began to lecture.",
"That proves that politics have been reduced to a fine art.",
"Or is it because they cannot help reasoning in a circle?",
"But, still hoping to win it back, they do not shell it heavily or often.",
"Then a few seconds later we heard the next shell coming.",
"This was the signal that the attack had been beaten off and that the situation was quiet again.",
"One day I saw a shell go clean through the roof of it, but there was no one inside at the time.",
"He collapsed on the floor, and was convinced for a couple of minutes that he had been hit, and for some time after that he was suffering from shell shock.",
"And then I watched his breathing.",
"The position was a mass of shell holes.",
"His face was growing pale already, as only the faces of the dead are pale.",
"The fact that I am here tonight proves I am usually successful.",
"I knew the road well enough, which was fortunate, even when we turned off the beaten track over a trail which was hardly as good as a foot path.",
"Somehow I feared we might be too late, though I knew that this was hardly possible.",
"I feared, and yet I knew well enough it was written somewhere that we should meet once more.",
"The visitor explained.",
"She was pale and nervous.",
"Thus, he held a secure observation post both in front and rear of the hotel.",
"After a victory his chief thoughts were for the wounded.",
"For now the enemy was attacking the place with greater spirit and activity than ever.",
"A little child proves that all I say is true, and that it knows that all I say is true.",
"Now it happened that a violent dispute arose between them.",
"A shake of the head.",
"Complaints apart, proceed we to our task.",
"My poor father was slightly wounded, and I am left to take care of him and my aunt.",
"As I have not spoke to her about it, I can easily reject the idea.",
"It came in boots, too, which I took as a favor.",
"Now and then the weekly visitor comes to the door of a house where he has regularly called.",
"He was a man who had few needs, only the knowledge that his crops were bringing happiness to others.",
"The attendance at the services now increased so as completely to fill the rooms.",
"The friends of both parties hoped that it might be otherwise, and that nothing would come of this attachment.",
"She hardly seemed to be breathing.",
"Another of the little incidents that are only half forgotten.",
"It is to be feared that he made neither an interesting nor a romantic story of it.",
"They did not shake hands.",
"There is some one at their backs.",
"She did not seem to be breathing.",
"She did not attempt to persuade.",
"How strong the river rolls!",
"One of them deserves remembering for its own sake.",
"In a moment she pulled herself together, and observed that there had been enough talk about a mere visitor.",
"My dear man, we must shake on that.",
"Cleaned up?",
"A visitor with eyes and ears could come to his own conclusions.",
"He was hearing what sometimes he had feared he might not last long enough to hear.",
"The pale face showed its pain, but was still and silent.",
"The prisoner now spoke for the first time.",
"She gave him back his look, turning pale.",
"The theory and philosophy of this process we will, therefore, explain, and then proceed to show the practical course to be adopted.",
"There are several varieties.",
"After the sweeping she should leave the room, shut the door, and proceed to lay the breakfast.",
"A bedroom should be cleaned like this every week.",
"But, whether night or day, the same food should never be heated twice, and what the child leaves should be thrown away.",
"The face is pale, and has a very anxious look.",
"It may seem strange that this discovery should have been reserved for the crisis of a battle.",
"This we think we have shown cannot be done by reasoning founded on the early history of the games under consideration.",
"Fancy had all night been busy, combining her old and new materials into many a wild shape.",
"He never fights that way.",
"Apparently she was very calm, but I had never seen her face so pale.",
"The visitor turned to go now, as it seemed not worth her while to waste words about it.",
"Breathing deeply, he ran in and his mother met him at the door.",
"Since all her brothers and sisters liked the visitor so much, it was not easy to get her off alone.",
"The above photograph shows the gun train complete, ready for transportation.",
"The supporting waves advanced over the bodies of the dead and wounded.",
"We then began to collect our wounded.",
"Hunt wounded.",
"Entering the city and turning into his street the officer saw the first house was in ruins.",
"The wounded began to come in.",
"These were caught and mounted by civilians glad to have so rapid a mode of escape.",
"I expressed to him my wonder at the few wounded.",
"The wounded!",
"She showed him a pair of boots.",
"These have mostly been broken by shell fire.",
"My horse was wounded and the others were too far in the rear.",
"There was time to think of nothing but getting out the wounded.",
"Such a hospital exists in this neighborhood in the building of a normal college, where every corner is used in housing wounded men.",
"Every man was seriously wounded.",
"If these provisions of international law are lived up to, the lot of the prisoner of war is not so hard as many people have been led to believe.",
"He did not abandon them then.",
"Now and then a shell found its mark, but it left us absolutely cold as to its effect on each man at a time like this.",
"Is he wounded?",
"Is he taken prisoner?",
"We are like a vehicle on the top of a hill, which, the moment it is pushed beyond the point of resistance, rolls down of itself, without the aid of horses.",
"From their general tone, I cannot persuade myself that he ever truly loved her.",
"I feared to make either sound or motion.",
"Look at his throat!",
"He removed his rivals from court, and put in their places his own creatures.",
"He now feared that his power was at an end, yet he resolved to have an interview with his cousin.",
"This touched his national pride, and he gave me something not unlike a lecture.",
"We are careful for the rights of minorities.",
"We have not solved them all.",
"Our capital wealth is greater, and so are our powers of borrowing.",
"I would also recommend that a photograph of the author be placed at the head of every article.",
"I wounded him, and I took him, and where I go he goes.",
"It modified his choice of subjects, and slightly colored their interpretation, without causing him to abandon the classical attitude.",
"What ship ever by itself either wounded or killed anybody?",
"We must draw attention, however, to protests raised by certain minorities against some of the ideas and practices which had been definitely adopted by the majority.",
"In a few days he let them out again, and watched them with a pale face.",
"No traces of her crew were to be seen.",
"But that obligation also is at an end.",
"I reserved this examination for a second opportunity, which, as it happened, never occurred.",
"We all left the room, closing the door upon the prisoner.",
"Permit me to emphasize the facts which characterize our attitude.",
"She can afford to wait till her allies are beaten and then take over their business.",
"We gave up counting the days and fights, for every day has its battle.",
"This was no ordinary visitor.",
"Then came a white flash, a sharp report.",
"The father laughed again and slowly mounted the stairs.",
"His face was pale and his mouth set.",
"That seemed to shake him.",
"The leader cleared his throat as if he had much to say, but he did not speak.",
"He was too weak to shake hands.",
"Our boat rolls heavily and many boys are already sick.",
"By words alone he had understood this shell thing.",
"The broad, brown flash of his face was reality.",
"That established his identity as a wounded soldier brought home from the war.",
"These men, particularly the scientist, lacked something.",
"He fights them.",
"She had set the date, but had reserved the pleasure of telling him.",
"As I could not understand a word, it seemed to me like a theatre.",
"As the professor came in I went towards him, and asked him if I might attend his lecture.",
"His face was in shadow, yet I was quite aware of the flash of his eyes.",
"They exhibited no flash of recognition.",
"No occasion to call him arose during my watch.",
"Satisfied with my mission, and confident nothing more need be said, I arose to my feet.",
"A theatre, dance, a ride through the park.",
"King knew then in a flash that she had not expected him, that probably because he had never answered her letter she had forgotten all about it.",
"In the city they would have turned their backs and walked away from each other.",
"How she feared to follow him!",
"He drew on his boots and went to look out.",
"She could hear him breathing.",
"If these qualities, however, are present with it, it will not be the one.",
"Just as it is all other things which proceed from it.",
"She could not trust herself to shake hands, or even look at him.",
"The only trees we have I planted.",
"They locked me in my room at night, and treated me like a prisoner.",
"A company of people had come over from the theatre, some one was calling to her outside her door, asking her if she would come down.",
"They were under no obligation to protect the woman or her boy.",
"Then, while the body of the dog was supported, he carefully pressed his feet on the soft path, so as to leave a distinct impression, and convince any who should examine the trail that it was not the dog who had been wounded.",
"All the white men came forth, for, though many of them were wounded, not one had fallen.",
"All fell, but some were not wounded.",
"When her father tried to rescue her he was shot, and her mother was seriously wounded.",
"He was very hot, and was breathing fast, but his manner was as cool as if he had never left the group about me.",
"On sweeping days we worked very hard, and enjoyed the fun.",
"Now that they were gone my head was stuffed up all the time.",
"Some of their legs seemed sticking straight out behind.",
"And all the time that strange live thing kept sticking up its head and putting out its tongue at me, and neither of them noticed it.",
"Over this he could run easily, and they would have to feel their way along, for after he had gone around the circle a few times, he would jump from the beaten path as far as he could, and make off to other cover in a straight line.",
"If only wounded, they went after him with all speed.",
"He made a motion in the direction in which the late visitor had disappeared.",
"That neck and throat!",
"She approached a different door from that by which she had entered, her eyes in all directions and her heart in her throat.",
"She arose.",
"She was very pale.",
"He mounted and started away.",
"It will be fair reasoning to argue thus.",
"That would at least be reasoning from the known to the unknown.",
"It is a very good example of reasoning from the known to the unknown.",
"Now apply the same reasoning to coal.",
"But is the problem solved?",
"Shell shock is now acknowledged to belong to this group.",
"There is an element of speed in judgment on reasoning as in perception and memory.",
"Nervous is a word of many meanings.",
"Varieties of the human race exist as do varieties of dogs.",
"The prisoner must have got loose!",
"Hardly had he spoken before there came a brilliant flash.",
"When the meal was finished he arose, and picked up his gun.",
"I yield myself a prisoner of war.",
"We may want to relax an old association in order to make a newer and wider one.",
"He that fights and runs away may live to fight another day.",
"After he got it all on and fixed right, he stuffed his old clothes into the place and locked it up again.",
"So that proves it.",
"However, the door was locked and she was a prisoner.",
"The present match had been long upon the carpet, and was a very considerable one in point of fortune.",
"Then they fell in at the rear of the line.",
"He grew very pale.",
"They listened, breathing short.",
"I have made my will, remembering a number of people, and if they die before I do, I shall keep trace of their children.",
"She did not appear to suffer, she lay very still, recognizing us, but not speaking even when we spoke to her.",
"My route is not all mapped out for me yet.",
"They were set in a sort of park, with the road running in front and a river in the rear.",
"He was a fair scholar, but his mind was constantly on the subject of what to wear and how to wear it.",
"Then he ran around a corner of a building, mounted the steps to a side door, and disappeared from view.",
"Then he led the way through the crowd to where some seats were reserved.",
"As they did so they heard a noise at the rear of the place.",
"His throat seemed to be on fire.",
"They stood with the wind taking them with its teeth and pressing them heavily back.",
"And always he worked with a sort of nervous anxiety as though he feared that he might not be doing enough.",
"She looked him up and down and reserved judgment, it seemed.",
"It covered the carpet and furniture and pictures.",
"But a final difficulty arose.",
"For a moment, indeed, he feared that he might lose her.",
"And when night had fallen she no longer admitted any visitor until she knew his name.",
"He had, in fact, been beaten for the second time.",
"And as soon as the coffee was served no end of questions arose on every side, and he had to speak out.",
"And they have been assisted in this by a genuine and increasing desire for peace in the nation.",
"What has it accomplished when it sends the child to the primary school?",
"How, rear the town?",
"I should rear a town, should I not!",
"Shall I shake hands?",
"I have no prisoner.",
"What followed was all over in a flash, but it was seen by many witnesses.",
"Like his master, he was not proud, but took a wide view of life, so that all varieties of it came within his field of vision.",
"The society found itself in the position that no promise must be allowed to stick in the throat.",
"She had never lacked money, and had sufficient now for her needs.",
"The lives of men and women had gained depth and meaning in a flash of thought.",
"The rear ranks were still coming round the corner.",
"They had lost but few men and half a dozen wounded were left behind in the village.",
"She would not relax in her demand.",
"It is no new observation, I believe, that a lover in most cases has no rival so much to be feared as the father.",
"I wait till people have done borrowing them.",
"But, strange to say, even here a theatre cannot be supported for more than a few weeks at a time.",
"He made me write a few lines about each photograph.",
"In attempts of this kind many accidents happen which cannot be heard without surprise.",
"I am asked, whether it is not the chief question at the bar of our courts of justice, what is the character of the prisoner?",
"Their varieties and amount of population are equally unknown.",
"We passed the ruins of several towns and other remains.",
"The town is clean, but many houses are in ruins.",
"I cannot yet persuade myself that I have made much progress in recovery.",
"It is feared that he will recover.",
"She made me feel that our understanding was secret and our attachment romantic.",
"Yet only with the greatest difficulty could I persuade her to let me share the watch that must be kept over him.",
"It seemed like borrowing trouble to look still farther into the future, but the vision was striking.",
"I am beaten now, in this game that seemed easy up to the very last moment.",
"West gave a start and half arose.",
"Hard luck, old boys, but we are full and must save the worst wounded first.",
"From this point he mapped out his own campaign.",
"Soon I had reason to know that she played the game, and stayed only in order to work to help the prisoners of her own people, and our wounded too.",
"For any day her husband might want help from us or might be brought in wounded to our hospital, where she could nurse and tend to him herself.",
"The only time he sees the men is when they are wounded.",
"Who could tell their pressing need in months to come?",
"The prize had been awarded by the state, and the whole affair had somewhat of an official and political character.",
"But in order that the narrative may proceed regularly, it is fit that we should return a little in the order of time.",
"A secret sign caused the secretary to proceed with his duty.",
"I have just had a visitor.",
"The prisoner made no reply.",
"He arose, crossed himself, and advanced as far as the chains permitted, to do him honor.",
"He was either too reserved or too proud to offer services which were not required.",
"Our hero feared he had gone too far, and tried to turn the subject off.",
"We assisted them.",
"Regarding the leaving of civil employment, no danger is feared, because no one will leave his employment, unless he is in a position to find support for himself and family either through friends or otherwise.",
"He fired on the backs of the people who were in flight.",
"All the time we were talking he and my scholar were looking at each other, and each of them seemed entirely satisfied with the survey.",
"Then I covered it up, pressing the earth firmly down into the hole.",
"The last public meeting in this place was held in silence, which might probably be the cause of a small attendance on this occasion.",
"Their chief service in this city was a public meeting, at which there was a large attendance.",
"He is assisted only by native teachers.",
"They lacked science.",
"Her feet were firmly planted upon the ground.",
"The car had stopped outside the theatre.",
"Then I remember thinking that whatever happened, whatever price I had to pay, I must stand upon the stage of that theatre and win.",
"Nevertheless, when he tried to speak his throat was hard and dry, and at the second attempt he began instead to laugh.",
"The car had stopped before the entrance to the theatre.",
"When I arrived at the theatre this morning I found that it was to be a permanent job all right, and there was a little advance for me waiting in an envelope.",
"She began to shake once more upon her feet.",
"The theatre is packed every night.",
"They waited until the theatre was half empty before they left their seats.",
"A few pale lights were still burning along the river way.",
"We expected a large attendance, and were not disappointed.",
"A full attendance warned her that her scholars expected something interesting to happen.",
"I wanted to refuse, but the words stuck in my throat.",
"The most pressing need of my nature at that moment was a square meal.",
"He picked up an old photograph album, and began to turn over its pages.",
"He looked so pale and thin that I thought for a moment his old enemy had attacked him.",
"I saw, far down, a flash of blue.",
"He had no stomach for economies, and observed no rules.",
"That man had been called to another account, and the prisoner was left to bear the consequences of his association with him.",
"She was quite content to enjoy the fresh air of the morning, the changing scenes through which they passed and the easy motion of the horse on which she was mounted.",
"Neither spoke of the incidents of the previous day.",
"In a flash it all came to him.",
"Later, the decision of the judges awarded me the first place.",
"A tall, strong man arose.",
"And it is to be feared that they will retain that value a long time.",
"It was as if a flash of light had revealed it to me.",
"For some time past I have feared my father was in trouble.",
"Its little face was pale, and its eyes were closed.",
"This species of crime is subject to such accidents.",
"The law being made prisoner, this man felt himself set free.",
"The judges turned pale.",
"Let the call to arms be beaten.",
"This arose from the fact that they ran greater danger.",
"It feared nothing.",
"The most active mounted first.",
"The faces were pale, but in every eye could be seen the same firm resolution.",
"But here the same question arose.",
"A woman with a child in her arms could not be a very terrible visitor, and she was allowed to enter.",
"Would they abandon themselves?",
"His brother wounded!",
"Strange incidents took place.",
"A wounded man on entering had probably placed his hand on the table on the spot where the newspaper lay.",
"He was pale.",
"I felt the little girl pressing herself against my legs.",
"I am taking care of the wounded.",
"They went back, carrying the wounded man.",
"It is not all this that is wanted, it is a shake of the hand between brothers!",
"And then he kept at a distance from the prisoner.",
"They had more pressing work on hand.",
"What it lacked at certain points in order to make it perfectly dark they added.",
"It was a prisoner.",
"What would have killed another nation has hardly wounded her.",
"It also differs in its characters.",
"When the throat is found by the mother to be early affected, an immediate application to the medical adviser is especially important.",
"He ran to him and assisted him to rise.",
"He arose, took his gun and went out among the hills.",
"Something seemed to rise in his throat and cut off his speech.",
"Yet in his face he sends his tale before him.",
"On their backs?",
"He wanted to go home, but feared to do so.",
"Her throat was white and soft.",
"I can see its white throat again.",
"He was disappointed, but there were traces of her recent presence.",
"He questioned the visitor.",
"He arose in the morning a more or less dangerous human being.",
"That is enough to say to any one who understands the situation.",
"It is not related on that account, however, but simply in consequence of its remarkable incidents.",
"However, be that as it may, in this case there was no evidence against the prisoner, unless his counsel made it so.",
"I was never hard on a prisoner.",
"She was anxious not to bring another child into the world, and had some communication with the prisoner on the subject.",
"I am now quite certain that no sentence can be properly awarded unless after such consideration.",
"The deal was made, and I left the theatre with the largest sum of money I had ever made all at once.",
"I recalled later that I cleaned up my desk and put away a number of things, as though I were going away for some time.",
"At some little distance there was the corner of something white sticking up out of the sand.",
"He moved about presenting a difficult barrier against easy capture.",
"The audience arose in their seats.",
"When he reached home it was by way of the rear fence.",
"Otherwise there would have been no carpet, for the sand was hard and dry.",
"Seeing me standing there, some of them turned pale, others grew red with emotion.",
"My visitor at once collected her toys and prepared to go.",
"To aid them in this there are books in quantities and of qualities not even imagined by the children of a few generations ago.",
"But this prisoner says he did it for gain.",
"This prisoner I never saw till I came from a sick bed into this court, when I met him for the first time.",
"But shall this prisoner be allowed to take advantage of his own wrong?",
"Flat faces, big faces, red faces, pale faces!",
"He arose.",
"Every thought, every emotion centered around it.",
"He waited, breathing hard.",
"During that time he half thought he had another visitor but was not sure.",
"The visitor started to go.",
"They are all naturally heated.",
"Too late the flash of white teeth warned him.",
"His eyes never left the man who had beaten him.",
"He was wounded.",
"He might be sick or wounded or dead.",
"His eyes bored into those of the prisoner.",
"The real attack would come from the rear.",
"His anger could not shake their decision.",
"And once, in the stress of battle, she had wounded him while he was attacking.",
"Some one or something had been killed or wounded here.",
"The girl brought up the rear.",
"They made slow progress, for the pace had to be regulated to suit the prisoner.",
"They watched their prisoner a little closer.",
"On the other side of the fire lay the prisoner.",
"He made breakfast for the prisoner and himself.",
"He found the first one dead, the other badly wounded.",
"At the theatre.",
"And my fingers were wet, as I knew my boots must be.",
"There was a photograph of this window, taken from outside.",
"But they feared me.",
"I am feared by all, and I fear nothing!",
"But this much may be said of all descriptions which proceed upon details.",
"He affected to have no taste for the arts, and he certainly took but little pleasure in the examination of the ruins.",
"Persuade him to it.",
"It is with the working of the last passion, fear, that this lecture has to do.",
"We have come to them by no theories, no dreams of the fancy, but by plain honest reasoning, from plain honest facts.",
"Yet, as he waited, he could not keep his eyes from this photograph.",
"Crops could not touch ours.",
"It was exactly like looking at his photograph.",
"His manner, it mounted too.",
"Many of them, it is reported, followed those who were coming to the island, but being too lazy to proceed, turned back when they were got half way.",
"The food was too heavy for these children, and they were nearly always in need of some medical attendance.",
"When the first flash of feeling had passed I spoke, calling him by name, and he addressed me as brother.",
"For answer she assisted him to rise.",
"The boy grew pale and then red.",
"As his visitor entered he looked up in surprise and laid down the instrument.",
"He demanded the immediate release of the prisoner.",
"The visitor laughed, showing a beautiful row of small white teeth as she did so.",
"As soon as this point was settled, there arose the question of the proper guide.",
"She became pale as death, and pressed her hand upon her heart, as if to still its beating.",
"Her dress was dark, and left little liability to exposure.",
"Above them stood the prisoner.",
"The next day the prisoner was not at the window, nor the next day, nor the next.",
"She must take no notice of the prisoner, she was given to understand one day, if she was to remain in the garden while he walked there.",
"The prisoner again looked out of the window.",
"It was worse than she had even feared.",
"I sometimes think she sees the whole of her life mapped out before her, and takes up every event in order.",
"The largest attendance of any in the county.",
"But this train of reasoning never lasted long.",
"The voice of the visitor suddenly returned.",
"She was breathing quickly.",
"I thought he looked as pale as a plate.",
"But of course one understands.",
"I thought, I hoped that if things were as I feared she would tell me herself, but she never has.",
"But it proves my point, I think.",
"And her little pile of proof mounted higher day by day.",
"Some of her plans were fantastic to a degree, but she always had sense enough to reject them in the end.",
"Did her hand shake?",
"She feared she knew not what.",
"She could not abandon her cat.",
"The quiet opening of a door close by made him lift his eyes from the carpet.",
"There was no longer any problem, any difficulty about that photograph.",
"The result was that which was feared and predicted by his colleagues.",
"The man came upon a bear, which he shot and badly wounded.",
"Soon she headed down the mountain side, paying absolutely no attention to the big male, which slowly followed some distance in the rear.",
"Every man might treat his own prisoner, be it man or woman, after his own fashion.",
"Shake her up!",
"There are cold joints below.",
"One turned pale.",
"Then he came back, sat down in front of his visitor, and assumed an attitude of confidence.",
"An hour later they came down to the city on the train which brought the wounded passengers.",
"He feared that the good man would be worried on account of his long absence.",
"He feared that he was either sick or in deep trouble.",
"It lacked half an hour of that time now.",
"The men in the car arose from their seats and went out to discover the cause of the alarm.",
"There was but one theory, however, on which he could hope to introduce evidence of all that had taken place there, and he feared that that was not a sound one.",
"He arose to reply.",
"He was tired and was breathing heavily.",
"He arose and opened the door.",
"As the boy passed on he recalled the incidents of the former journey.",
"Then he arose and went down the chamber.",
"After a time he arose again, but in the intense darkness and with that strange confusion in his brain, he could not tell in which direction to go.",
"The emergency that called for its use soon arose.",
"The boy was living, breathing, talking.",
"He tried to answer their call, but the cry stuck in his throat.",
"I went to the telephone and fixed up an appointment with a specialist.",
"It was attacking a man who would not beat them, because his beating them would make them live the longer.",
"We were well mounted, and had not many miles to ride.",
"I wonder any man alive will ever rear a daughter.",
"In any case no question of divided interests ever arose.",
"Her face was very pale as she gave him the letter.",
"When does a visitor ever come here except on business?",
"She had removed all traces of tears from her face, and, though she was still very pale, she was quite composed, and ready to smile at them both.",
"Why is breathing so essential to our life, and why cannot we stop breathing when we try?",
"Another essential to the action of the joints is the pressure of the outside air.",
"There are various forms of perfect joints, according to the nature and amount of movement permitted.",
"These joints permit free motion in almost every direction.",
"In time it is tired, and begins to relax.",
"They relax the tension of body and mind, and introduce an element of pleasure into the routine of school life.",
"Shake again.",
"The reverse condition occurs in the act of turning pale.",
"The visible movements of breathing vary according to circumstances.",
"Disease has a marked effect upon the mode of breathing.",
"The movements of breathing go on without our attention.",
"This breathing center is affected by the condition of the blood.",
"The brain, on receiving the intelligence, at once sends back the required instructions.",
"The end differs from the beginning only in degree.",
"Study the general construction of the throat by the help of a hand mirror.",
"Repeat the same on the throat of some friend.",
"In fact, there is no other way to study properly the structure and use of the bones and joints than by the bones themselves.",
"Difficult breathing.",
"She, however, did not entirely abandon the hope of seeing him again.",
"The growth of those crops he has nothing to do with.",
"The dead arose.",
"When he caught sight of one of the latter walking ahead of him, he would call to him to show his face, as if he feared that he might kill him by mistake.",
"So she arose and left the room.",
"She never spoke to her sister again, because she had allowed herself to be beaten by so small a man.",
"I would have sent it through the universe like a flash of fire.",
"One wonders whether creatures who live, the country people believe, wherever men and women have lived in earlier times, followed us from the ruins of the old town?",
"Sends up the letter to the lady.",
"But for that night I had no occasion for her further attendance.",
"Which is the more extraordinary, as he was so pressing for marriage before we came to town.",
"And if my friends will but give me hope, I will resolve to abandon him for ever.",
"Then turning to him, I asked, if he kept me there his prisoner?",
"She had ordered a chair, on purpose to exclude my personal attendance.",
"Here I arose.",
"But the child was pale.",
"Her face was pale and little and round.",
"It was pale and wild.",
"He understands boys.",
"Yet the most that she feared was that her parents were mapping out a career for her.",
"The color came back into her pale face.",
"How goes this gear?",
"Call for the prisoner.",
"Bring forth the prisoner.",
"Would the visitor care to wait a few minutes?",
"She knew not what to fear, yet feared everything.",
"He knew he was watched, and so he has never made a movement to go to his prisoner.",
"She arose at once and left the room.",
"At any rate, she still found her as reserved as ever.",
"He promised to abandon his experiments.",
"He thought and thought and feared.",
"But accidents will happen.",
"His throat had been cut from ear to ear.",
"He feared a catch.",
"Then, in a flash of thought, it came to him.",
"And, as he spoke, he turned quite pale, and then quite white.",
"It was a police photograph.",
"I am not a bad scholar myself.",
"And the answer came to me in a flash, with the beating of my own heart.",
"Hence it will be well for me to begin by giving the conclusions that I reached by reasoning from the facts set forth in the newspapers before any of the further facts came to my knowledge.",
"He had but little respect for woman, and was divorced from his wife after living with her for a year.",
"There are but few traces of emotion, or passion, or intellectual force.",
"It is this which especially demands our notice, and hence will form the main subject of this lecture.",
"The average attendance of scholars at this school is not very large.",
"The attendance is not very numerous.",
"The seats are plain and strong with open backs.",
"Air heated in other apartments.",
"Their breathing.",
"How they arose.",
"Sweet milk not heated too much.",
"Nursing at both breasts.",
"Seats with backs.",
"Is it not the application of a cold liquid to a heated surface, still?",
"And I question whether I shall succeed in reasoning them out of it.",
"And yet it is to be feared that very few receive it as a practical truth, in the management of children.",
"Everything should be made secure and firm, to avoid, if possible, the danger of accidents.",
"And what was done when they were thus heated?",
"Nor should the backs of seats be so high as they usually are, either for children or adults.",
"I was heated with exercise and sat near the table.",
"But when law became complicated, a class of men arose to interpret it.",
"But to proceed with my account of our other papers.",
"The moment they are introduced, it is a hint to the visitor to take leave.",
"He cleared his throat.",
"That accomplished and charming woman found it difficult, at first, to follow the close chain of my reasoning.",
"A new lecture always has a certain excitement connected with its delivery.",
"A new lecture is just like any other new tool.",
"A lecture ought to be something which all can understand, about something which interests everybody.",
"Remembering her lost child, she taught the children of others.",
"From our position the rear of the army was but a short distance, while the advanced portions of it were engaged.",
"He values the substance of man more than his accidents.",
"He speaks for the ear which takes in at once and understands.",
"The scenes in the theatre are generally excellent.",
"This time the principal difficulties arose within the ship.",
"After the lecture had been completed members of the audience were invited to talk over the telephone.",
"No sooner was one problem solved than another presented itself.",
"The next morning he found his boots frozen.",
"But now a new question arose.",
"What if he fights?",
"He feared to make sure of the extent of his injury.",
"He feared to stay in the kitchen.",
"No boots!",
"And that this is the real state of the case we proceed to prove by the following historical facts.",
"They were as iron to fire, only the iron was never heated.",
"Now he had planted our flag under her very walls.",
"One is the theatre, the other is the club.",
"The sun grows pale.",
"Would she reject him?",
"Vast empty shell!",
"Show me the photograph again.",
"Unfortunately both incidents occurred, and the evil results of both were quickly felt.",
"The same theatre of war brought again similar actors on the scene.",
"But to proceed.",
"However, no more of what might have been, let us proceed to what was.",
"Sometimes now I cannot even persuade myself that it was a human being.",
"It turned and, entering, I mounted the stairs to the room that I had so recently left.",
"She was now pale, but entirely calm.",
"I should like to lecture about him.",
"The more I think about accidents, the less do I believe in them.",
"What was there to remember, or if there was anything worth remembering, why should they remember it?",
"If they do not work, they are taken care of anyway by the territory, given food, shelter, clothes, and medical attendance.",
"I am bringing up the rear and getting more than my share.",
"He complained about the sun, but that was necessary for the photograph, and he had to stand it.",
"And when a flood arose, the stream broke against that house and could not shake it, because it was well built.",
"The day came when he solved his escape.",
"The chance visitor, or he who looks now and then, never understands them.",
"I have no right to compare and to reject.",
"The figure lacked the left foot.",
"The mystery was solved!",
"I go every night to the theatre, except when there is no opera.",
"I feared to think this out by myself.",
"This has thrown me all out of gear in every way.",
"I have no photograph at hand, but I will send one when I can.",
"She was very ill when she sat for it, which may a little explain the appearance of the photograph.",
"She sees the qualities of things, their claims, and their places.",
"She said that he was a visitor.",
"To begin with, the hat and boots are all wrong.",
"His father says that he never plays, and understands everything just like a grown person."],

"Thus I was, and only the memory that I had lived through the dark, once before, served to sustain my thoughts.",
"It assured me that they must not be regarded, by any means, as mere animals.",
"Arriving at her room, I laid her upon the bed.",
"The day slipped away, and the night came, and went much as the last few nights had gone.",
"Gradually, I grew more collected, while the world slipped across the centuries into the future.",
"It appeared to be approaching.",
"It is approaching.",
"Quite a number of women followed the debates.",
"No invitation was more appreciated, as it was almost impossible to have places unless one was invited by a friend.",
"The first look was disappointing.",
"Life proceeds to life.",
"With what delight we would make it work, to see what it would do!",
"We should never be tired of such a toy, because every day it would reveal new possibilities of power and delight.",
"Some mothers do not allow their little girls to go to school until their beds are made up and their rooms in order.",
"After a slight pause, he replied, that he got his living on the water.",
"It was then used as a mere hunting ground, no one liking to settle in a place that seemed shut out from the rest of the world.",
"There was one man in the crowd, whose extraordinary good fortune I could not but admire.",
"This news operated on me like a charm.",
"The grounds were explored.",
"I knocked at the door and entered.",
"It was a rush job, and that mate was having his hands full.",
"The mate said something again.",
"Nobody paid any attention to the mate.",
"An embarrassed pause fell.",
"Events had slipped beyond my control.",
"Why, the old fool is crazy!",
"A pause followed.",
"Among the ordinary affairs of life he had relied on me for every detail.",
"I adjusted the caps carefully, and stepped out of the window, upon the narrow roof upon which it opens.",
"If they do not, they may understand and be assured of the fact now.",
"Now their curious troubles were over.",
"Every body cared about the taxes.",
"The majority of the paths are laid out in the following manner.",
"There was a big potato there.",
"Why will not people dress and write so that every body can admire and understand them.",
"But this liking she did not, as a rule, return in any decided fashion.",
"They suggest too many different trains of thought.",
"Then there was an extraordinary pause, in which neither of them seemed able to think of anything to say.",
"Another pause was beginning.",
"There was a pause.",
"There was an embarrassed pause.",
"I admire him for it.",
"How people would admire her!",
"He cared for her.",
"There was another pause.",
"She seemed to admire him.",
"He looked at her in delight almost too great for expression.",
"He is a fool.",
"He went up to her, as she lifted her head, and looked at her once more.",
"They would point out to her interesting sights as they passed along.",
"She tried to stop them, but they slipped away.",
"He knocked and knocked again.",
"It is very disappointing.",
"The soul of a man can hardly be recorded in black and white keys.",
"One day a vessel came in sight, and keeping in the middle of the river would have passed by without stopping.",
"Yet he had troubles closer at home than this even.",
"She did not pause.",
"There was a pause, then so long that she had a sense of falling through its space.",
"Of course the mate turned the handle the wrong way.",
"None of them, however, would go into the lock, not even the smallest of them.",
"She saw the object move slowly over the window and disappear in the darkness beneath it.",
"There was a short pause as though each waited for the other to begin.",
"The kind invitation was accepted, and we remained there over night.",
"The approaching man fired on him at once, but missed his aim.",
"We made our beds in a row, with our feet towards the fire.",
"Night was approaching, and I began to look around for a suitable camping ground for the command.",
"In fact I cared very little about it, and therefore made no effort whatever to secure an election.",
"At the end of a year, the vessel broke again.",
"It knocked the breath right out of him!",
"Still other words came stealing to his memory.",
"No one had ever cared to know about her father before.",
"After a pause she began to speak slowly and her voice was sweet and low.",
"She had learned to cover her wounds with a smile.",
"After a pause he spoke again.",
"All the many pockets were empty save the long one in the middle.",
"A long pause.",
"What was the fool doing?",
"They lifted him up and started for the big tent.",
"But at the bottom of my heart I admire him.",
"They should never be large or the home atmosphere must disappear.",
"But he has to adapt himself not only to the physical but to the human environment in which he lives.",
"Very often they went to watch the trains.",
"Every set of children must work things out for themselves, using their own environments and their own advantages.",
"In actual practice, however, we act too often as if we only cared for economic values.",
"Some long sights were therefore necessary.",
"This was welcome news for me, as I expected he would have reached that point long before I arrived, on account of the many delays I had met with on the coast range.",
"Both felt assured now that they would round out the year with fair credit to themselves.",
"Soon to my delight I found that here was a weapon with which I need fear few rivals.",
"As I lifted up my eyes I saw for the first time the mountains near at hand.",
"Suddenly he lifted himself.",
"The strange men looked ugly, and the boys and girls, after a pause, turned off in another direction.",
"With sudden determination she slipped out of bed and stood up.",
"She was in reality kind to everybody, liking to see pleasant faces about her.",
"There is nobody in this house but will be good to her, and admire her, and take an example by her.",
"That was a great delight.",
"There was a great deal to think about in what she had heard, but she did not even think about that, only resigned herself to the delight of sitting there in the sweet air and being happy.",
"It seemed to her that there never could be a time when she should want for wonder and interest and delight, so long as she had this to think of.",
"As for the sights in the streets, I began to grow used to them.",
"The doctor treated me as if I were a fool.",
"The darkness, however, was so complete that all marks, as of trees or paths, disappeared.",
"The door closed upon us, and there was again a pause.",
"I have been as a fool without understanding.",
"How may a master play fast and loose in his methods of instruction?",
"How should I derive pleasure from these things?",
"He seemed troubled and embarrassed.",
"Here, mate, hold on, though.",
"He slipped the thing back into his pocket.",
"What are the divisions or kinds of internal attention?",
"The managing editor, feeling embarrassed by the presence of the artist, opened the letters.",
"Their faces were full of wonder and delight.",
"The types may remain, but the details of their form, their relative proportions, their associates, are all altered.",
"And, as each division exhibits corresponding parts in corresponding places, we say that all the divisions are constructed upon the same plan.",
"Then there is a pause.",
"He feels sure that a day will come when the world will know and admire it.",
"He had nothing to fear in approaching the rear, and in a few moments he had examined the walls.",
"If she could only be as well assured as her strong words implied!",
"Indeed, that little pause was a great and awful moment.",
"A moment later a great weight had slipped from his heart.",
"A little pause.",
"He had been knocked down like a dog.",
"He had a theory that little men had little souls.",
"And she immediately slipped into the chair.",
"I was a fool.",
"Thus reminded, I took the photograph out of the pocket into which I had slipped it, and looked at it again.",
"He slipped it over his right hand.",
"He slipped the message into its envelope and handed it back to me.",
"I watched it disappear under the rough covering with something like regret, for already my eyes were being opened to its beauty.",
"Poor souls, they needed this one day of rest when they could all lie late.",
"And so she looked embarrassed.",
"The little fool!",
"Again there came a long pause.",
"The sights and sounds vary somewhat at different seasons of the year.",
"She often got seeds from her father.",
"They jumped out of their beds.",
"Before morning these slipped away too.",
"It slipped out of his hand.",
"At one time she was lifted clear out of the water.",
"Name all the grades down to that which is lowest.",
"He came and carried me home, as I was unable to go myself on account of my wounds.",
"Thus I kept the keys from every body until my master came home.",
"He asked me for his keys, and I immediately took them off my neck and reached them out to him.",
"Still she was not a fool, and he would give her something to think about.",
"He was moved, but he was not a fool.",
"The extra water the pump lifted would not help much now.",
"We hear much of the importance of proportions, but the main point generally is that the house be not too high.",
"But here, as everywhere, we find the outside depends on the inside, and that what we most admire in them will conflict with the new requirements.",
"Wait on, souls!",
"The official reports show only the number that died, but make no distinction as to causes of death, except to separate the deaths from wounds received in battle from those from other causes.",
"There was a long pause.",
"I lifted her in my arms.",
"There is no end of the pleasant sights.",
"We are still a little embarrassed in her presence.",
"There was not another vessel in sight.",
"These, too, were lifted in the boat.",
"An hour later they had drawn close to the vessel.",
"Already they had been seen, for the vessel altered its course slightly.",
"The smaller vessel was drawing ahead rapidly now.",
"I had suddenly remembered that these keys were not in my rooms.",
"They were my keys, and I have already related how I came to drop them on the floor.",
"He had used his eyes to purpose, and was quite assured that the bottle he wanted was not there.",
"He had lifted it, and probably read what she had written in it during his absence.",
"And it did so disappear.",
"I, too, cared very little whether I lived or died.",
"There were other keys lying on this table.",
"She lifted her patient eyes, and looked straight at her brother.",
"It was an invitation for me to leave town with him that very evening and be married at some place he mentioned.",
"I stopped and looked at the keys.",
"He had gone, yet there were his keys.",
"The keys were still there.",
"It was safe, and in my relief at finding it, I knocked off the head of the bottle and took a long drink.",
"It seemed a long time before the girl lifted her face from him.",
"Quickly he led his blind mate toward it.",
"His blind mate had drawn back.",
"I disappear, but shall come back for her.",
"Arriving at a certain road they separated.",
"Arriving, he saw his wife.",
"A fool, the middle finger.",
"What was necessary was to lay down proportions, not the actual amount of the sum.",
"Additional spots on the disk of the sun are reported.",
"As he spoke he slipped out of bed, and held out his arms to take the baby.",
"He had soon made a nice little channel for it, so that it should not get into any of the beds.",
"The others around the table laughed in concert, and I could not but admit there was a grain of truth in the comparison.",
"A great deal more he told me, which slipped from my memory, for I was thinking over what he had already said.",
"All these divisions had to be trained hard.",
"Then came a pause.",
"No one was hurt, though several beds were struck.",
"The soldiers disappear.",
"A pause.",
"There has been one serious strike among the engineers since I began to write, and a good many minor troubles.",
"When he had got out, he slipped down to the ground, where the dogs were lying.",
"I have never heard of any such a vessel.",
"I knew too much for his liking.",
"If my journey there was in order to meet my love, I would not have cared.",
"Once started, however, she did not pause.",
"Already victory seemed to be assured.",
"All were much amazed at seeing what they had never before seen.",
"Suddenly he asked the name of the town we were rapidly approaching.",
"I went to the station, but found that no more trains were running.",
"I am approaching the king row now.",
"I might have suspected it before, but was it possible that I cared?",
"Was it possible that I cared?",
"He lifted his hat.",
"Leaving the table, he went and lifted down each picture carefully.",
"This is a delight, indeed!",
"He thought it was a judgment upon him for stealing, they were so hot.",
"So that he had change, what cared he?",
"The smallest girls took her up in the class.",
"Divisions of the mark.",
"The bad soldier has no peace, just because he troubles himself about things outside himself, and not in his own power.",
"But they forget that, and refuse his invitation.",
"Here pause.",
"History is little to us in such a place, which is to be enjoyed for its own sake, for its own unique beauty and delight.",
"The use to which it is put is not that for which it was intended, and half the delight of the place is thus lost to us.",
"Throwing themselves into the waves they surrounded our vessel.",
"Another long pause.",
"I had prepared it under her instruction and understood that it was properly signed.",
"I would say a fool is man who think he is wise.",
"Again there was a pause.",
"In one house, where the furniture had been sold, the poor souls had brought a great stone into the place, and this was their only seat.",
"Then she lifted him right up off the floor and into the mirror.",
"Some came by way of invitation, but mostly they arrived by accident.",
"It was not more than a second before he heard himself accepting the invitation.",
"But it brought its own share of troubles with it.",
"Be assured of this.",
"But hidden in this tough mass was one law of greater import than others.",
"These events caused delays which we must suppose were needed for preparing more perfectly the instrument to be used in the great work.",
"Not that she did not sometimes derive pleasure from the sights she was taken to.",
"One excellent plan of religious instruction she adopted in her own household.",
"Poor souls!",
"He no longer took delight in arms.",
"It was my part of the general instruction to give her lessons on this head.",
"I looked round on the books with the greatest delight.",
"In want of his next meal of seeds?",
"Even while she spoke the expression of her face changed to one of gay delight.",
"There was a little pause, and the color slowly left his face.",
"There was a little pause.",
"He knocked at the door on the left hand at the top of the stairs.",
"Perhaps he expected her to express delight, to come to him, possibly, and kiss him, as some women would have done.",
"The bear was approaching him.",
"It is so easily slipped through the fingers.",
"A pause, while they watch.",
"There was a pause, each boy filling it with thoughts he would not speak.",
"And he went home with all sorts of questions running through his mind, but with no very satisfying answers to make them.",
"But he would have accepted the invitation in any case.",
"It gave the people little instruction, and no responsibility or freedom.",
"If the college were not its own strongest argument, no words could strengthen it.",
"The man went through the movement of searching his pockets.",
"But was she going to give up because he was embarrassed?",
"I hate stealing, like any other piece of work or danger.",
"If the entertainment is to be simply an evening party, this must be specified on the card or note of invitation.",
"If by chance this should occur, have it replaced before the vessel is again brought into use.",
"It is also the smallest variety.",
"Prepared thus, every grain should be separate and white.",
"Its form is that of a small round grain.",
"The above proportions will make rather a large dish.",
"They should be watched, and, when done, carefully lifted out on to a glass dish without breaking them.",
"In choosing eggs, apply the tongue to the large end of the egg, and, if it feels warm, it is new, and may be relied on as a fresh egg.",
"The coffee should be made very strong, and served in very small cups, but never mixed with milk or cream.",
"The right arm is the one mostly operated on.",
"Let me strengthen the image a little.",
"I was really amazed at the change in his appearance.",
"What work of art has she ever added to its galleries?",
"Indeed I am not aware that he had, or cared to have, any legal business whatever.",
"What a delight their care was to me.",
"His whole appearance was so attractive and engaging that the children immediately took a liking to him.",
"I want to go away from here and disappear for a long time.",
"The latter, approaching his uncle with clear signs that he wanted him for something, had pulled him aside.",
"It had long ago slipped out of position.",
"It is announced by journals devoted to fashion, that trains are to be worn even longer during the coming winter than they have yet been.",
"Finally one slipped up behind me.",
"Another pause and silence, except for the noise in the distance.",
"Not a single enemy vessel remained in sight.",
"On their return this vessel was missing.",
"An embarrassing, but short pause succeeded, when the latter spoke.",
"I felt that the time of action was approaching, but I knew now that the first signal and movement would come from the woman, and so watched her.",
"I slipped down the bank and took to the water.",
"There was nothing very particular in this, but the time was approaching when things would be altered.",
"He resolved to meet the approaching storm.",
"This book was not planned, but grew out of the troubles of the time.",
"It records our differences and debates our policy.",
"He takes even the news with a very large grain of salt.",
"The driver assured me of that several times.",
"They were making a fool of him, some way!",
"He accepted one of the smallest and least valuable, rather declining to understand than refusing the offer of the rest.",
"Some minutes passed before either of us cared to speak.",
"The general form, however, seemed to be that of a square entered by a very short, narrow passage, and divided by broad paths, forming a cross of equal arms.",
"In them the differences of rank disappear, except that one sometimes sees a couple of chairs provided for officers.",
"They were being hard put to it to run trains at all.",
"He had been so much of a fool.",
"She saw it turn off the long, straight road ahead and disappear to the right.",
"She remembered, however, that the section of promising grain lay on the north slope, and therefore out of sight from where she was.",
"Quickly he slipped them under and around the gun, and then took a seat at the nearest table.",
"His father was refusing demands of some kind.",
"Stealing along these, he soon saw the light again, quite close.",
"While he ran he stuffed the money into his inside coat pockets.",
"Or was it that she still cared too much for herself?",
"But in his surprise he lifted his head from his hands to look at her.",
"I slipped up and heard the plot.",
"She need not lie nor play false nor fool herself here.",
"She seemed amazed.",
"The weather has knocked me out.",
"But they have their troubles.",
"Many soldiers with worse wounds had totally recovered.",
"Night with its trains of stars!",
"No one, in watching her while she was writing a letter, ever saw her pause to think what she should say next or how she should express the thought.",
"I feel as if a great burden was lifted from my soul.",
"I felt assured of this.",
"I have taken no sights, except as we came north, on this trip.",
"Only a careful search of the vessel could determine this.",
"This vessel has its back broken, and may slide off into deep water at any minute.",
"This sort of talk amazed both the others.",
"So they, too, sought their beds, such as these were, and tried to forget all else in sweet sleep.",
"He helped her in and lifted his foot to follow.",
"A moment later she slipped out.",
"He did not look back at her, but he did pause.",
"Then he went to her and put his hands under her arms and lifted her to her feet.",
"He had lifted his hand against a woman.",
"She lifted her head and looked at him.",
"Along the paths they had already made it was a much easier matter to make the return trip.",
"Suddenly he lifted his hands, putting them out toward her.",
"She lifted her head and sat up.",
"It must be long since they have made beds for themselves, but before lying down they turn themselves round and round as dogs do.",
"Who shall say what another will find most to his liking in the streets of the mountains.",
"Whether the wild things understand it or not they adapt themselves to its processes with the greater ease.",
"The animal seemed wild with delight.",
"He had thought it all out and outlined his course of action.",
"Love was the power that could transform the world.",
"Some of the women who came to the train were disappointing in appearance.",
"She turned quickly, and gave a cry of surprise and delight.",
"Every one had been lifted.",
"The weight of responsibility seemed to be lifted.",
"I was crazy with delight when I saw the guns brought out, and would jump up and bite at them.",
"He was much interested, and the book slipped to the floor.",
"She was very particular about their drinking water, and washed out the little glass cups that held it most carefully.",
"I never cared for him.",
"She lifted her eyes.",
"She lifted up once more her eye of faith.",
"He lifted his glass, and the rest did the same.",
"Then there was a long pause.",
"And what do I mean by good grain?",
"I must pause on that word.",
"That is, the beds are not exactly parallel.",
"The plants and animals grow, on the whole, more and more like our living forms as we rise in the series of beds.",
"What lifted it up?",
"The beds do not, as they would in that case, slope up to it.",
"There are, of course, all grades and varieties.",
"But those considered are by far the most important and the most recently explored.",
"Within limits, if the previous history of an individual is known, his physical appearance may be approximately described, and his future outlined.",
"Will cared little about shooting, and expected to do all his hunting with his camera.",
"Accused them of stealing, too!",
"Probably, in the early ages, only the great had cups to drink from.",
"Nobody can help liking her.",
"It is an opposition based on the idea that the common man is a fool who does not know what is good for him.",
"A fool may make money, but it needs a wise man to spend it.",
"The father and mother were equally amazed.",
"Amazed at the sight of so extraordinary a being, he asked him who and what he was.",
"Stealing silver, picking pockets!",
"Then he just lifted the money and dropped it again.",
"The cups broke on the floor and the other articles rolled under the seats.",
"He had traveled on school trains before.",
"She lifted the bottle.",
"She now for the first time lifted up her eyes.",
"But suddenly he slipped.",
"She had an invitation from the head of the family, and that was something which did not happen every day.",
"Yet he was not such a fool, he reflected, as to tell everything.",
"He would neither pause nor answer.",
"But she will delight in the plate.",
"After another long look she slipped the picture back into the envelope and laid it on the table behind her.",
"She colored, because when she was embarrassed she colored at everything, and could not think of another word to say.",
"Had he cared so very much?",
"If he might only know that she cared for the ring!",
"For once, all the fun was knocked out of him.",
"Their souls will be saved at last, they suppose, and that is all that they need care for.",
"He lifted his head, but not his eyes.",
"It amazed him.",
"This personal survey embarrassed the big man.",
"He cared less about the world as it was than for the world as it might be, and as long as life gave him something to dream about, he did not care in the least about the facts of existence.",
"Then he seen the grain heads and ate them while he was making up his mind what to do about me.",
"He may not be altogether a fool.",
"But he was not of those who sleep well on trains.",
"He went straight up to the front door and knocked.",
"And she refused the invitation.",
"I speak of his whole being, of the intelligence and heart that will come to him, and which he ought to derive from me alone.",
"And then, too, came the delight of the first smile.",
"But all he wants is to see the little one disappear.",
"Then, a continuous rise having set in, she laughed with delight.",
"Was slow destruction now arriving with blow following blow?",
"The governing classes alone were reasonable in keeping to small families.",
"They are of the size of a grain of sand.",
"The result was disappointing.",
"But to different minds they appeal in different proportions.",
"A national holiday is perhaps approaching.",
"Enjoys she not her health?",
"May good or bad reports delight the dead?",
"And what event shall all these troubles bring?",
"Why, what delays are these?",
"Because they throw away their souls at every mark.",
"Their souls!",
"Come, fool, never fear.",
"She was one of those whom no one can help liking, after seeing her smile once, or hearing her speak.",
"That is, they could at least have decided to stop the vessel till they were rid of their doubt.",
"I might cite others.",
"After a pause he went on.",
"A moment later he had lifted her to the ground.",
"He lifted her into the window, and she stood listening for a moment while she took from her finger the wedding ring she had worn for half an hour and gave it back to him.",
"This is that which I admire in him.",
"Care, that troubles all the world, was forgotten in his composition.",
"He never greatly cared for the society of what are called good people.",
"I was amazed at how much it cost me to fill my stomach outside home!",
"But what I saw remaining in the display tank amazed me.",
"Like any other teenager, I like fast and loud music.",
"The adults should be fed well before allowing them to mate.",
"What can be charged upon this delight of human kind?",
"Some instruction, therefore, is necessary, and much, perhaps, may be dangerous.",
"They are too remote to share the general government, and, therefore, claim the privilege of governing themselves.",
"The other vessel, which they lost in the late storm, could not be discovered.",
"What advantage can arise from delays?",
"Had I known that this was the last time that I should enjoy in this world, the conversation of a friend whom I so much respected, and from whom I derived so much instruction and entertainment, I should have been deeply affected.",
"When I knocked at the door that evening, no one came to admit me.",
"And then I have my own troubles.",
"But she tried, and with great wonder and delight discovered that she could work as she had never done before.",
"But she only made one shirt for me, and then got tired, so I keep it like an old fool, as I am.",
"I myself may change the shape and size of my box by establishing new relations between the bits of wood, but for the pieces of wood themselves the proportions determined by my mind must remain fixed quantities, otherwise no construction could take place.",
"Volumes might be written of the varied careers and wild lives lived by these strange soldiers of fortune.",
"It is his nature and the teaching of his schools and professors.",
"And that is not easy to acquire from an army that is hard to please in the matter of professors of religion.",
"There was along and silent pause after his reply.",
"An anxious pause succeeded this reply.",
"A long pause succeeded.",
"Now, I admire a woman who has confidence in herself.",
"Another pause.",
"What ought we all to do, but try to save our souls?",
"Every religion should be interpreted by the professors of that religion.",
"I assured her she need not trouble herself about it, for I could attend to it.",
"They immediately accepted the invitation.",
"The boys are so far from stealing them, that if they find any on the ground, they take them to him.",
"I felt satisfied in having done what I could to direct them in the right way, and to strengthen them in it.",
"It was a lovely sight to see so many of this class under a course of religious and useful instruction.",
"He handed his glass to the mate, who carefully examined every fragment which appeared above water.",
"The mate ran and got his glass.",
"She told them the name of the street, and assured them if they would remember that and the number, any one would point it out to them.",
"Others no doubt subsequently died of their wounds.",
"Then he stood and watched the red lights disappear.",
"The room assigned to him, which could only have been occupied for a few minutes, has been locked up and the keys handed to the police.",
"He was a fool to think he could live alone like this, with such a burden to bear!",
"The typing was perfect.",
"It was just the one thing in life I cared anything about.",
"They were approaching the theatre.",
"This, indeed, might be the end of all his troubles.",
"The smallest child knew that a fight to a finish had begun.",
"I slipped behind a tree and waited.",
"He opened the till and slipped some money into his pocket.",
"However, he assured us that he was perfectly well, but unable to sleep properly.",
"I slipped out of the house.",
"So speaking, he picked up the photograph and half slipped it into the case.",
"It was reasonable to suppose that a man who is well dressed would possess a watch and chain, and have money in his pockets, and possibly rings on his fingers.",
"Their faces wore the expression of men thinking on the same lines and arriving at the same conclusion.",
"Again and again she lifted the hat free from the sand and sought to place it so it would bear a part at least of her weight.",
"He had knocked her cold!",
"They had elected him to do it and he was getting along all right till she thought of having this blamed fool dance.",
"He would fool them.",
"There was a general pause for the answer.",
"Her heart gave a leap of delight.",
"He cared, but he was gone!",
"All out of breath, I told my mother almost the exact words of the answers to my invitation.",
"Again my shadow slipped away, and moved as often as I did.",
"Many narrow beds were in one straight line down the entire length of the wall.",
"Thus his ears were open and ready to catch the smallest wish she might express.",
"He is a fool!",
"As boys, they had little in common upon which to rest the basis of a friendship, or even a mutual liking.",
"A mountain seemed to have been lifted from his heart.",
"But the lessons were only a part of the daily instruction I received.",
"It is true the failures were often in things in which success, in so early a stage of my progress, was almost impossible.",
"There was a pause for a moment.",
"He slipped, by their weight, from her arms and fell into the chair.",
"Stop the vessel!",
"But I doubt if she was a child who cared more for such things than for her parents and her home.",
"I was a fool that I did not try to do it before.",
"The proposal greatly embarrassed him.",
"We knocked at this door.",
"Let us install ourselves in this hall.",
"The beds touched each other.",
"A moving mass was seen, and an approaching light.",
"Appearances were on our side, actual facts not so.",
"It is frequently connected with approaching disorder of the brain.",
"Again she was lifted high in the air.",
"An animal was approaching the tent.",
"The name of the vessel was not in keeping with her general appearance.",
"The vessel brought only one passenger.",
"But those who understand the law of the subject will have no one but themselves to blame if they do not derive all possible benefits from it.",
"I cared not at all for that.",
"She was shocked when she saw the forms of women, which, if at least well covered, were none the less outlined.",
"What a fool he had been!",
"It may be relied upon.",
"Night came also at length, and with it came an experience, new even to this man who had been knocked about somewhat, and who thought he knew his world.",
"It would sustain as many boys and girls as could be packed upon it.",
"Each male, in addition to caring for his mate, did good in the world for men and women.",
"How the invitation came I could not tell, but we made no inquiry and accepted it.",
"It was a delight anywhere, but it seemed now out of place.",
"When a man becomes great, the smallest details of his career increase in value and importance.",
"But here I pause.",
"Assume that with her invitation the man committed himself.",
"Not for a moment was it lifted.",
"To do good to others is to make life interesting and find peace for our own souls.",
"He made out a female figure approaching it.",
"She went away and returned with a bunch of keys.",
"The other foot he lifted in the air.",
"He lifted his hand.",
"I never cared for that kind.",
"A child of the least musical talent would surely have responded in some measure to such excellent instruction.",
"Both of us accepted the invitation.",
"It is only the place of instruction that has shifted.",
"Indeed, they buy books in larger proportions, for the reason that there are so many more books to be bought!",
"There I agreed to return again so soon as I could find a vessel fit for the enterprise.",
"Even he did not venture to say that merely to assist slaves to escape was stealing.",
"They all started off, I suppose, ran straight down to the vessel and got into the hold!",
"But, to constitute the stealing of slaves, according to the law as laid down by the court, there must be something more yet.",
"Could people thus completely disappear nowadays?",
"Rest assured of that.",
"About to move away, he suddenly lifted his head and listened.",
"He looked embarrassed but said nothing.",
"Once, when she lifted her eyes, they met his.",
"They would disappear from the sight of men for months.",
"Nobody cared to argue the matter with him.",
"It seemed to him that hours slipped away.",
"He was embarrassed.",
"But the girl would have been amazed if she could have read his thoughts.",
"He was embarrassed at being alone with the girl inside the walls of a house.",
"He wanted her for his mate.",
"All day she worked at this, and by night had a rough sort of wooden ski that might serve at need.",
"By the end of the year it was becoming apparent that success was assured.",
"In the chapters which follow the further steps which were taken to deal with the problem, and the degree of success which attended them, will be described.",
"This was done so far as possible, our principal difficulty being to provide officers capable of giving the instruction required.",
"They were very completely realized by me, who saw them appear day by day and disappear under treatment.",
"Later, he could easily disappear and leave no trace.",
"When I was sure, I knocked, but no answer came.",
"I knocked again.",
"I had very little hope that, even on the chance of my arriving while he was away, he would have left the door open.",
"I hardly cared what she did, now.",
"A man might vote right and act like a fool the rest of the year.",
"Those that do not, get holes knocked in them sooner or later.",
"I wish he would find his own means of expressing himself, instead of always stealing my ideas.",
"I knocked his head off while he was sleeping.",
"We never pause to ask the poet whether such an animal exists.",
"Building a vessel!",
"He had large, fat hands and cold, dark calculating eyes.",
"But it nowhere defines that term.",
"What a fool he had been not to understand.",
"She did not admire the photograph, but she wanted to look at it.",
"She lifted her eyes, met his own, held them.",
"And then each cared enough to assume the pretty role required by the other, and by the occasion, and by the air of the time.",
"What then is in the power of art or instruction to perform?",
"They were a happy race, poor souls!",
"Here the business continued to grow until it reached proportions of which we had little idea when we began it.",
"Any fool could buy this business, but only an expert could run it successfully.",
"They should have the privilege of choosing, but they must tell us the one they had chosen, that we might send the invitation for them.",
"Then I wanted a guide, and I was well assured he knew the way, if any man did.",
"No pause was made even here.",
"He had issued from the forest only a few minutes before, and understanding the intention of the ceremony, he approached the spot as fast as weakness and wounds would allow.",
"How to distinguish the work of each, in founding the common tongue, is not here our province.",
"I have knocked.",
"She assured them that she could not sleep, not for the whole night, if she had not found the song.",
"There was a slight pause.",
"Often she felt like refusing the responsibility altogether.",
"Then an awful pause.",
"Once let us reach the station and our troubles are over.",
"He seemed to care nothing at all for appearances, and, as everybody knows, this comfortable attitude of mind is the privilege of the famous few.",
"She had no intention of making an old fool of herself or of letting him be one either.",
"They knew nothing of the property and cared less for its real value.",
"And when the long hour struck she arose with resolution and knocked at the door.",
"He lifted a hand, found the switch, and turned the light on.",
"There they disappear.",
"I had most carefully seen to my sights long before, for I knew how much would probably depend on my first shot.",
"The numerous fishing beds give a false idea of the number of bear present in a district, as it takes but a few days for a single bear to cover the sides of a stream for a long distance with such places.",
"Then if one kills the female the male gives trouble, often charging on sight.",
"Often such beds are behind a rock, not a high one, but one that the sheep could look over.",
"Approaching closer, we shot him in a vital spot.",
"Why should they throw away their lives for a flag for which they cared nothing?",
"The winter session was approaching.",
"The student slipped aside and avoided him.",
"It was to this middle one that the mate led me.",
"He slipped his mouth free again.",
"With her on our side, we forgot our fears, and, with an assured air, asked her husband to show us to our rooms.",
"No doubt it was the shadow of the great town we were approaching.",
"After a little she lifted her head.",
"But never, until now, had that want reached so great proportions.",
"The road was somewhat disappointing to him, too.",
"Be assured.",
"One sometimes loses a single word.",
"We had not time to accept of his invitation.",
"This, he assured us, was a true story.",
"He insisted that I should not go to the castle this day before dinner, as it would look like seeking an invitation.",
"There was a pause, and though he looked away from her, he knew that she was crying.",
"There was a pause in the music outside, and a voice was heard speaking.",
"She sat up, and lifted her pretty hands to smooth the soft waves of her brown hair.",
"I was such a fool!",
"But I have observed she is a fool who always knows her own mind.",
"A pause now occurs, and the same breathing movements are repeated.",
"The number is smallest during sleep.",
"A vessel by which blood is carried away from the heart.",
"The mother looked on in silent delight.",
"All fear of winning her aid was lifted.",
"She lifted her head from his breast, and moved slightly away from him.",
"It is a wonderful aid to the memory, which carries away the image, and never loses it.",
"They knocked at each familiar door.",
"She took it with the proper feeling, but did not experience the same delight as on the previous day.",
"She passed so close that the skirt of her dress touched him.",
"And the boy ran, and he threw the vessel after him, and it broke with a great noise, and whatever came out of it, his head was gone there and then.",
"Returned to the vessel.",
"Fish, rats, grass seeds, and a few roots, constitute their chief food.",
"Enjoys the confusion of a fine woman.",
"She assured me, that I should not be broken in upon.",
"The man is no fool.",
"He lifted his face straight up and dropped his arms straight down at his side and walked right along, no matter how fast the tears came.",
"But as he watched she slowly lifted her bright head, and looked quietly about the room.",
"They sat up in their beds and talked about it.",
"It thinks all the time about the forest, and its mate who is out there somewhere.",
"And they, who cared for nobody, cared for her.",
"It was true, she had slipped away when no one noticed.",
"She had not hoped for this final delight.",
"No one cared.",
"But she was too quick for him, and slipped away, farther out to sea.",
"But the people in the garden never lifted their eyes to see it.",
"Then there was a long pause, when both mother and son seemed to be thinking sad, sad thoughts.",
"Houses were fewer now, and the trees not so large, nor well cared for.",
"And this not only as regarded her own troubles, but those of her friends as well.",
"As if we cared!",
"I was all knocked out, and hardly knew what I was doing.",
"If we do not help them our souls will be lost.",
"The learned grain thought for several minutes.",
"But it all happened just as the learned grain had said, which showed what a wise grain it was, and how much it had found out just by thinking hard and remembering all it could.",
"It was so proud that it felt grand, however much it was knocked about.",
"Peace, fool!",
"What, is the old fool gone?",
"Away, old fool!",
"She accepted the invitation.",
"Right easily may this be assured.",
"He cared not though he came, for peace was not in his heart.",
"It was then that someone knocked upon their chamber door.",
"Appearances were all against him.",
"He lifted it to the end of the cigarette.",
"The fool asked no more questions.",
"And if he did not care, why nobody else cared either.",
"He slipped away off the rocks into the water, as I said before.",
"And therefore her photographs were very curious and famous, and the children looked with great delight for the opening of the book.",
"One must never judge by appearances.",
"Why should he disappear?",
"The appearances, therefore, did not quite agree with the apparent purpose.",
"They denied to men even the capability of arriving at truth.",
"It was not the body he cared for so much as the soul.",
"The royal household was regulated by different grades of officers.",
"In the first place their country was rent by political divisions, disorders, and civil wars.",
"They permit one another to enter and remain in their meeting house with the hat on or off, and with the hands either in the pockets or out of them.",
"This is accounted for through its having no galleries.",
"Anybody may see the sights we have just described.",
"How caps produce disease.",
"Air beds.",
"Soft beds.",
"Beds recently occupied by the sick.",
"No caps.",
"Injury done by caps.",
"The covering of beds.",
"Many a person loses his health, and not a few their lives, in this way.",
"He named several sorts of grain, but still the door would not open.",
"Here was a long pause.",
"He received his instruction from his father.",
"A man was regarded as a fool who gave anything except to the rich.",
"What have I to do with shares or divisions?",
"The evening was approaching, and I did not know how far I had come, or where I was.",
"We were most lucky, they say, to get off when we did from the troubles.",
"The paths in this part, however, were stopped up in so many directions, that it was impossible to get an entrance through them to such parts as might determine the question.",
"Wise men, they say, may always learn something, even from a fool.",
"She manages to turn her humor to account in various ways.",
"Instruction on religious subjects is also given throughout the course.",
"Without it the cable could not have been operated even for a short period.",
"In the face of repeated failures, and doubt as to whether messages could be sent rapidly enough to make any cable a commercial success, it was extremely difficult to raise fresh capital.",
"The stations owned and operated by boys have already proved of great use.",
"So I have always thought it was a good thing to have troubles, as long as they are not too serious or too numerous.",
"It is a satisfaction, however, to be assured that their record is on high.",
"This fact will explain the invitation now given.",
"Before the end of the week the place was filled, and souls were being converted.",
"Their poor souls need a holiday.",
"But of one thing I felt assured.",
"To several of them reference has been made in former chapters.",
"The plan provided for monthly payments, and was operated through the use of cards.",
"To the first named, reference has been made in former chapters.",
"Many farmers were amazed to hear we had come over the hills instead of going around, and wondered how the machine managed to do it.",
"They pay their full share of public taxes and assessments and give largely in charity.",
"What delight!",
"Nor let my words import more blame than needs.",
"But what delays?",
"No pause or stay.",
"She had called him a fool so often!",
"I have seen it with delight.",
"They both slipped out of the room.",
"Her constant appeal to the law had been the principal cause of her present troubles.",
"It seemed to clear off half the troubles of the day, and at its conclusion a smile was visible on every face.",
"It is not easy at first to see how the green manages to find its way inside the church, but the grass seems to get in everywhere.",
"Who cared?",
"The seeds of love.",
"He lifted both hands to his face.",
"She knew they did admire her, and that was enough.",
"All appearances tend to make us doubt it.",
"Each man to his liking.",
"But this is quite apart from the delight of the achievement itself.",
"All that these men earn is that much in their own pockets.",
"He was waiting for the invitation.",
"Well, I got there, but listen first to my troubles.",
"I am no fool.",
"Perhaps the failures only will be brought up, wild.",
"He had a particular delight in boys, and an excellent way with them.",
"Why cannot I rest and take delight in what is before me?",
"It is to this we come at last in our criticism, and if it does not help us to live it may as well disappear, no matter what its fine qualities may be.",
"He was walking by her side, with his hands in his coat pockets.",
"If I could not, I should let them go, assured that we could do without them.",
"The import of a word is not fixed.",
"Every now and then I rise a little and look through it, to see whether we are arriving.",
"They then went to the house, through the rain, and knocked at all the doors without getting any response.",
"It has become for them a divided skirt.",
"I shall write by this or next post to the only friends I have who, I think, would have an influence, as they are both professors.",
"I read it with great delight.",
"Like a fool.",
"An earth thing, potato.",
"And they must be feelings of delight, if they are to be vital.",
"I was more embarrassed than any of them.",
"People made them appearance on the stairs and galleries, and followed me.",
"Nothing that actually occurs is of the smallest importance.",
"Sake, or rice beer, is always passed round before the visitors leave, in little cups with the gods of luck at the bottom of them.",
"To judge from appearances, the children form the chief topic at this morning gathering."],

"He was interested in everything that concerned the patients, and always had a kind word for the nurses.",
"A taxi was waiting at the door.",
"She ought to have trusted him.",
"Here are the hats.",
"All the people had thought a lot of the mother, even though she was a slave.",
"The wives talked it over.",
"She taught one of his wives how to help her.",
"Then the chief and his wives and the chief men came back to the village.",
"They stuck sticks in the ground for the wall.",
"He sang at his work.",
"Then she sang a song in the native language.",
"I pray all the time.",
"That is why it became a slave market.",
"Here she spent many weeks resting and gaining her strength.",
"She became weaker and weaker.",
"But his effort burst his heart.",
"So intense was the pain he suffered that he asked to be left alone that he might scream, as that seemed to bring some relief.",
"No man ever gained higher respect from all parties, and no man was ever more fully trusted by the people at large.",
"He dropped something in against the coins.",
"It cut as she bent into it.",
"Till I could scream at the sight of it.",
"As a matter of fact, the expected storm never burst.",
"Brush was reported to have purchased it.",
"Brush continued at the head of the business until his death.",
"Brush was a member also were represented.",
"The situation was discussed and there seemed no doubt in the mind of any one of the party that the only thing to be done was to inform the police at once.",
"So he sat up and struck a match to light his old pipe.",
"From time to time I heard them gradually gaining on me.",
"I never believed that he was half as scared as he seemed to be, but that he was merely pretending so that we could enjoy our joke.",
"The place whose very stones were dear to him, where he had learned all he knew of home.",
"His promotion had been rapid.",
"It was blowing straight out of the north and into their faces.",
"It occurred to him that he would pray.",
"They had also brought, or permitted to follow, not only their wives and daughters, but their children, big and little.",
"Pray, why so?",
"What need of any, pray?",
"Pray stay a little longer.",
"How was it, pray?",
"His sister burst into tears.",
"I slave my life out, and what thanks do I get for it?",
"When she woke up, she did not know where under the sun she was.",
"It has always seemed to aim at extending and ordering the mind content of children.",
"The idea of throwing stones starts the examination of different kinds, which have to be provided for the purpose.",
"We were pretending to warm ourselves by the fire, and I said my frozen meat was so cold that it hurt my teeth.",
"All these phases stand for both progress and arrest.",
"The fields of gold will not be exhausted in the near future.",
"The sun rises and sets away in the south but there is no pitch darkness.",
"Pen stepped over to him.",
"I lied.",
"And it warns me, too, that my turn will probably come next.",
"They say all this means that they are our equals, and intend to show it.",
"Clearly the sound was human, though from what kind of crazy human creature I could not guess.",
"They sat on the floor and sang a loose song.",
"After that we all sang, all but me, who have no voice.",
"The great house had been let, and the family who had taken it had been about a week in possession.",
"The moon had gone behind a cloud.",
"The child has seen a picture, and it has taken possession of her imagination.",
"How soon she woke no one can tell.",
"He woke up in a moment, and understood, and everything was clear to him.",
"Upon her there was no cloud nor doubt.",
"He gave a glance round him to see that there were no officials in sight, then left the file in which he was walking, and joined me.",
"Out there all by itself in the ruin, and nobody to help it!",
"It was on my heart that my boy would die if I could not find some way of helping this creature.",
"I knew the creature, and it was in trouble.",
"I had examined the ruined rooms closely the first day.",
"He woke as we stood all round his bed.",
"The country lies a ruined waste.",
"It is added that there is another larger work giving an account of his travels in various countries.",
"And he will find them a lasting assistance through life.",
"And he trusted me absolutely.",
"We pray in the name of the church.",
"I will pray with the spirit.",
"I will pray also with the understanding.",
"Have we chosen suitable time and place to pray?",
"They had trusted to his ancient friendship.",
"He will ruin everything.",
"They have been caught in a trap.",
"But, pray tell me!",
"I know whom to address, but I must be where I can use trusted agents.",
"With few exceptions, the great secrets of the convention died with them.",
"And then he stood quietly for a time, listening to the voices of the wind in the ruin.",
"As far as he was concerned, her first glance must do to read and judge and remember him by.",
"One glance around was sufficient to teach him the meaning of the silence.",
"I decided to brush him aside.",
"He had seen that the big man had followed his own example and had measured him at a glance.",
"Truly this man was all a creature of spirit and nerve.",
"And he laughed as he caught my glance.",
"It needed but a glance to tell me that the man was dead.",
"Then, as he raised it into the light, a sharp cry burst from him.",
"I liked the man, and I felt he could be trusted.",
"It was that creature.",
"In fact, when I sat down of an evening and lit my pipe and began to think it over, I found that I understood nothing at all.",
"One glance at it was enough.",
"The old man bent forward and shot down a long arm to recover his own.",
"For a while she walked with bent head.",
"Why should I intend ill toward her?",
"And they gave him a peace pipe to carry with him.",
"After he had found this out, many people got white hats to wear in the summer time.",
"That was because one of her feet had been caught in a trap.",
"At school he used to draw with a pen before he could write.",
"But he had no brush to paint with.",
"He thought he had him in a trap.",
"At one place the men refused to go through the freezing water.",
"The brush was broken down there.",
"They beat down the brush and make great roads.",
"He held his pipe under it.",
"Soon the pipe began to smoke.",
"When these burst, they made a light.",
"He used to pray that he might be a poet.",
"They would freeze till they were as hard as stones in winter.",
"Let us glance first at the human variations.",
"Obviously, they are not to be brought without considerable effort into a position of tried and trusted friendship.",
"What power does this suggest that he has besides the possession of a great deal of money?",
"He imagined what these ideas would be like if they had surfaces.",
"This book is not one to glance through.",
"Before I dismiss this country, I must just inform my reader what I remember concerning this place.",
"I would inform them that I bought nothing which I did not absolutely want.",
"She looked up with a start and the blood came to her skin, but she gave him a quick, searching glance.",
"The girl was afraid of somebody, and, seeing no other help, she trusted him.",
"A black cloud had rolled up and there were lines on the water.",
"He had done what he had undertaken, and after waiting for a few moments he started back.",
"Putting down his pipe, he got into bed.",
"She gave him the bag, and although her glance was steady he knew she was embarrassed.",
"She gave him a quick glance and colored.",
"She put down her cup and her glance was soft.",
"We have drawn on the reserves and I expect this implies we are losing money.",
"He looked as if he were exhausted by the work she had sent him to do.",
"The power and efficiency of an army consist in the amount of the power and efficiency of its elements, in the health, strength, and energy of its members.",
"Precisely determining the extent of the purpose they design to effect, and the amount of force that is and will be needed, they make their arrangements to provide or generate and maintain so much as long as they intend to do the work.",
"Yet she then sang at sight perfectly, with any number of voices.",
"Is our land exhausted?",
"Such was our attitude when the war burst upon the world.",
"I know that now men treat me with respect and attention, such as their wives rarely, if ever, receive from them.",
"He never is familiar with it, or thinks of it or speaks of it as his slave.",
"If they could not touch his hand, they could pass before him and give one glance at his eyes.",
"In a rapid glance at its contents, it appears fully to bear out the promise of the first.",
"Complete service to their country in this crisis may lead women to that economic freedom which will change a political possession into a political power.",
"She is a very human creature.",
"Our men are definitely urging women to a position of economic independence.",
"There was another scream.",
"See all those flags?",
"The man took a last careful glance around the room and then disappeared.",
"With the bridge, wheel and engine room in our possession, we can run the vessel back into the harbor.",
"There was an extra violent crash and it seemed that the door must burst open.",
"When they were married their wives became friends.",
"As far as that goes, there is no suggestion that he walked into a trap.",
"His wife burst out crying when she saw me, and she told me that her husband had cleared out last night after he came home from court.",
"He put them back because he was afraid that if the police found them in his possession, they would think he had a hand in the murder.",
"As I was falling I thought what a nice trap I would be in if I broke my leg and had to lie there until the police came.",
"On that point the driver of the taxi was absolutely certain.",
"There was but one room on this floor where a fire could be lit.",
"Turning, I let my glance fall first on the feet.",
"His hat had blown off, and was lying close up against the fence in front of me.",
"As he did so, he took a glance at the house.",
"She did not intend to take her patient back that night.",
"There was nothing to inform her.",
"Could I hope for a glance of her eye?",
"The mutual glance struck fire.",
"Until now, he had never known the delight of pursuing and killing at will, even though he did not eat all he killed.",
"He was exhausted.",
"He had bent down close to the edge of the water when something caught his attention on the wet sand.",
"He could tell their age, their value, and a part of their history at a glance.",
"He grew weaker.",
"When the sun rises he starts and follows the trail again.",
"When the sun rises look it in the face.",
"My story is finished before my resources are exhausted.",
"He gained the desert and left for a moment his wife and the slave woman.",
"His hand to his head, he bent his good ear to listen.",
"Perhaps these statistics are biased, but the statistics presented by the opposing party were even more fantastic.",
"He seemed to have hardly been in bed an hour, when he woke with his arm at full length, and the pulling going on as if it would pull him out of bed.",
"Having got out a few more stones, they began to fancy they heard a curious sound, which they agreed was more like that of running water than anything else they could think of.",
"But he would not have a close pipe running through his room.",
"It was a very warm night, with a soft breath of south wind blowing, and there was no risk of her taking cold.",
"He caught me by the arms and bent until his face was close to mine.",
"A glance at his face brought me to my feet.",
"It took but a glance to read the story.",
"The horses had grown every day weaker, and many of them were already dead.",
"And then, of a sudden, the meaning of their absence burst upon me.",
"He was fast growing weaker.",
"There was another burst of blood from his nose and mouth.",
"Once there, we closed the trap and waited.",
"This ruined body!",
"Efforts to persuade him to organize with any political party have never succeeded except in isolated cases.",
"They sang and we sang.",
"Their horses at the finish were quite exhausted.",
"In the early morning I woke up and looked out.",
"As for the working classes, and the country populations of both countries, what they have seen of each other, as brothers in arms during the war, may well prove of more lasting importance than anything else.",
"With him I drove slowly through the beautiful town, looking at the ruined houses, which are fairly frequent in its streets.",
"All our stores were soon exhausted.",
"The portion of the wood which we had already exhausted seemed to be the most likely point.",
"By reason of family secrets, perhaps.",
"That they were buried under the stairs, and some stones cast upon them.",
"But their progress was very slow, and their stock of water nearly exhausted.",
"Why should boys be hired to pray, and women to sing for me?",
"In between the efforts of the band our men sang.",
"One of the guns had been blown up, a second badly damaged.",
"Pray do not be overcome.",
"Pray remember that I keep my word.",
"Pray take him away.",
"He cast a quick glance around the room, and seemed satisfied that we were quite alone.",
"Pray excuse me if I do not discuss it.",
"I felt his glance, but I could not meet it.",
"These stones would show no signs.",
"Pray do not put the worst construction on my words.",
"The latter did not meet his glance, but put a finger on those thin lips.",
"Name of a pipe!",
"The woman burst into tears.",
"Pen laughed and declined to tell her.",
"Pen went.",
"It seemed as if the slave had put to death first his master, and then himself.",
"From that moment he was her slave.",
"If we could feed ourselves by making bread of stones, would not that make us proud enough?",
"They earn their own ruin by the very laws of human nature.",
"For what has a slave to do with pride?",
"In defending him, they defended it.",
"It is not religion only which must be taught through the wives and mothers, but sound science also, and sound economy.",
"I say nothing of the rivers, for who could number them?",
"It was, as he would remember, just such a storm which had ruined him in the previous summer.",
"Whatever had prevented him, that task was not undertaken.",
"None of them could marry, of course none of them could have wives and families.",
"Give up this race, or we are ruined.",
"But money would ruin her.",
"The next effort would be even weaker.",
"He stopped to light his pipe, and then slowly walked away, leaving an embarrassed group behind him.",
"But I like me old style girl who make scream.",
"So far as fresh facts are concerned, the theme may fairly be considered exhausted.",
"Pray send me a copy.",
"Pray say so to both.",
"Pray, like it very much.",
"At the station I found a crowd of wives, children, and friends of those who were going away.",
"It woke up many memories of days gone by.",
"But secrets get out, and people pass them along.",
"Why was she so structured about things?",
"There, she saw a strange creature looking at her and wearing a painted smile on his face.",
"The probability is that few women will go there, and they only the wives of the officers of the ships.",
"But it is well to state clearly the nature of her work, and the spirit in which it was undertaken.",
"Also, they do know how to pray!",
"To inform the understanding is a work of time, and must, with children, proceed by slow degrees as they are able to bear it.",
"But still her mind was busy and her pen active, especially on subjects of a religious character.",
"Pray for me.",
"Here she stands, take but possession of her with a touch!",
"His crime had been the revealing of state secrets.",
"When I was first in possession of this wonderful secret, my heart burned to reveal it.",
"What a night for a pipe and a long chair!",
"Every river has, moreover, its influence, which extends to the people who pass their lives within sight of its waters.",
"She was pretending to read it.",
"A woman who is pretending to sleep usually does so in becoming attitudes.",
"It is an art soon acquired and soon abused.",
"She would brush it herself.",
"She sat down by the fire, brush in hand.",
"He was surrounded by papers, and the pen in his large, firm hand moved rapidly over the sheet before him.",
"Of course there are the nurses, and a couple of students.",
"He took a pipe and a chair, and entered into some ordinary conversation.",
"Brush the larger pieces over with the white of an egg, and place one of the smaller pieces on each.",
"Their efforts grew weaker and weaker.",
"One felt that she could be loved and trusted with the whole heart and judgment.",
"We pray to be conventional.",
"Could this be a human creature?",
"He woke up.",
"It will consist mostly of country dishes.",
"He left again immediately, and she was quite sure that he did not intend to return for a long while.",
"An interview lasting a considerable time took place that afternoon.",
"Who will repair the ruin he leaves behind?",
"I had arranged the paper so that the doctor could take in the contents of the heading at the first glance.",
"Each one had some word to send to his parents or family, and when speaking of their wives and children almost every one was affected to tears.",
"Many of them were killed as they were in the act of firing or loading.",
"Everything goes to confirm this feeling, instead of opposing it.",
"Indeed, that is not a free country in which there are any secrets.",
"We have no secrets from each other.",
"The stem bent, but was too tough to break.",
"I waited till a cloud came driving across the moon and leaving all in darkness.",
"They surprise and get possession of the western capital, and there settle down to pass the winter.",
"Every power was bent to the work of rule.",
"For the most part they seem to have preserved their ancient customs.",
"Lovely, lasting peace of mind!",
"Lovely, lasting peace, appear!",
"Sang, song.",
"This belief was based on the idea that he had possession of much more than his rival.",
"Most of these classes are not found at all on the other side, and so far as they are found they are much fewer and weaker than ours.",
"There was not even the change of night and day, of sun and stars, of cloud or clear sky.",
"The creature that was to carry my unusual weight was the most powerful of all, but I felt some doubt whether even his strength might not break down.",
"National and international are not opposing principles.",
"He meant to ruin me.",
"He lied.",
"He bent his glance again to the road ahead.",
"She gave him such a glance as he had never received in his life.",
"He was ruined.",
"Few secrets had she ever kept from her father.",
"He was beaten and bent back.",
"Reserves were close behind.",
"If there were really more than he claimed in his going, he certainly did not intend to tell her.",
"Sweet it was to touch him as she bent with eyes hidden.",
"This morning we went to a slave market.",
"The others are in the slave quarters, a half mile away.",
"Then there would be no scream, no alarm.",
"A glance told everything.",
"The girl was harder to manage, yet, when I left her alone, she lay down on her bed of flags.",
"There is no way to find its secrets but to break it open.",
"The boys were just about to turn their attention once more to the work that had been undertaken when all of them suddenly stopped and listened.",
"The woods boy laughed as though quite pleased because his trap had worked well enough to call forth such words of praise from these new friends.",
"King came on, breaking his way through the brush.",
"She was in a trap.",
"Her hair had blown across his face.",
"Her voice broke into a scream.",
"She wanted to scream at him.",
"She saw him glance at his watch.",
"She must go with him, do what he told her like a slave, as he had said, or he would make her.",
"There came a space of time, all too brief, during which her heart sang within her.",
"Again and again her scream broke from her.",
"They have no voice but the wind, and no sound of them rises up to the high places.",
"The first effect of cloud study is a sense of presence and intention in storm processes.",
"They came into my possession in this way.",
"The ruin, from its position and features, is a most impressive object.",
"He had to take out the broken pipe, and put in a new piece.",
"And then, one morning, when they woke up, the ground was deeply covered with white snow.",
"Makes them smaller and weaker than men, too, which also makes its appeal.",
"The women are gaining every day.",
"He wanted to get up and scream.",
"He gave his boy into the arms of one of his friends, and loading his gun, he stood with the other, to defend the passage to the shore.",
"We were abused and threatened wherever we went.",
"They all came and bent over me, as I lay on the floor in my corner.",
"That made him well again, and no one seemed to think it was a great deal of trouble to take for a creature that was nothing but a dog.",
"It was a pretty little creature, and I did not wonder that they thought so much of it.",
"I had never seen such a creature before.",
"Wood said that it was blowing up rain.",
"He had only his birds left, and he was a ruined man.",
"She burst into tears.",
"All eyes were bent toward them.",
"She struck her hands together above her head, and burst into a flood of tears.",
"It is of frame, with a deep front gallery over which the roof extends.",
"The winter rain gets into the ground, and does by the rock what it has done by the stones of many an old building.",
"What, then, brought the stones?",
"But what caused so vast a destruction of animal life along that beach, must remain one of the buried secrets of the past.",
"What to a living creature is freedom?",
"The only soil we know of, the real foundation stones of our being and living, are the cells we are made of.",
"With each wave, the pressure within it rises.",
"They make, at a certain level, good slave drivers because they feel within themselves a driving force.",
"Somebody has removed those boards and laid a fine trap.",
"He moved his gun forward again as though bent on shooting.",
"Let it be granted that that will be a difficult control to organize.",
"I have lied.",
"Ill news travels fast.",
"Who ever trusted woman?",
"It made me feel kind of funny, because all the while I knew where those coins came from.",
"All of a sudden I heard a sound and saw a face and the hair round the face was all hanging down and it gave me a scare, kind of.",
"Honest, that kid is a scream.",
"The door had blown shut!",
"But it is always easier to fall into a trap than to get out of it.",
"It is a trap.",
"And I trusted him so!",
"He says her father and mother pray for her night and day.",
"If it did not, where would it come in, pray?",
"Sometimes it is hard work to pray until we get an answer and then it is harder still to find out its meaning.",
"I think he trusted in himself, people trusted him so much that he began to trust himself.",
"I intend to get to the bottom of this affair, if I possibly can.",
"They were almost exhausted, but very happy, and they showed their new presents with great pride.",
"He bent his head to meet the left hand which he raised with difficulty, then he tried to light a match.",
"He bent and looked at them.",
"For the master was indeed talking of the secrets of his craft.",
"He had never talked like this to any living creature.",
"It was impossible, after a single glance, to imagine this man failing.",
"But what else is every thinking creature, male or female?",
"He kept on ordering things and they came before him.",
"He had come home from his travels!",
"It was so much the worse for the poor, if they were bent on remaining poor.",
"She herself burst into a laugh.",
"But all at once a scream arose.",
"What will ruin me is my good heart.",
"So saying, he gave him a gay, meaning glance.",
"A cry of extraordinary delight burst forth.",
"A racing stable which he set up quickly helped on his ruin.",
"Either he must close this trap or return to his post.",
"With our laws and customs there can be no substantial fortune unless a family is limited to one son.",
"At last with difficulty he succeeded in taking his pipe from his mouth.",
"They are found only at the surface of the water, where the temperature must be above the freezing point.",
"A movement of arms and feet teaches her that the child feels its strength and wants to use it.",
"An enormous immigrant population is pressing upon us.",
"What, are these soldiers bent to die with me?",
"Play right, I pray.",
"Kiss him, I pray?",
"Search him, I know him not, he is some slave.",
"So they went out together, and he had never seen such a mad creature in all his life as his wife was then.",
"Anybody would have picked him out at a glance for a lawyer, and a good one.",
"Did she scream?",
"To begin with, there was the question of customs relations.",
"Its one export is gold.",
"Through these machines run rivers of oil.",
"Glance back over it all.",
"Still later, all soldiers were allowed to express their political preferences.",
"Unfortunately, my forecast has come true in every particular.",
"He said he hoped to give me a surprise, he trusted a pleasant one, during the summer.",
"They took off their hats to each other with rather more ceremony than when they had last met.",
"Many have been ruined by success, because it took them by surprise.",
"She did as she was told and bent over him.",
"That valley is a trap.",
"He continued his task after a very quick glance up at her.",
"He pointed down into the valley with his pen.",
"He lifted his pen from the paper, but did not look up.",
"Both the daughters sang.",
"But in its own world do we feel the creature is so very bad?",
"I am a poor pen at that same.",
"I never failed to mark the difference on entering a slave state.",
"It is not among the higher classes that the possession of slaves produces the worst effects.",
"I speak not of these, but of the population generally, as seen in town and country, among the rich and the poor, in the slave states, and the free states.",
"During my first few days at his shop, my work was only to watch the tanks, clean those which were dirty, remove the dead fish and do some other small jobs.",
"I cleaned the tanks, replaced the pump, checked the filters and showed the hotel staff how to feed the fish.",
"The shop assistant told me that as they were expecting fish the following weekend almost all their tanks were empty.",
"I found it right at the bottom of all the other big tanks.",
"In similar fashion I set up fish tanks for a few other family friends.",
"Besides having a lot of fun and gaining valuable experience, I also earned pocket money!",
"Thus is a people gradually exhausted, for the most part, with little effect.",
"He examined the observations of other men, but trusted only to his own.",
"He appears to me rather to propose an experiment than a law, and rather to intend the improvement of policy, than the safety of the people.",
"Is the nation ruined?",
"Let us, however, pray for each other, and hope to see one another yet from time to time with mutual delight.",
"Pray how shall I wind up?",
"From down the street on both sides anxious looks were bent upon the scene by many of our leading citizens.",
"I knew the truth in a glance.",
"One false step might ruin all!",
"One spot on the card has brought ruin.",
"And we learn, above all, to brush the things together without loss of time and to play a new hand with the same old hope.",
"When I woke up the firing was far off.",
"So the good people pushed and trusted and pushed.",
"A cry of amazed protest burst from the girls.",
"But nurses we could not have at so advanced a post as this.",
"I have heard much of his murders, and of the manner in which those up above bear with him.",
"Satisfied with this prospect, he bent his eye beneath.",
"He had frequently touched in his conversations on the customs of the different countries he had seen.",
"Ought we not to look more to the possession of principles than to the possession of wealth?",
"But how differently are we situated!",
"And she, sweet creature!",
"He bent over the head, but one look was sufficient.",
"She is gone, in a cloud, like the star of the night!",
"A slave has not the freedom even to do the right thing.",
"The slave owner is always more hurt than the slave.",
"Moreover, suppose there had been such a man, what a poor, modern creature he would be compared with me!",
"She was one of the few wives to whom I told my story.",
"What shall I do, but pray for more strength to be made able to do all that may be required of me.",
"He then requested him to take possession of some letters he would try to write and, if possible, send them.",
"Though a slave in fact, he lived in hope of soon being a free man.",
"His men were exhausted, and threw themselves down anywhere and everywhere.",
"For the first time she wrote me with reserves.",
"Then he lit a cigarette and sat down at his desk.",
"He took up his pen and began to write rapidly.",
"He insisted upon ordering wine.",
"He passed without a glance at either of them.",
"He had a horrible feeling that this was some trap.",
"Through a cloud of smoke I saw all the pleasant years that were gone.",
"Between ourselves the market is getting weaker every day.",
"The poor creature revealed herself to me during the next few minutes as I feel sure she had never revealed herself to her husband.",
"Suffered to escape, we might inform the police.",
"Beneath her steady glance his blue eyes fell.",
"I took possession of that the day after the murder.",
"I woke suddenly and looked at him.",
"This could hardly be done without reference to some of the principal phases of the religious history of the nation.",
"Sure source of lasting happiness!",
"On one occasion I forgot the cloud shadow in a strange notion to catch up with my own shadow.",
"They were from that class of white men who wore big hats and carried large hearts, they said.",
"This possession assured me of friends wherever I should go.",
"Looking in from where he stood, with one sweeping glance, he asked if I lacked anything for my room.",
"Turning to my mother, she offered her the pipe.",
"Faster and faster I ran with my load for my father, but the sounds were gaining upon me.",
"They saw again a rolling black cloud spread itself over the land.",
"The old bent woman appears at the entrance way.",
"He yet trusted that help would come to his people before it was too late.",
"Behind him, in the distance, he saw a cloud of dust.",
"Anything which could be found out by thinking I never was told, until I had exhausted my efforts to find it out for myself.",
"Some of the big stones have been washed down.",
"Suddenly she bent forward.",
"He bent over her until his lips nearly touched hers.",
"I am ruined!",
"By one and all the dead man was blamed for the ruin in which he had involved them.",
"He got his pipe and felt in his pocket for his matches.",
"When he came to a certain place after going down of the sun and would rest there all night, he took of the stones that were there and laid under his head and slept in the same place.",
"But he thought little on the stones, for he thought on other things.",
"And the father burst into tears.",
"Then the prisoner burst into tears.",
"The loading of each vehicle occupied nearly half an hour.",
"Will it burst forth again?",
"At this point the street rises.",
"It was well defended.",
"In the meanwhile, they heard the soldiers, who were pursuing them, coming up.",
"They were pursuing him.",
"The brains of an army cannot be blown out.",
"The cloud passes away, the star is seen once more.",
"It is of great importance to us to know, whether they used their freedom properly, or whether they abused it.",
"A merely political friend can never be trusted.",

"Then the fellow sang a funny song.",
"A rain of stones came towards them.",
"Delay meant ruin, and his cousin had trusted everything to him.",
"News travels very rapidly indeed in the country.",
"Now, what is possession of a slave?",
"Others required much urging.",
"Just as he reached the ticket window, the pursuing vehicle stopped below.",
"Something at one of the port windows had caught his glance.",
"The ocean, in front, failed to answer the latter question, and his glance turned.",

"It lit a fire in my brain.",
"I might have seen all at a glance as I came in, before the light of my last match was blown out by the wind, had not the door as I opened it formed a screen between me and the dead man on the floor.",
"I shall be well defended.",
"Then I laid the envelope with the note I had written where he could not help finding it at first or second glance.",
"It is the privilege of everybody to do a reasonable amount of kicking, especially if the person has been a long time with one concern and has received many benefits.",
"When I from black, and he from white cloud free.",
"One rather large creature stood up to reveal a body of the same substance.",
"It can reach to a distant area or stay situated close by.",
"There are few words more abused.",
"Let us glance for a moment at the most important applications of the principle.",
"But many of his descriptions are given with a bright pen.",
"My slave has it.",
"I heard her tell the slave to go again and not return without him!",
"A slave came.",
"We can use no weaker expression.",
"Poor old stones!",
"But she told him her name as one tells something of another and more remote creature.",
"So was his understanding glance.",
"She had been a slave, it is true, but had seen good days to what the slaves down the river saw.",
"I knew at a glance that she was going away.",
"These were only given to permit the slave to go from the farm of his own master to that of another.",
"I was bent on freedom, and would try for it again.",
"A fellow slave was taken ill, and I was called on to care for him at night.",
"They visited several offices before the boy, who seemed to estimate men at a glance, found one that satisfied him.",

"Nor do I know that they are bent on war at all.",
"Whether I shall always pray for the king is another matter.",
"I intend to go out myself, at the head of all the white men that remain, in order to deliver him from the hands of his enemies.",
"That sudden shadow is not of the passing cloud.",
"They rise and pray.",
"To them the possession of the soil was a fixed idea.",
"Any creature, which can hear, smell, taste, feel, or see, may take note of its signals, if he can understand them.",
"I do not intend to do it again.",
"Surely she did not intend to continue her opposition?",
"She makes me want to scream!",
"The people that make faces and scream.",
"I never scream.",
"My imagination bothers me.",
"Her glance claimed him.",
"There was no need, she felt, to specify further.",
"For a tiny second his glance met hers.",

"He had not come well out into the open, and was clearly keeping near cover and working parallel to the brush.",
"It was my thought always to keep a wounded bear from getting into the brush, as the blood trail would have ruined future shooting.",
"They must be attractive, however, as there is a considerable population of white men here who have taken native wives.",
"I have often thrown stones at them, and sometimes it was quite a while before I could get them to start.",
"A little cloud of dust arose and she appeared to be buried to her knees in the slide rock.",
"Where this is the case, the farmers who live on the lower stretches of the stream, being without water to put on their land, can raise no crops.",
"It was absolute ruin.",
"It was very dark outside, and a cold wind was blowing up.",
"The boy needed no further urging.",
"Then it occurred to him that perhaps he might get possession of the boy, and permanent possession at that.",
"I knew that he must be quite exhausted after so great a strain upon his nervous system.",
"The poor creature had gone there, no doubt, to find good air.",
"Do not signal for a taxi near houses.",
"We do not think our contemporary ought to give away military secrets like this.",
"People may walk, but not throw stones at birds.",
"It is situated on a pretty dry spot, and there is a fine walk to it.",
"They could not inform him here.",
"There was a double circle, one of very large, the other of smaller stones.",

"The name is exhausted by what we see.",
"It is situated in a rich bottom.",
"Pray be calm.",
"His clear eyes, his bright, yet steady glance, inspired confidence.",
"A bone may be bent, or only partly broken, or split.",
"But exercise, like everything else which contributes to our welfare, may be carried to excess.",

"This incident made a lasting impression.",
"He occupied the same corner for many weeks, and changed his place only when a different arrangement of stones was made.",
"His ruin was complete.",
"The physical character of the next generation rises in consequence.",
"We never tell our secrets to people that pump for them.",
"All the heads bent and there was a silence.",
"She did not easily forget her scare, in fact, she never got over it.",
"She was a kind creature.",
"Nothing seemed wrong with him, yet weaker and weaker he grew.",

"Dear creature!",
"Excellent creature!",
"I must lay down my pen.",
"When she had got it in her possession, she flew to the door.",
"But the pen is a witness on record.",
"Strange creature!",
"What is it, pray?",
"But when he woke he was cold.",
"It was at that minute they noticed the door had blown open, and that a little boy was standing in it, looking at them.",
"The dead flowers in the garden were hidden under the blowing snow.",
"Why, it would be ruined!",
"Sometimes as they walked through the forest, looking all about, even up into the trees for their mother, they would suddenly burst into play.",
"Then the bird sang.",
"She sang the same words over and over and over.",
"They built a fire to keep from freezing.",
"And from morning to night they made me a slave.",
"She bent now and took his hand.",
"His master had also given him a pass, with which he could go and come on business, and the very feeling that he was trusted kept him from using it to run away with.",
"There were several other coins in it.",
"Then, after a glance at them, he went on binding up his foot.",
"All of a sudden he woke up in his seat, and begun hunting all through his pockets.",
"He paid no attention to the girls, but walked on, with head bent down.",
"I jumped off the train, and went back over the line, thinking the bill might have blown out of the window.",
"I believe that creature has been engaged as much as twice since I left.",
"She bent forward and looked up to see where it had come from.",
"I cannot drink so much, though I should burst.",
"Upon my faith, I do intend good faith.",
"Some have their wives for pleasure, some for need.",
"I am urging a matter of simple justice.",
"A panic of fear took possession of him.",
"A slave!",
"At first she was much upset by the news, and burst into tears.",
"She bent over him, and took up the magic skin.",
"His face lit up.",
"He would have gone to every soul in the town, and told them that they lied.",
"For the rest he put every man into the plain, that it should be the more strongly held and defended.",
"Engines can move these stones, and by the use of engines we may make them our own.",
"They trusted beyond measure in their strength, and in the strength of their company.",
"For it is a funny song, and he sang it well.",
"I feel just like being lied to.",
"Was it a trap?",
"And the face that bent above the light was the face of one he knew.",
"When the dust cloud passed on it was much larger, and both the man and his horse had disappeared.",
"This last that there might be no risk of the charge blowing out through the hole.",
"In one of the sticks he made a hole.",
"He thought the ground had blown up, and the end of the world come.",
"And as the creature sat in the warm bright sun, a wonderful change came over it.",
"But when I have had my dinner, and looked a little about this pretty place, I will come back, and have a little chat about all I have seen in my travels.",
"And when he woke she was telling the children a story.",
"I am a ruined man!",
"And what was the song which she sang?",
"They were becoming so full and so accurate that the enemy would have paid any sum or have committed any crime to secure possession of them.",
"But he is a poor creature.",
"With her there were no reserves in love.",
"What I shall do when they are exhausted I cannot tell.",
"He had fallen into a trap, but why it had been set he could not guess.",

"Even silver was as plenty as the stones in the streets.",
"The ground should be looked after, and the stones preserved as much as possible.",

"Most excellent schools are situated near and on the northern side of the church.",
"It almost seems too good for the district in which it is situated.",
"Hats usually too warm.",
"Character of nurses.",
"But if it is a great mistake in adults to wear thick, heavy hats, it is much more so in the case of children.",
"In short, if frequent changes are not made, whatever some mothers and nurses may think, they may rest assured, that the health of the child must sooner or later suffer as the consequence.",
"Besides, in what does this smell consist?",
"In this case the counties are not only few, but there is a very striking difference in their shape.",
"Still I say, that there are reasons enough against the practice I am opposing, without this.",
"It is obvious, at the first glance, that the influence of the mother, in our own country, at least, will be less over boys than over girls.",
"These stones had all been broken from their settings and thrown loose in the chest.",
"The story was planned rather than plotted.",
"Duty can fight without calling in reserves from the past and without the vision of victory in the future.",
"My heart rises at the thought.",
"The accused defended himself in person or by counsel.",
"She reserves her arts for another victim.",
"I imagined what my brother said to be true, and bent down my head to look at it.",
"When, having left him also, they went away, it came into my head to kill the old man, and take possession of his chest of provisions.",
"He, by becoming a woman, has ruined the old man.",
"They talked it, and wrote it, and sang it.",
"I burst into a laugh, and they both joined me in it, from surprise.",
"When he and his wife woke the next morning, the box was gone.",
"A few whom he thought it safe to trust were admitted to his secrets.",
"One city of the dead lies beneath the feet, another stretches before the eyes far out of sight.",
"He has lost his property, and he is ruined.",
"The basis of his system was the combining of distinct flags in pairs.",
"Had it been used from the first the line would not have been ruined and might have been used for a considerable period.",
"Pray he must, for the entire company were on their knees, waiting for him to begin.",
"But at the opening of the year we were called to pass under a cloud.",
"The next thing to be done was to organize the financial department.",
"He was not a boy that looked like a creature of dreams and of high resolve.",
"Then he puts his pipe into his pocket.",
"Ruined, I say.",
"The history of her whole life rises up before her.",
"Then her thoughts glance off to the future.",
"She might be bent, but she would never break.",
"But the pen did not help him.",
"Again he took up his pen.",
"Each moment the cloud rises higher and higher.",
"If the war was just and necessary, the circumstances under which it was undertaken were not less promising.",
"Parents and nurses have only to give them something to do, or tell them of something to do, and the thing is put right.",
"I remember picking up one who was walking along a road, and giving him a lift in my trap.",
"Something else took place instead, which seemed to consist at first in the mere closing of her eyes.",
"I tried to pray.",
"No woman, I argued, is what this lovely creature seems.",
"The men removed their hats.",
"At last he ran away into the brush as fast as he could go.",
"His whole figure soon came into view against the background of gray cloud.",
"Simply because all are not of equal strength, and the weaker must go to the wall.",
"It was of no use to resist, and she did not scream.",
"She sat down, and his arm relaxed its hold to pick up his pipe which had fallen on the other side.",
"And how are they to live, pray?",
"I am a creature of temperature.",
"I was too busy rolling stones.",
"On one side of the trail the landscape rises straight up.",
"At the second step I was walking in a cloud.",
"I am so happy, was the song without words he sang.",
"Alone, there in the brush, he worked out his problem and began to apply it.",
"He grew weaker even than before.",
"It was a pretty trap, if trouble blew up.",
"I do not say that he should pray about that.",
"He should pray.",
"I would not leave my rivers in the shadow.",
"It will have to begin with the moral, because everyone will be too much exhausted to read one at the end, and as the moral is the only part that really matters, it is important to come to it quite fresh.",
"She only can command the great secrets of me.",
"There was quite a sea running, though the trade wind was blowing light.",
"He is a chief actor in the terrible drama of a trial, where the life or death of a fellow creature is at issue.",
"She cared very little for their secrets.",
"Living apart, too, was next door to divorce, and who could associate with a creature who had been divorced?",
"What we do want is to get our wives back.",
"That is what bothers me.",
"He was the only living creature within sight.",
"I meant to write such a long, nice letter, but I cannot hold the pen.",
"Pray keep this in case it should be necessary to catch this last chance.",
"Pray write me again.",
"It should give me a fine book of travels, anyway.",
"No place so brands a man.",

"It appeared to be holding on to the bars of the window, and its attitude suggested climbing.",
"In a minute, it seemed, it had reached the tops of the trees, through which I had watched it.",
"It passed above the house, with an extraordinary sailing kind of motion.",
"I often went and was delighted when I could find her alone.",
"There was really no use to continue worrying himself to death and doing no good.",
"To each man I assign his work, his task.",
"To stand apart from it is to be out of step with the march of nations.",
"In our sports I was also his successful competitor.",
"For my part, I was delighted.",
"I never saw anyone more taken with another at first sight, unless, indeed, it was the stranger herself, who seemed quite to have lost her heart to her.",
"It is from this official paper that I have summarized my account of this last shocking scene.",
"He remained staring for a moment at the hook.",
"My only theory was that they had wished to test my strength and determination.",
"Then I would assign them more work to do.",
"We soon grew tired of climbing and turned our attention to the sea.",
"Why, he up and gives us a week shore leave, and then he gives us light watches, and all the time our pay goes on just the same.",
"The others clustered around.",
"The phenomena were related.",
"The question then was between climbing and running.",
"The rows are may be a foot and a half long.",
"Serve hot with potatoes.",
"Only the winds of all the agents he knows seem capable of flowing in the directions indicated by the scoring.",
"Moreover, as far as I know, it had never been climbed.",
"The highest peaks burned like islands in a sea of liquid shade.",
"In general, however, there is no marked dividing line as to size.",
"At this they all rushed for me.",
"It would sink before she saw it!",
"Treat the strangers with every consideration possible under the circumstances.",
"The first night I saw it, I rushed out of bed and made for the spot.",
"The stranger laughed.",
"At the entrance of the town the stranger stopped.",
"He especially delighted in a surprise.",
"She was delighted at this especially.",
"Orders were given, arrangements made, packing was done.",
"She could easily arrange to go with them at once.",
"He hates her.",
"Finally trying several other pockets, he held out his hand with a small coin in it.",

"At another time his friends, believing the end was at hand, gathered round him.",
"She had not moved, still sitting staring above the top of his head.",
"There was a burst of laughter.",
"At length as they turned from the station approach on to the main road the stranger spoke.",
"The stranger gave a short laugh.",
"He had gone to the landing outside the door.",
"The girl was staring in front of her.",
"Unfortunately, there was no corner on the top landing where I could stand hidden, so I was forced to draw back into the room.",
"Somehow or other I had managed to corner a horse near a fence, and had climbed upon his back.",
"I was among entire strangers, and therefore I only bet a small amount.",
"My mother and sisters, who had heard so much about him from me, were delighted to see him and he spent several weeks at our place.",
"The stranger fell dead, shot through the brain.",
"As I was so far ahead of my competitor in the number killed, I thought I could afford to give an extra exhibition of my skill.",
"I asked him if I should not go myself, but he replied that he wished me to remain with the command, as he could not spare me.",
"They appeared as if they wished to raise my hair then and there.",

"Officers and men all were glad to see me, and I was equally delighted to meet them once more.",
"She wished she would go away.",
"We owe a duty to society.",
"He fitted the key in the lock and turned it, then his hand fell by his side.",
"The white men were staring up at the sky.",
"His guide had a fit of laughter, and then turned to go.",
"Each man sat as still as death, listening, staring, waiting.",
"What was she staring at?",
"Then they took up the line of march again.",
"That surprising stranger simply stood there laughing, and holding out the rest of a fine fat fish!",
"The stranger spoke low and quietly.",
"The stranger was very angry at this new turn in the dog deal.",
"He saw it, long before he lowered her.",
"He seemed almost a stranger nowadays.",
"After lunch the washing up is to be done in a beautiful new white sink which is displayed with pride.",
"A second interesting phase of the transition period was the method adopted for the training of the senses.",
"We will suppose that not being at school he is free to arrange his own day, sometimes alone, and sometimes with other children, or with his parents.",
"It is life he has experienced, and he seeks for more life.",
"The guards turned out.",
"Both men had their guards up.",
"From within came a sound of speech and laughter, and I was in half a mind to turn back to my cold quarters by the shore.",
"The sight of the girl held them staring.",
"He seemed actually to gain a yard, and now he was near enough for us to see his white face and staring eyes.",
"He has seen the white man pressing up from the sea, and spreading over the lands of his fathers.",
"She bent down to examine the lock, then fitted the key into it.",
"Certainly he ought to, when he knows all that his grandmother did, and what her intentions must have been.",
"And if she had seen anything, she said to herself, what was that to those strangers?",
"We must not weigh them down, but only help them when it is seen that there is need for it.",
"But this was far above what she could do, for she too was not much more than a stranger, and had little strength.",
"He kept in the shade, and did not look at me more than he could help.",
"The girls would have been delighted.",
"I lifted my own light to see his face as I rushed forward.",
"There are, I believe, some cousins, distant cousins, whom he hates.",
"I persuaded him to go to bed.",
"His manner retained its shade of distance and offense.",
"We should have general intentions and particular intentions.",
"But the stranger had disappeared.",
"We are really on the march at last.",
"Everybody embraced everybody else.",
"If she could only learn his intentions!",
"It was silent laughter.",
"It was perfectly natural throughout, except that she should have been trusted so entirely to a stranger.",
"They remained silent, staring at each other.",
"A sudden thought rushed over her, and her cry told where her heart really lay, at least at this time.",
"What work did she assign to him in her imagination?",
"They were staring at us as though wondering who we were.",
"I sat down, staring at the dead man, and tried to collect my senses.",
"He burst into laughter as he saw our faces.",
"And he went away down the hall, leaving me staring after him.",
"Shade himself was reported to be doing extremely well.",
"Shade stopped immediately for that.",
"Shade worked in silence for a moment.",
"And what are the wings of the soul?",

"They were sailing away toward their homes.",
"One day he went to the house of the rich man to borrow books.",
"As we read him, we cannot help believing that these things actually happened.",
"They might even be persuaded to receive a bit more.",
"Follow, pursue, chase.",
"The shocking scene is to this day fresh in my mind, and I have often been overcome while thinking on it.",
"He was persuaded she did not belong there.",
"He wondered whether she felt her meeting him was something of an adventure, but he was persuaded she was playing a part.",
"It was obvious that climbing needed study.",
"They valued a high place in business and social circles and their good name.",
"When we get on board well weigh them against this lot.",
"She wanted to see him and was persuaded that for him to see her would not hurt.",
"How much more, then, it requires different intentions of the eye and of the mind to attend to different departments of knowledge!",
"She wished that she were dead.",
"What if I should ring the bell?",
"I had wished to, still earlier in the morning.",
"I heard the second bell ring.",
"Military life is equally new to the soldier, for which none of his previous education or experience has fitted him.",
"He is an old story, he says, and hates to show on these occasions.",
"To win, behind the armed forces must stand determined peoples.",
"Most of the effective work was started in volunteer societies and had proved a success before there was an official laying on of hands.",
"War and the chase gave them their first lessons in cooperation, nor has war been a bad teacher for women.",

"The chase was on.",
"With the thought, he rushed from the room.",
"This was a story which all wished to hear.",
"Perhaps he wished to hear it, too.",
"She was just laying down a bunch of keys on the table in the lower hall.",
"He wished that his master would come back into the strange room where he had left him.",
"He was staring at the girl.",
"He could see the laughter in her face and eyes, the laughter that had made him warm and happy.",
"Like all her breed, she would face fire and death before water.",
"From east and west, south and north, all trails led to the post.",
"The water rushed into his mouth, his ears, eyes and nose.",
"There is a river which flows from there to the sea.",
"He gave her the wings of a bird, and she flew up in the sky.",
"Just like a bird who tries to lift its wings!",
"He lived upon nothing but the chase.",
"He climbed up the sides of the hole.",
"Now it is not my purpose to set down all we did and said during this long chase.",
"Nothing can help the cause of peace more than giving a full knowledge of the real situation to the various peoples.",
"We know what we owe to victory and we are ready to pay the price of our defeat.",
"There is food for our laughter and our tears.",
"The gift of reading, he said, was too good a thing to give him before he wished to have it, or knew the value of it.",
"He stood staring at it for a while.",
"He concluded already that it was a difficult thing to make a machine which should do just what the maker wished.",
"The sight of her in the arms of a stranger brought me to my senses, and I stopped dead where I was.",
"I could have embraced him.",
"The answer came in the morning, when the order was given to march as usual.",
"A copy of them lies before me now, and even at this day, when I scan again the plan of march, I do not see how it could be improved.",
"A division, apparently, on the march.",
"One cannot do much by way of heating, as there is no coal.",
"He was delighted to see me.",
"The former are, indeed, rather types of what he wished to be than what he was.",
"She could do many things, and above all she could show him new and wonderful things in the hills where she wished to keep him always with her.",
"Seeing me, however, and believing me to be a customer, he turned and closed the door quickly.",
"The paper was of foreign make, with blue lines ruled in squares.",
"Our host told them his name, and asked why they wished to enter.",
"I resolved to approach the subject later, so as to allow him time to question me if he wished to do so.",
"Then I rushed forward and faced him.",
"Thus sailing along the coast, we discovered every day a great number of people, speaking various languages.",
"The play of light and shade in the distance was very wonderful.",
"When we started it was still raining.",
"It was raining again and the roads were blocked.",
"He was as delighted as a child, and I too was very glad.",
"There were no bridges, and the water was breast high in some places.",
"The long, brown rows of books still lined the walls of the morning room.",
"I wished that it was light enough to see his face.",
"I think he was staring into the night before him and listening, as I had been.",
"He heard her pull the bell.",
"It could neither be climbed nor avoided.",
"He noticed the stranger at once, and elected to walk past him.",
"There was no one man who could dominate them all and concentrate their strength against the enemy.",
"It was found to be a relief to the eyes against the snow, if the soldiers kept something black before them on the march, and to the feet, if they kept constantly in motion, and allowed themselves no rest, and if they took off their shoes in the night.",
"But the will to make them healthy is not here, and they are left to breed disease and death.",
"It is essential, however, that the flower be found by accident, for he who seeks it never finds it.",
"To sink forgotten to the dead?",
"At this terrible sight our senses left us and we lay like dead men.",
"As for him, believing me to be dead it was no wonder that he had not recognized me.",
"I only wished to end my days in peace.",
"Poet, never chase the dream.",
"But it is an evidence of her good intentions.",
"She touched a bell beside her.",
"Now she reached out a hand and touched her bell.",
"The stranger made no reply.",
"It appears to me as if I should die with joy at the first landing in a foreign country.",
"He would not begin with strangers.",
"Of course, there is not any special quarter where they are clustered in such a manner as to show their condition as a whole.",
"But, because of the magic in the colored lights, she knew just enough to keep her from realizing the truth about her identity.",
"And although he was going to use this opportunity to escape, he almost wished he could stay to see the whole thing through.",
"He wished he could have known her.",
"Some people like to doubt the reality of certain phenomena that appears quite obvious to others.",
"She, after all, had the ability to transport herself to any land she wished.",
"I think we owe her a bit more respect than that.",
"But now, as he sat staring at the wall, he wished that they would not come.",
"A little beyond the landing they formed their companies and made their preparations for the last and longest stage of their journey.",
"Machines were destroyed, and the houses of those employers who had lowered wages were set on fire.",
"Or more to be valued, loved, and delighted in?",
"One can easily understand how many calls there were now on her, as, her marriage being not altogether a happy one, she had to arrange the education of her children.",
"All around her delighted to ease her suffering and to minister to her comfort.",
"But at the last moment, when the ship was on the point of sailing, she felt that she could not leave, and ordered her things to be taken back to the city again.",
"The others had followed, and sat round to hear what the stranger could have to read to them.",
"I am but a stranger in these parts.",
"I shall never forget how delighted I was at the first sight of the house.",
"At first I thought that all eyes were upon me, and that because I was a stranger.",
"But he did not lower the windows and look out, as any man might have wished to do on returning to the place of his birth.",
"No mention was made of the fact that his message had implied, and she had understood, that he wished to see her alone.",
"No, but a man, and shall weigh evidence.",
"Where is her laughter now?",
"Anybody can sell if the buyer means to call off the order by the next mail.",
"He too was a stranger.",
"When anything prevents this, the host will usually lead off the dance with the lady who is either the highest in rank, or the greatest stranger.",
"Of the latter kind are the senses of touch and taste, which are believed to be very slightly developed.",
"With all these conditions, however, birds could not fly without wings.",
"Before laying this preparation on the cake, great care must be taken that it is nice and smooth, which is easily accomplished by well beating the mixture.",
"If the tops of them become too brown, cover them with paper until they are done through.",
"For her own comfort, a good nurse will frequently vary this position, by changing from one arm to the other, and sometimes by laying it across both, raising the head a little.",
"The following will be found to answer all the intentions desired.",
"It is, therefore, important to have this settled in the insurance clause.",
"Stranger things have happened.",
"Then they rushed into the school house.",
"As soon as possible he rushed away, after having given his promise not to come home late.",
"He had not rushed in ahead of the others according to his custom.",
"When the visitors arrived, they immediately stood before the open door of the room used for packing.",
"But an uncle knows how to arrange things and that is why he is here.",
"Quickly the children rushed to meet them.",
"How could a stranger hear about it?",
"The officer climbed out with an effort, his eyes fixed on the place.",
"They rushed across the border.",
"They closed in and lowered boats.",
"Through the middle of it flows the great river, passing from the east to the west.",
"Then they each chose such of the band as they wished, and so went forth by different paths from the forest.",
"So they sat staring at one another for a long time, until the stranger broke the silence suddenly.",
"I watched them out of sight, then looked for the stranger, but I found that he, too, was gone.",
"When the bell began to ring he arose and passed out of his house, closing the door behind him.",
"Then began a really horrible chase.",
"From right and left they rushed at me.",
"When I recovered my senses I was in the guard room.",
"They gave him such service as they wished or as they must.",
"The scene took place beneath the shade of an old forest.",
"Thus both horse and foot kept their course and order of march as they began, in close ranks at a gentle pace, that the one might not pass or separate from the other.",
"And there seems to have been a shade of difference among the members of this party.",
"We know this, and our knowledge of it is the debt that we owe to our dead.",
"Shocking thought!",
"Bell, flower.",
"They did not think of being held to blame because they were killing a few, but wished to receive additional praise for not putting more out of the way.",
"Again, from those who had lands they took away half of the proceeds.",
"Hence no one of the private citizens saved anything worth mentioning.",
"Previously he had wished to avoid using it, in order to gain possession of the money.",
"Their brother responded just as they hoped he would, and the twins were greatly delighted with the success of their plan.",
"The stranger suddenly remembered something.",
"It appeared to me as if he wished to read the character and perhaps the thoughts of his guest.",
"If he wished to find her in fault he would have to watch her dreams.",
"The chambers also are very much smaller than those of good private houses.",
"We were received on landing by our former host and conducted to his house.",
"This shade of meaning requires attention.",
"Everybody rushed on to the road, and the police were pushed aside.",
"With feelings of joy I changed into my uniform and rushed to join my company.",
"Hence the introduction of this clause is not a new demand.",
"That much we owe to our children and their children.",
"He wished she had not been kind.",
"The strangers passed on down the road without looking back.",
"Long she sat there, staring out into the night.",
"The gray shade left her face.",
"They would all owe it to him.",
"He would go, but he wished it need not be.",
"He had made no mention of his intentions.",
"Slowly he went back to the old house and climbed the stairs.",
"He sure rushed it.",
"That air game would just suit me, if I were fitted for it.",
"After that the order to march!",
"With all her spirit and energy she had thrown herself into the organizing of the women of the valley to work for the interests of the war.",
"I was perfectly delighted, and think it the finest picture I have yet seen.",
"The iron mounting seemed to me good.",
"It appeared safe enough for me to adventure alone, and I was at least determined to assure myself as to the identity of these strangers.",
"He ignored the one thing I most desired to learn, but I did not press it, believing I knew the answer already.",
"At first our resistance was blind enough, guided only by the senses of touch and sound.",
"We have been sailing to the north of west since taking to the boat.",
"They all wished him luck.",
"Stranger things than that have happened.",
"Could it be possible that he was taking leave of his senses?",
"We will borrow it of them.",
"She saw him in a new, bright light, as one may see for the first time a stranger on whom much depends.",
"She looked so little like laughter!",
"And, as both had cause to regard the situation, there was so little call for laughter.",
"She stood staring at him with wide eyes.",
"So, believing that she would be grateful for silence, he grew silent with her.",
"He had but half a mind to give to physical senses.",
"She climbed on.",
"Yet he had time to weigh her words and draw from each one his own significance.",
"She waited, her eyes staring.",
"I am persuaded only a complex soul can get any good of a plain religion.",
"We have a natural sequence, if we begin with the earliest and go on to the latest readings.",
"Poetry cannot, in the nature of things, be a mere register of phenomena appealing to the eye or the ear.",
"Had I wished to make a picture of this scene I had thrown much less light into it.",
"But still she wondered what experiences other people had had, and wished that someone would talk to her about it.",
"The people she knew would be harder to speak to than strangers.",
"They are not fitted for it.",
"From the house came sounds of laughter and many voices.",
"It was easy to see that he wished to accept the invitation.",
"Her mouth was half open, her eyes were staring.",
"I stood in the stable door, staring at her with all my might.",
"She held out her fingers and talked gently, so that if it wished to come to her it could.",
"They knew we were strangers.",
"She wished to give her a valuable present, and this would always be worth a great deal of money.",
"A boy stood by this table with his hand on a bell.",
"There used to be a sign board to tell strangers about it, but it had been taken away.",
"Then he would be delighted to see her.",
"Wood, and stood staring at him.",
"No distinguished stranger was allowed to miss them.",
"The step behind her now might be the fall of that very shoe.",
"He rushed to his table, and began to write.",
"We want to get an answer to one strange question, and we have found a group of questions stranger still, and got them answered too.",
"But the sad truth of the matter is that a new finding in science requires as much backing as a new project in high finance or social climbing.",
"At one time they present the phenomena of the one, at another of the other.",
"On the chemical side, an explanation for these nervous phenomena has been advanced.",
"Behind the body, and behind the mind is this board of governors.",
"The phenomena of varieties in species are thus explained.",
"Ring a bell before offering the meat.",
"And we have just been laying a plan to capture him.",
"All were delighted with the place.",
"I know that this will be a very shocking proposal to all our able specialists in foreign policy.",
"He would have no reason for believing anything of the sort.",
"He is not an evil figure, he is not a strong figure, but he has that sort of weakness, that failure in decision, which trails revolution in its wake.",
"Will nobody answer this bell?",
"He just stood there staring and I could see by his neck that he was breathing hard and all nervous sort of.",
"Then all of a sudden I knew why he climbed up there.",
"It was flowing easy then.",
"Now that she could drive the car and get away from her kitchen sink at will, she seemed another woman.",
"She had not realized how high she had climbed.",
"He appeared to be a stranger to every body present.",
"And, as he is equally a stranger to our readers, we will now announce him in proper form.",
"She was addressed no longer upon a topic, of which she wished never to hear.",
"Permission was granted to borrow a dress coat.",
"Do we not owe some duty to our country in this matter?",
"Her cousin had been so pleasant and so entertaining that she wished to keep her always.",
"He hates us.",
"They had no time for words, but only laughter.",
"We made them strangers in their own land.",
"Both were strangers to me.",
"A stranger passing through the room would not have noticed her beside the other.",
"I fancy how he watches the mail.",
"He did not much fancy having a stranger.",
"He wished she might be near, so that he could go and see her.",
"He may cross to far lands beyond the sea.",
"There is no reason, therefore, against simply believing the story as it stands.",
"But they were nothing compared with the laughter of the girl.",
"Then he waited for the laughter.",
"There was laughter again.",
"The truth rushed over the brain of the big man.",
"But, when the big key was fitted into the lock and the lock turned, he showed his first signs of interest.",
"He must put an end to any increase of the obligations.",
"From where he stood he could see all that he wished.",
"It was at once apparent that the man had neither knowledge of nor concern with the stranger.",
"Or he had been given every excuse for believing that such was the case.",
"They planted the seeds in even rows.",
"He saw a little garden all planted in even rows.",
"He wished to show her that his opinions were the same.",
"Then, as her little sisters embarrassed her, she wished to get rid of them.",
"But then his wife had lived in those rooms, and he wished to remain in them.",
"But she seemed to have lost her head and to have forgotten where she wished to go.",
"Then he wished to set his pipe between his lips once more, but was unable to do so.",
"He is not the stranger.",
"All peoples admire themselves.",
"It is a pretty, pleasant, domestic interior, charming and grateful to the senses.",
"Come, let us march!",
"We weigh them not!",
"I am easily persuaded, boy.",
"Stay, here are strangers.",
"The blood rushed to my face.",
"There was no doubt about his color, or that he was all over of about the same shade of black.",
"Sink it again.",
"That he was so persuaded permits of no doubt.",
"He went from city to city, delivering speeches and laying his platform before the people.",
"When challenged by native guards, they replied with shots.",
"We started immediately, but this march was to be short.",
"Their chase ended with a wild fight among themselves.",
"In all times they have been tied down to roads and bridges.",
"Soldiers sang it out to one another on the march.",
"The army was on the march.",
"They gave chase.",
"At last, when his horses were mounting a hill, he turned round.",
"The mind seeks but the heart finds.",
"All my senses are very highly developed.",
"Probably there were also some paragraphs.",
"Most of these dealt with problems people faced while gardening at home.",
"Once they were able to fly again they could fly out if they wished.",
"I recall that on my second day, I had entered a bus and rushed for an empty seat.",
"It does not grow wings at any stage of its life.",
"Of course I was delighted and accepted the offer.",
"Have our troops any other employment than to march to a review?",
"But let us suppose, that their own safety had some influence on their conduct, they will not, however, sink to a level with their enemies.",
"And every subsequent contract must be understood in a sense consistent with former obligations.",
"Did they not even refuse to march?",
"Such an opinion ought to weigh with all.",
"We continued our march over nearly the same sort of country, but all was now flat as far as the eye could see, the hills being left behind us.",
"He found out that it was a bad one, and therefore wished to buy up all the copies, and burn them.",
"I am afraid I must once more owe my recovery to warm weather, which seems to make no advances towards us.",
"There is one side on which a good man might be persuaded to embrace it.",
"We now know a method of mounting into the air, and, I think, are not likely to know more.",
"I am delighted by finding that our opinions are the same.",
"To a learned friend I owe the following note.",
"The girls, it was said, had not wished to marry.",
"I was persuaded to learn more of it.",
"I climbed the brief flight of stairs.",
"Silence followed the last words, while the friendly moon climbed up the sky.",
"Roads have been made and bridges built.",
"The stranger moved slowly past.",
"After a short pause, the guards were ordered to retire with their prisoner.",
"The door again opened, and the military stranger was admitted to their presence.",
"The chase lost its charm for him the moment the game was seen.",
"They all rushed to lift him up.",
"Sweet stranger!",
"In my opinion, cow protection societies may be considered cow killing societies.",
"So I generally managed, before the time arrived when it was actually necessary for me to do so, to turn my property, as far as possible, into money, and establish myself in some other place as a stranger.",
"Of course I had to learn the languages of the countries I visited, and as I was always a student, it delighted me to do so.",
"I visited his court because I greatly wished to know a man who knew so much.",
"On the way we met the stranger again, and this time he stopped and asked us some questions about the country and the neighborhood.",
"He told me he considered himself under the greatest obligations to me for what I had done for him, and as he spoke I could see that a hope was growing within him that perhaps I might do something more.",
"She had perceived that I was a stranger, and she wanted to know where I came from, what was my business, and as much as I could tell her of myself.",
"They were delighted with both these institutions.",
"The company were all satisfied, and wished to come again.",
"They wished me to conduct it in our own way.",
"This impression was so strong that he felt as if it would be murder to leave the spot without making a more minute search, and he ordered the boat to be lowered at once.",
"That she was in full chase, there could not be a doubt.",
"Winners held his hands before it, from habit.",
"Job was delighted.",
"Winners wanted to speak with him.",
"Winners, there is no occasion.",
"It was perfectly apparent that he meant to enjoy the trip, that he was prepared to like his fellow passengers and that he wished them to know it.",
"Already other images and ideas were flowing into his brain.",
"Yet her coming brought only confusion to his senses.",
"She could ring up if she wished.",
"When he came to, he was lying with his finger pressed against the electric bell.",
"As to my future intentions, well, I am not quite sure about them.",
"He, too, was staring at me.",
"The shade invited us to sit down.",
"Some sink.",
"And so, after many years, father and son met as strangers.",
"What may have gone on in the chambers above and around me I know not!",
"The sound of the laughter broke the spell.",
"Strange thoughts rushed through her mind.",
"What wings have I?",
"I was in the hands of strangers whom my mother did not fully trust.",
"Hardly had I climbed the second hill when I heard sounds coming after me.",
"The horrible scene about me seemed a trick of my senses, for I could not understand it was real.",
"He sent his message on the wings of fire and he believed she would get it.",
"What was, what could be, the meaning of the shocking scene she had then been forced to witness?",
"He will be delighted.",
"Are the tops of all those things real silver?",
"I could not have let it pass to strangers.",
"But the poor mother rushed out of the house crying for her child.",
"They opened the glass door and rushed into the gallery.",
"Besides, the distance was short, and there was no need to cross any bridges.",
"This great hall was on a level with the landing.",
"They expected chambers and beds.",
"They who alone were not threatened insisted on believing that they were in danger.",
"Almost at the same moment the bell of the street door sounded.",
"If all do not march, some will march.",
"To march the first, to march at the head, such was their duty.",
"It seemed as if the man offered his services to any one who wished to fly.",
"We are guessing at everything.",
"He wished to continue and to urge me.",
"The column continued its march.",
"It had been raining, and all the holes were pools of water.",
"I should have wished to stop there.",
"The stranger had made no effort as yet to rise, and the child who sat at his side with her head on his knee still slept.",
"I know not how this stranger moves my mind.",
"He had tried to borrow what he needed, and failed.",
"Daily he looked among strangers for work.",
"In the moment when he first saw her now he knew he had found the world again, that he was no longer a stranger in it, that he was living in it and a part of it.",
"He is not a student of such phenomena.",
"His eyes are staring, as if they must see what those about him cannot see, and his breath comes quickly.",
"There was a strong pull at his bell.",
"He wished it were a mile to land.",
"He was one of the winners in the game of life who did not die early.",
"I had a great many compensation cases, where houses, lands, and businesses had been taken for public or company purposes.",
"He wished to be taken to the hospital where she was.",
"The stranger seemed to know me, and I had a little further conversation with him.",
"So it was, if I wished to be ill.",
"To borrow that sum would have been easy, but to pay it back would have been difficult.",
"I took to gardening.",
"I think I never knew how much I valued it until I was shut out from it.",
"The situation rather delighted him than otherwise.",
"At a glance he saw that the stranger did not belong to the show.",
"The people here are delighted.",
"He heard a bell ring out.",
"Merely because he was ill and wished to rest?",
"One was allowed, she told me, to take out as many books as one wished, and to keep them until one had finished reading them.",
"How he wished he might!",
"A bell struck the hour.",
"The children and the sound of their laughter gave the camp a domestic touch.",
"It is fortunate that desire and opportunity do not always march together.",
"He hates himself because of it.",
"No use worrying.",
"As for me, I should have been delighted to set fire to the whole lot.",
"The key fitted.",
"But he was not looking on, and even if he had been I could not have done what I wished.",
"I stood as if I were turned to stone, and I only wished that I might be, for a stone knows no pain.",
"My blood rushed up to my head.",
"I allowed myself to be persuaded.",
"My power comes from the negative uses of the senses.",
"Everyone turned to look, and saw the stranger.",
"And we were both delighted to see one another.",
"Their slaves did all the worrying.",
"He has no property worth mentioning.",
"He lowered his voice.",
"Then he lowered his voice.",
"We see no marks of design in physical phenomena.",
"She did not seem in any wise upset, nor, save for that nervous laughter, did she show her excitement.",
"But she did not know what she wished.",
"She stood staring after him.",
"He stood staring out the window.",
"Surely nobody in their senses can bear this.",
"At break of day the guards informed him that they had seen a vessel a good distance from land.",
"There was no sailing between the trees, which were close together, nor did we know how to get back.",
"I rushed into the city, at full speed, got some letters and a morning paper, and, returning as rapidly as possible, gave them to her.",
"I told him that I had been sailing during the summer, but that the boat was now laid up, and that I was anxious for another job.",
"But only those of rare size, shape or color are now valued at high prices.",
"But I owe a duty to my firm.",
"Still her heart did not fail her, or her hopes altogether sink.",
"Not that she ever wished to see it again.",
"Now the question was, where the little stranger was to go, whom she had kept with her up till now.",
"It constitutes the power of the human soul.",
"It is time to ring the bell.",
"If his guest wished conversation it was apparent that he must set it going himself.",
"Let it sink in.",
"She was delighted to see me.",
"Lying back in the shade, in her white dress she looked very much at her ease.",
"And I read quite shocking things in it.",
"With a start he saw, what he had missed before, that this woman, his wife, was a stranger.",
"She had never wished to do wrong, but when she had done it, it had never seemed so very wrong to her.",
"All this was very wrong, shocking even, especially in church.",
"She hates it so.",
"The jury burst into laughter.",
"Something warm rushed to his heart at the sight of her.",
"And the jury, believing, understood.",
"No replies came.",
"Then lowered them to the level of his lips, holding them suspended, eyes looking into hers, waiting.",
"Chambers does it most successfully.",
"Chambers puts into his work.",
"He sat down at the table, laying his hand on the watch.",
"He turned its leaves over until he came to a few loose prints.",
"The chief turned to leave the room, saying quietly that that was all he wished.",
"In the afternoon we struck snow, and had considerable difficulty in breaking our own trails.",
"We now rushed up to close quarters.",
"Instead of following the trail by which we had come, we decided to push straight across country, hoping in this way to reach our main camp in one march.",
"Off he rushed into the woods with the dog after him.",
"A similar change takes place in the bell.",
"Give me nerve and fire and breed.",
"They would not have a stranger.",
"The moon had gone in again, and it was raining heavily.",
"And yet he could not submit to be beaten by this stranger without a struggle.",
"It was just quietly growing potatoes.",
"Look out for the cars while the bell rings!",
"The more he thought on this subject, the wider grew his intentions concerning the child.",
"But I heard a child crying by a broken window, just where the middle car had struck across the rear one, and I climbed up there at the risk of my life and looked in.",
"He was out beyond the city limits now, climbing the long hill toward home.",
"Most of the chambers in this part of the mine had been worked out and abandoned.",
"He even wished that the joy of this new knowledge had not come to him.",
"He climbed slowly up over the fallen rock and coal and let himself down upon the other side.",
"But it took his breath away, this climbing, and he had to wait there a little while to recover it.",
"He had not much thought, now, which way he went, he cared little for direction, he wished only to keep in motion.",
"He thought the boy might have turned into that, and he passed up through it and so into the chambers.",
"His answer to that part of my letter was quite as I could have wished.",
"I however continued to ride by him, finding he wished I should do so.",
"I wished much to have a picture of him just as he was.",
"There is great plenty of potatoes here.",
"After breakfast we surveyed the castle, and the garden.",
"It were to be wished, that a mode for its being otherwise were found out.",
"He thought, however, the castle too low, and wished it had been a story higher.",
"There was some difficulty in climbing to a near view.",
"Fat serves as a soft packing material.",
"Let it cool and weigh again.",
"Now it will be found that a continuous stream flows from the tube.",
"This clustered arrangement is called a nerve center.",
"The sight is well regarded as the highest and the most perfect of all our senses.",
"The selection of suitable glasses calls for great care, as much harm may be done by using glasses not properly fitted to the eye.",
"They help to protect the eyes from dust, and to a certain extent to shade them.",
"She wished to go alone.",
"He wrote to his family, who were delighted at the news.",
"He wished to give him flowers.",
"The bell began to ring for meeting.",
"He is making experiments on a narrow border of his wild lands.",
"Bridges crowded with men gave way under him.",
"She did not know what to reply and wished to run away.",
"His body was green, his head blue, the tips of his wings were pink and his breast was golden.",
"She rushed to the place.",
"The places occupied by the pictures formed yellow squares on the walls.",
"The crowds met in great excitement and laughter.",
"So then the king gave a great ball, to bring all the chief men of the country together to try would the shoe fit any of them.",
"And they tried the shoe and it fitted him, and his hair matched to the piece that had been cut off.",
"As it was getting late in the day, I left the party to form a camp, while I climbed the hills to get a view of the country in advance.",
"Her farther intentions.",
"He therefore sends for me directly, with these shocking words, that I will come and close his eyes.",
"They might be hiding high, having wings.",
"They were running games, climbing games, hiding games, jumping games.",
"The children wished she had stayed.",
"The bird began to beat its wings and breast against the bars.",
"She was almost as delighted with that as with the cake.",
"But how the children wished their mother were waiting for them in the little house to hear the tale!",
"He was standing on the shore, looking away and away, almost to foreign lands.",
"But he wanted, too, to go on and across the sea and into foreign lands.",
"She wished she had never had any children to grow up and suffer what she had.",
"And she told me that often her dress was one cake of ice up to her knees, the snow and rain being frozen on her skirts.",
"The warning bell had broken in on their talk, as it had on that of the rival girls.",
"The others walked on, the boys joining in the talk and laughter.",
"I stepped on a piece of glass, and it went right through my shoe.",
"My money has given me commercial position, but no social one worth mentioning.",
"But when I got into the stable I wished I had waited outside.",
"She climbed a high tower, and prepared to throw herself down, and die.",
"Now he turned round again, and with a gentle movement indicated that he wished her to leave the room.",
"A chase had been arranged for the morning.",
"Often enough he would borrow some of this money even.",
"With this he sat in his box, he surveyed the scene around him.",
"She rushed into the bedroom, and closed the door.",
"He rushed out of the door, resolved to find what had become of her.",
"Sons and daughters embraced their fathers.",
"The stranger turned and left them.",
"The stranger sat.",
"It was apparent that the stranger did not recognize him.",
"But she feels almost precisely the same way when she hates one who has.",
"His eyes were wide, staring.",
"After all, there are things in private letters which one does not wish a stranger, and a police officer, to read.",
"They clustered in a group by the door.",
"He raised his right hand, and the chairman, who was watching him, pressed an electric bell.",
"I wished, as I looked at the case, that he could have seen it.",
"Some newspaper men came to me for information, but I sent them packing.",
"Like others of his school, he sought a physical ground for all phenomena.",
"He maintained the uncertainty of knowledge, meaning the knowledge derived through the senses.",
"They drew conclusions as to the origin of the universe from material phenomena.",
"He taught the world how to weigh evidence.",
"He wished to die.",
"A gallery of the horse shoe pattern runs round the greater portion of it.",
"Rows of small forms run down each side.",
"Opinions of medical societies.",
"Extent to which the senses can be improved.",
"Children in factories.",
"Improving the senses.",
"He had now entered the skirts of the village.",
"He would borrow the rest.",
"That brought him to his senses.",
"But we believing it to be otherwise, surely, we ought to be more concerned for the reputation and success of the one than of the other.",
"When sailing along, I approached my own country.",

"We might get pitched over any minute.",
"It is just possible it was pitched somewhat higher than usual that morning.",
"We protest and withdraw, washing our hands of the whole business for the moment.",

"If he see fit to destroy man out of the earth, he will destroy none but those who deserve and need destroying.",
"Blessed is he, and blessed are his children after him.",
"Merely for the pleasure of destroying?",
"Are we only to be blessed in the next?",
"What an ally either of them would be!",
"A stain had come away from the rock.",
"It was impossible for him to remain seated a long time.",
"The blow shook him to the center.",
"He dare not trust his men, even himself, with his black thoughts.",
"What is there that they may not do, and dare not do?",
"He said no more, but shook his own.",
"Through the window, which had remained open, all the sounds of the lovely spring night poured into the room.",
"At this same moment there came another ring at the door, announcing another visitor.",

"She smiled with some confusion.",
"And the sisters did not dare to pursue him down the stairs.",
"Then he again smiled, and acknowledged that he had done wrong in passing so near to the wheels.",
"But most of us dare not take this ground.",
"It is necessary in order that we may save children dangers of which they know nothing.",
"Why, who comes here, with whom I dare not fight?",
"Bear witness, he threatens me!",
"Shall we part stakes?",
"They were framed for another age, which nobody now living remembers, which is, indeed, so remote from our life that it would be difficult for many of us to understand it if it were described to us.",
"And on the other side of the wall, he smiled slowly to himself.",
"And he led the way up a winding path.",
"But the true story of the black stain is in reality quite otherwise.",
"She turned, and with a smile and gesture invited him to be seated.",
"This was resisted.",
"Such a law, they say, generates a spirit of freedom.",
"Boys who know no more of human form, than they do of the eyes, nose, and mouth in the moon, begin painting portraits.",
"I do not like their principles, I do not like their manners, I do not like their opinions.",
"At his house we discussed the location of the tank, lighting arrangements, the water filters, the kind and quantity of fish he would like to have, and maintenance.",
"However, I met with no other innovations, and, therefore, was willing to hope, that he found something right at home.",
"It is the consequences, therefore, of all human actions that must stamp their value.",
"Or what dangers are feared?",
"Are we sure of one positive active ally in the world?",
"People draw water daily from this well, but no one dare look down it.",
"When will people learn to be united, so that by union they may win their freedom and independence?",
"Any thing new or remarkable in the house, or household furniture, must be noticed or admired.",
"The manners of the people are pure.",
"He embraced me, and gave me his blessing, as usual when I was leaving him for any length of time.",
"She recovered herself quickly, and the girl in her smiled upon me again.",
"And she smiled.",
"If she at last appeared to suspect that she must effect a compromise, I dare say she was as nearly correct as I could have put her with any words I knew.",
"But at last I could hear her breathe and could see the increasing rise and fall of it, so that I feared a crisis.",
"West smiled.",
"The girl smiled at him.",
"The blind woman shook her head.",
"Then he shook his head.",
"She looked all right, and laughed when I told her about being a bore, and I thought she liked it.",
"By himself stood an officer in a uniform differing from all around him.",

"The words gained a new and blessed meaning in his eyes.",
"The stranger smiled.",
"I have admired them.",
"The capacity of the nation for suffering regulates its advance towards freedom.",

"Her husband smiled.",
"Her husband shook his head.",
"We soon became united to him in spirit.",
"In accompanying them home, some of them expressed to me that it had been a blessed and happy day, they hoped never to be forgotten.",
"When the circle was seated, we formed a pretty large company.",
"Blessed be his name!",
"He smiled and made a sign for it to be placed under his head.",
"She smiled at him as one might smile at a boy.",
"He turned back to his desk and seated himself.",

"His voice shook with passion.",
"His lips shook as he tried to speak.",
"We shook hands, and she led the way to her own room.",
"We never drank it except upon great occasions.",
"Our guest smiled.",
"They drank a plenty of the water.",
"She was very pretty, but her manners were neither of the town nor of the country.",
"The old man smiled.",
"Then they shook hands.",
"He may have been one of those men who like to wander around at night.",
"Or, rather, let them answer if they dare.",
"The religious song of the country, I say again, is a growth, rooted deep in all its story.",
"I admired my cousin greatly.",
"The crowd were seated about it on the grass in a great circle.",
"There our party were united again.",
"But when I turned my head, I saw that I was the only one seated, and all the rest at our table remained standing.",
"At their bases a broad gray road was winding itself round about them until it came by the station.",
"I smiled while my eyes were still fixed upon the bright fire, but I said nothing in reply.",
"A stamp was carefully placed on the envelope.",
"His thin frame shook with emotion.",
"They come and pass, and leave no stain behind.",
"This example illustrates well the general character of what she contributed to my writings.",
"The other man shook his head, and laughed.",
"She shook her head and smiled.",

"The old man shook his head.",
"The nurse smiled.",
"The sister shook her head.",
"I have blessed him, and he shall be blessed.",
"And he blessed him in the same place.",
"And he blessed the king and went out.",
"And so he treats it in a religious way.",
"He never stepped aside from his own path, yet would always reach a blessing to his neighbor.",
"I dare say!",
"A few ladies succeeded in making their way to their husbands.",
"I arose from the chair where I had seated myself.",
"Then a violent blow which we interpreted as a warning shook our wooden wall.",
"It already has one stain.",
"The accusing document was short.",
"Each has his secret aims.",
"United with this, the nurse should rise early, and also be regularly employed during the day in some little portion of duty in the family, an attendance upon the wants of the child not being alone sufficient.",
"The wind grew more violent, and a heavy sea, raised by its force, united to add to the dangers of the situation.",
"She smiled next day, and before the week was past she was quite gay.",
"Price, kissing her daughter.",
"He never smiled on the boy nor gave him one encouraging word.",
"A second report, more heavy than the first, shook the air.",
"The house was soon surrounded by the enemy, and shots poured in from all directions.",
"He shook his head, looked so sad, and turned away with such a deep drawn sigh, that she could not bear to ask him more.",
"Nothing is hard to them that dare to die.",
"I dare not.",
"The counsel shook his head and would have smiled, I could see that, only he was disappointed.",
"Let him look in my face, if he dare, if he can!",
"As to the financial side of the question, I smiled.",
"Yet even that black stain became in time a part of us.",
"This is the blessing with a double if.",
"He explained, with a great many excited gestures.",

"Her mother, who was listening, smiled slowly.",
"She smiled at him.",
"But she only shook a finger.",
"Once or twice he shook his head.",
"Had she made a friend of him, an ally?",
"This in time bore further round in the same direction and suddenly ended at the entrance to a field.",
"It is certain that he could have had no vision of the empire soon to be built out of the desert by himself and men of his stamp.",
"The other man was of a different stamp.",
"She did not quite accept it, yet it fascinated.",
"The disasters that might have fallen upon her crowded his mind.",
"A storm would wipe out the tracks they had made.",
"He had been rescued in time to save him from any permanent ill effects.",
"And he was a man who paid his debts.",
"Once, when he had pressed his mother with questions, she had smiled deeply and changed the subject.",
"Who the rest of the party were or what relation they bore to him, the guests did not learn.",
"His knees shook.",
"We knew, of course, that the enemy would sweep other channels for his ships, but as soon as we discovered the position of these channels, which was not a very difficult matter, more mines were laid at the end.",
"So that it will be seen that the mines were laid as fast as delivery was made.",
"This was also approved and measures were taken to provide the necessary mines.",
"It is very possible, on the other hand, that in the case of mines the results were good.",

"Change of manners.",
"Family portraits.",
"We talked of change of manners.",

"The girl shook her head without looking at him.",
"They filled and drank, filled and drank.",
"Which last was stretching it rather.",

"His heated blood was cooling fast.",
"Her eyes were bright with conflicting emotions.",
"I resolved to be rid of it and cast about for some means of destroying it.",
"But although his writings were learned, his style was so bad that the ages have failed to preserve him.",
"From this point of view alone we see the blessing and the promise which were given to him.",
"Has dramatic poetry ever created such a display of conflicting emotions?",
"Singing men and women celebrated his victories.",
"People may believe what they like, so far as we are concerned, if they behave themselves, and pay their debts.",
"Men of this stamp would be much appreciated at present.",
"It is on this account, more perhaps than any other, that I value it more highly than all other fruits united.",

"The road is a little back from the shore and it is anything but straight, winding in and out in the effort to keep near the coast.",
"I breathe again!",
"What thoughts conflicting then were shared.",
"He seated himself beside her without speaking.",
"His blessing, indeed!",
"These men and women, with the historic names, dare not show each other what they are.",
"Husbands devoted themselves to wives whom they never saw but in public.",
"He bore it because he could not help it.",
"The count, who is seated at a table near the window, rises.",

"Her sister smiled, and held her in her arms.",
"She smiled again.",
"This the people resisted.",
"She again shook her head.",
"She shook her head again.",
"These were not my exact words, but that was the sense of them, as nearly as my sudden and conflicting emotions permitted me to express it.",
"Not for his life dare he show it.",
"It was fairly difficult to catch the land playing these tricks.",
"In the afternoon a big one bore down upon us.",
"They have been admired many a time since.",
"How it blew and poured!",
"He even smiled, and almost might it appear that he had enjoyed the beating.",
"The band were seated opposite us.",
"The old woman down there is always accusing me of turning up my nose at her food.",
"I shook off everything to right and left.",
"I do not understand what they are as formal sciences.",
"Of course, too, if talk is more innocent in this country, manners are so, to begin with.",
"An ordinary man would say that he had been waiting till he could pay his debts.",
"I dare not wonder.",
"How I admired him!",
"I dare say I am.",
"Suffer me to wander without purpose.",
"Too soon for me, I dare to say.",
"The picture shall be framed and hung up in my study.",
"Another portion of my money is the money which I have received for my writings, for my books.",

"He deserved freedom on account of the energy with which he struggled for it.",
"Let get very hot and pour over the fish.",
"Pour all together and let cook until meat is very tender.",
"I seemed suddenly to become possessed of a new sense.",
"Of course such streams are but little affected by the weather.",
"Besides, it encourages the minister.",
"He dragged me all over the floor.",

"Gentle reader, hurry me not.",
"So all night long the poor man planned and calculated, and in the morning, with heavy heart, proceeded to put his plans into effect.",
"And now he wanted something in a hurry, and was very much afraid he would never get it.",
"Suppose she was forgetting him entirely?",
"He deserved it.",
"She had admitted by her behaviour on the night he returned that she cared for him, and, for the moment, that was enough.",
"In order to take care of them and have enough food for them, she ate only the simplest of foods, sometimes nothing but rice for a long time.",
"He was stretched out on a dirty bed.",
"I dragged him down twice and called out for help.",
"At home he was ever ready to lend a hand at house work to save his mother.",
"His fortune was thus early made, and his business life was one continued series of successes.",
"The same smells of the same foods.",
"A crowd of people we can be proud to entertain.",
"It is usually possessed by those who live in the country, and according to nature, as it is called, and who take much and varied exercise.",
"According to the usual custom, no masters were present.",
"It was a horrible idea to entertain, although the act would have been almost justified.",
"And one which called for prompt action.",
"However wrong my conduct was I had been driven to it and my father, for whom I was sorry, by taking part against me, deserved to lose me.",
"The next day we rolled out of camp, and proceeded on our way towards the setting sun.",
"Seeing that he possessed rare running qualities, I determined if possible to get possession of the animal in some way.",
"With the increase of his judgment the light which should make it apparent has faded away.",
"When she reached it she stopped and looked with keen delight at the beautiful creatures in the fields on either side.",
"I only wish I deserved it.",
"My taste is art and I correct exercises.",
"The bones have been dragged up on to some rocks.",
"God bless him!",
"He was dragged out.",
"Beyond any question, after a while something goes wrong with the nerves.",
"But after arriving there, they were a little delayed for lack of what they called tackle.",
"They sent a man off for it, and then sent another to hurry up the man.",
"No, she that is mine, I will teach to entertain at another rate.",
"Bless me!",
"One of the most beautiful evenings I ever saw.",
"I dare say I have deserved it.",
"Another helpful grouping is the more objective one.",
"In this reach no streams of any importance enter.",
"But none possessed it.",
"He seemed to have been disturbed in reading, for he carried in his hand a little book with a finger marking his place.",
"I spent all my evenings, when at home, in making a map of the country.",
"My broken nerves would not suffer me to lie hidden.",
"She had folded down the paper, so that neither saw what it was.",
"She made up her mind in a hurry, without thinking.",
"It happened to them suddenly to perceive in their way a man returning home.",
"The sun was rising in the sky, which was keen and clear with the pleasure of the morning.",
"And the man looked round on all he had, and all he had achieved, and everything which he possessed, to enjoy it.",
"And I proceeded on my way.",
"Then the other locked the door, and we proceeded on our way.",
"I have served in the troops of those who are masters there.",
"From that moment I tried to shelter him, and as I grew stronger and stronger and pushed my way to the door, I dragged him along with me.",
"I went up to one of those who seemed the masters of ceremony, directing what was going on.",
"The waste stretched far as eyes could see.",
"They were made of steel and iron, but they moved like the brains and nerves of men.",
"But this did not affect our pleasure in it so much as I have known it to affect other streams.",
"God bless the boy!",
"This the old man got out in a great hurry, as if afraid that his master would stop him.",
"What struggles he had gone through before I cannot tell.",
"The streams are dry.",
"Further, there is no need to hurry.",
"Now, we must hurry.",
"She forgot to criticize.",
"But hurry.",
"Masters saw fit to fall back on the last remark.",
"The thought rushed red across his brain and then faded slowly.",
"I thought the house was on fire, and I come down in a hurry.",
"This business was getting on my nerves again.",
"He possessed a power over me.",
"And what nerves of steel this man possessed!",
"So the lesson proceeded.",
"The baby notices.",
"Their long tails were wound round their bodies, and over their heads, and down between their legs.",
"The good man was in such a hurry that he forgot to get a pass.",
"All the streams were full of water.",
"Then he would hurry back and get into the window again.",
"Nobody would lend him any more money.",
"When they got to the seal, they dragged it farther away from the water.",
"He was some anxious to get to the eats.",
"It was obvious that something had disturbed her.",
"She lowered her eyes and her color faded.",
"Her color was high but her look indicated keen relief.",
"All the same, the girl was keen and interested.",
"The strange thing is, when I left my job before I was keen to get back.",
"But she must not think him disturbed.",
"The old fellow was very keen.",
"On the bridge, however, the air was keen and sweet, and he felt the contrast.",
"She wondered with keen anxiety whether the man had seen her.",
"Although she smiled, her glance was keen and not friendly.",
"The moon was bright, but the shadow of the hotel stretched across the garden.",
"The old man dragged himself out.",
"Something possessed the girl, other than her common self.",
"They were interesting at the time but not worth repeating now.",
"Where shall we put their coats and picture hats, how shall we cover up their hair, what shall we feed them with?",
"The woman teacher, and quite truly, insists that she works as hard and as long hours as the man in her grade of service, and on that sound foundation she builds her just demand for equal pay.",
"And in this manner they proceeded for perhaps another half hour.",
"The weapon spun into the sea.",
"They left their uniforms in the room where they had changed.",
"In fact, I am in no hurry to form one.",
"He described the position of the room in which the body was found, and the attitude in which the body was stretched.",
"It had dragged his past into the light of day, and he stood before them a ruined man.",
"But the chief is not very keen on the case.",
"I got him at the head of the stairs and dragged him back into the room and shut the door and stood with my back against it.",
"Nevertheless I proceeded to enter and close the door carefully behind me.",
"Not a sound disturbed the great, empty building.",
"A possibility which had risen in my mind faded at these words.",
"But his eye was as keen as ever, and he began to use that eye from the moment he passed the gates.",
"Meanwhile, the examination proceeded.",
"I shall give orders not to be disturbed.",
"He heard his master cough.",
"There was a strange hurry and excitement around him, and the girl paid less attention to him.",
"With an effort he dragged himself to his feet, but fell back into the snow again.",
"And then the vision faded away, and was followed by deep night.",
"He did not perceive the trick, and died on the spot.",
"It proceeded until evening and stopped under a tree to pass the night there.",
"He dug out enough silver until he had a great quantity and he established himself in the country.",
"One day, he had gone to wash something, he stretched it on the sand to dry.",
"They kept silent, and then consulted with each other.",
"He remained stretched on the earth.",
"He stretched out his foot and his wing.",
"Finally he stretched out fully his feet and legs.",
"They proceeded until they came to a certain place.",
"They proceeded a long way, and arrived at the village of which the real father of the child was the chief.",
"It was not for me, however, to criticize, even in my own mind, anything of a military nature which might be on foot.",
"A very large number of people in that country would welcome it, as it would be the only hope of preserving the existing order of things.",
"I perceive now why he was so deeply concerned in what I had to tell him this morning.",
"I only wonder that it should not have proceeded much further.",
"Let us cope first with this danger.",
"On the way, as we speed over the rolling down country beyond the town, my eyes are keen to catch some of the new signs of the time.",
"The available men must be sorted out.",
"He was dug out with difficulty.",
"They seemed possessed.",
"Make no hurry.",
"Then feeling very tired, he stretched himself out on his back and began to wonder if what he had seen was nothing but a dream.",
"However, there are many books on both sides of the question which may be consulted.",
"In taking this decision they did not perceive the danger of death, into which they were going more than ever.",
"There was no need, he said, to hurry on.",
"We were disturbed a little during the morning by enemy planes dropping bombs on the town, but none fell very near us.",
"But I gradually discovered that they really possessed very little of what they first promised me, and that nothing was known for certain as to when further stores would arrive.",
"He folded the paper, and replaced it in his pocket.",
"In fact, it has set my nerves quite on edge.",
"It dragged me to my feet.",
"And we proceeded to the house together.",
"He was not disturbed in that way, however.",
"But there was no need to hurry.",
"He stretched a long arm over the table, and took the hat.",
"Hurry, please.",
"The beautiful mother vision had faded away after a while.",
"What pleasant evenings did we not have together.",
"They cannot therefore carry, besides, an army large enough to cope with such a population as ours.",
"But the man dragged him forward, and they both went rolling down the rocks together, and were killed.",

"As we rode along he delivered a scientific lecture, and he convinced me that he knew what he was talking about.",
"Command me, sir!",
"Yes, sir!",
"He believed in sleeping partnerships.",
"Stand still, sir!",
"Then he stopped a moment, and wiped his face.",
"Sun shining.",
"No, sir!",
"We were much impressed, sir, by the singing.",
"But the waking spirit followed him into his dreams.",
"No, sir, they would wait till they got to the next village.",
"They were sounding low water, but he never heard.",
"Man sings.",
"Sir, this is not the way to be at ease.",
"Mostly he wants to watch, and perhaps just to stir them up a little if they do not perform to his satisfaction.",
"This arm must be of considerable length, as it can be seen for a long distance, and its valley can be traced through the mountains much farther than the lake itself can be seen.",
"In a second I was on the top of him, shouting to the others to lend me a hand.",
"Then suddenly he raised a shining face.",
"I insist, sir.",
"There was no ill feeling in his proud soul, and he bore defeat as a gentleman should.",
"But by and by, as she came to full possession of her waking senses, it appeared to her that there was some change in the atmosphere, in the scene.",
"But every day as he rode out he saw at one door a child, a little fair boy, who sat on the steps, and sang his little song like a bird.",
"It was wrapped in darkness though the sun was shining, the windows closed as if they never would open more, and the people within turning their faces to the wall, covering their eyes that they might not see the light of day.",
"At this moment I found it inspire me.",
"In the gentleman is there indeed such variety of ability?",
"The snow rests on them both winter and summer.",
"Our army is weak, and needs the talents of a fit general.",
"Sir, this may not be!",
"Poor old gentleman!",
"There are surprises in the newspaper business, as our girl journalists were fast discovering.",
"The first assumption obviously rests entirely on negative evidence.",
"Not another word, sir.",
"He soon fell into a sound sleep, and when he woke there was noise of men laughing and shouting about him.",
"Bend low.",
"And the growing illnesses, too!",
"Yet no one could have guessed it by his conversation.",
"For a whole minute he did not stir.",
"Mysteries are usually simply explained.",
"The switch is in a little iron box on the wall just back of the stairs, sir.",
"I ought to have guessed as much from the cut of his hair.",
"That scene is so photographed upon my brain that I have only to close my eyes to see it again in every detail.",
"This he opened and read as he rode slowly away.",
"Who is this gentleman?",
"They turned to the barred door.",
"They left a few men to keep up the fires, and make a noise like digging.",
"There was the place where they had been digging.",
"White men had another way of lighting a fire when the sun was shining.",
"The men got on their horses, and rode after.",
"A cold bath is pretty nice of mornings.",
"These marriages are of a simple kind.",
"And to find a new word which expresses exactly what an old one expressed but approximately is a real acquisition in living.",
"He got badly bored, and it was a relief when one afternoon the gentleman he had met at the construction camp arrived with his daughter.",
"I could not stir it.",
"When the new recruit enters the army, he leaves all this care and protection behind, but finds no substitute, no compensation for his loss in his new position.",
"On all ordinary occasions he followed his master or others of the family, seeming to take a human delight in their company.",
"The doors for service now stand open, and it rests with the women themselves to say whether they will enter in!",
"It rests with women themselves as to whether they shall enter in.",
"Among other things there will be a boxing match.",
"Hang on, sir.",
"I had a wife and child, sir, and they had a hard struggle while I was in prison.",
"And then there was my poor wife and child, and this little business, sir.",
"Look at it, sir.",
"Their friendship continued after their marriages.",
"A stir had taken place in her brain, and her nurse wanted to take her back home.",
"He had at home some chickens and a dog.",
"Another day they again greeted each other in the market.",
"For my part, I find in nature every thing that can inspire the most constant resolution.",
"The year was like a child waking up from a sleep into which he had fallen crying.",
"I did not doubt it was my father, for few others ever rode our way.",
"She seemed to understand my thought, for she placed one of her hands in mine, and with the other wiped my tears away.",
"They arise, like all other wars, from the existence of a class within the nation which is not really in accord with the people of that nation, but is pursuing its own interests apart from theirs.",
"The former relied for the financing of its schemes on the support of the commercials.",
"The last of these victories I myself witnessed.",
"How pleasant to be greeted by some of the same officers!",
"The hottest opponents stood on the same platform.",
"Of such materials are literary judgments made!",
"The stars were no longer shining and the rain clouds had gathered.",
"He is apparently a gentleman.",
"I guessed as much.",
"Her sweet face, with those soft, brown eyes, so tender and intense, stood out ever before me, sleeping or waking.",
"Next day, seeing no birds, they suspected that they had passed between some islands on both hands, and had slipped through without seeing them, as they guessed that the many birds which they had seen might have been passing from one island to another.",
"Yes, sir.",
"I rode through town that afternoon, and it was not entirely because time hung heavily on my hands.",
"Give me time, sir, I have only been twice to sea.",
"I am a gentleman only by birth and breeding.",
"Indeed, there was none who looked more the gentleman.",
"I should have guessed why he changed it.",
"The events she had witnessed seemed also to please her.",
"I guessed it long ago.",
"Grant saw that she was recovering, though slowly.",
"Of her own accord she took to poetry and music.",
"No, sir.",
"Emotion prevented her from completing either sentence.",
"I met the little boy who rode before.",
"The girl laughs.",
"I will go back, sir, where I have some friends, and where I am somebody still.",
"Hers was, indeed, a spirit that might be broken, but never would bend.",
"I know what seeming exceptions there are to this rule, especially in these days.",
"But I say that they are only seeming exceptions.",
"Upon it is traced in white lines the figure of a man.",
"Wake up, sir!",
"Welcome, sir, now and always, to our little home.",
"A great surprise and pleasure, sir!",
"Tell me that, sir.",
"A laugh greeted the gesture.",
"I am determined she shall not leave us, sir.",
"This last failing them, the result may be easily guessed.",
"They were barred out, on account of being behind time.",
"Gradually these forms became more solid until he realized that indeed the plane was filled with passengers, many of which were historical figures in the modes of dress of their particular times in history.",
"Not only because the sun was shining, but because he felt good.",
"The visitor was told that she was unable to see him, as she was only just recovering from an illness.",
"The hottest season of the year had now arrived, and the situation of the prisoners was far more terrible than any words can describe.",
"Much of her time also was spent in visiting the poorer women of the city.",
"Believe me, sir, it is a beautiful creature.",
"They mounted their horses and rode away without looking back.",
"They mounted their horses and rode back the way they had come.",
"There is no simpler method of discovering a secret than to ignore its existence.",
"There was more back of it than they could have guessed.",
"Such a man, I considered, could not fail to be aware of the ordinary political modes of action.",
"Well, sir!",
"Well, sir, they was tired out.",
"He should know at least what he was costing her.",
"This is very useful for keeping articles hot, without altering their quantity or quality.",
"Great care must be taken not to stir the fruit roughly, as it should be preserved as whole as possible.",
"They must be well wiped before they are put on table.",
"Stir the contents from time to time, to keep the milk smooth and prevent it from burning.",
"All these parts should be dry, clean, and shining.",
"But the hour of waking was at hand.",
"The dear old gentleman could never realize that I was grown up to be a woman.",
"No effort of the kind has ever met with more than seeming success.",
"The children, who were growing up, also asked many favors from her, which she was ever ready to fulfill.",
"Let us get ready, for I do not want the gentleman to wait.",
"I am afraid the master is not troubling much about it.",
"The gentleman started slightly and looked up.",
"And, sir!",
"In a few minutes smoke was seen issuing from the windows of the hall and an alarm of fire was sounded.",
"Then he crashed and was injured, but is now recovering in a hospital.",
"He is not violent, but he never laughs.",
"At that moment a shell hit the bridge and wiped out the entire group.",
"He is a gentleman, and I can claim to be no more.",
"He made a motion to it as though to hunt it away, but it did not stir.",
"Take care, sir!",
"Never mind, sir!",
"The only time I ever see her smile was when I wiped her out.",
"But, sir, as for me I need no thanks.",
"Lead me, some light, to the place where my love rests from the chase alone!",
"Here shall I rest with my friends, by the stream of the sounding rock.",
"Rode, skin.",
"He intended not to fulfill one of their demands, well aware that they too would not take up with anything that he submitted.",
"Instead, they went about themselves and sent others in various directions, winning over such as were not yet in accord with them, and gathering money and soldiers.",
"His confidence was not restored until a fish of its own accord jumped out of the sea and fell at his feet.",
"Having by this excuse freed herself of his presence, she set to her task.",
"These were the celebrations on the first day.",
"The sight I now witnessed, no description could represent to one who had not seen the same.",
"But such was not the term which would have occurred to any one who witnessed the movement.",
"But she had not guessed his secret.",
"Her father appeared mounted on the white horse he always rode.",
"Not a breath of wind appeared to stir across those fields.",
"She was recovering.",
"Dark forms barred it now and then.",
"Recovering his balance, he broke into a run.",
"Her father spread wide his arm before her, so that she had to bend low to see.",
"She felt a burning stir within her.",
"It was about the middle of a clear morning, still cold, but the sun was shining.",
"We must stop the possibility of his issuing any.",
"If he lives he owes his life to us.",
"They need be here only long enough for us to distribute these arms among them, and for me to speak a word of instruction to them.",
"In due time they arrived at the city where this rich gentleman lived.",
"Well, sir, we ought to have moving pictures of what followed.",
"She appeared interested in the consideration, and when they rode on was silent, obviously turning the matter over and over in mind.",
"His second was that it might be some one else, and that there was no sense waking a tired man for nothing.",
"She freed herself, and while he let her go he stood watching her with the new look in his eyes.",
"All this time she did not stir.",
"When she came to his side and he did not stir, she sought to brush by him.",
"She dropped the stick and wiped her hands.",
"By now all those tracks are wiped out, what with wind and new snow.",
"He was gone several minutes, digging after it.",
"The sun was shining.",
"That was all until morning woke him shining on a white world.",
"There are plenty of happy marriages.",
"The doctor watched him as he disappeared around the bend.",
"I heard men shouting and running up and down, and I wondered what had happened.",
"While I sat by her, I noticed an old gentleman staring at us.",
"A very sweet faced old lady sitting near him answered the old gentleman.",
"Come here, sir.",
"There is nothing like farming, to my mind.",
"Her eyes were bright and shining, and she went from one to another with such a happy face.",
"The gentleman did not say a word, but pointed to the burning building.",
"Many people are moving into it, to educate their children.",
"She lifted her eyes, shining with tears, and dropped them again.",
"But they went into the house and barred it everywhere.",
"Still she did not stir.",
"She did not stir or speak.",
"An application of it to the mysteries of sex was the immediate occasion.",
"Surgery then enters upon the scene.",
"The ability to profit by experience, and to make more and more accurate judgments as one grows older implies at least a maximum efficiency of it.",
"No, sir, I hang on to that business through thick and thin.",
"Here the rest of us just go along in an average way, and nothing happens to anybody to stir the blood.",
"But after they had been on board an hour they had covered only the few miles of river, and found themselves well out into the sound, but with no seeming prospect of going any farther.",
"But its name just expresses it.",
"Let me suggest that in that last sentence he really expresses the opinion that it cannot.",
"All the birds make a stir!",
"What are the songs the mother sings?",
"All the while I was coming down I kept shouting and when I got to the shore, there were half a dozen boats to meet me.",
"Because I knew I was to blame for shouting that down to him like a fool.",
"None of them went around shouting.",
"I guessed he had the money still, because I knew he was called away in a hurry.",
"The principal passion of the old gentleman was the love of money.",
"I could not have thought that he could have looked like a gentleman.",
"Sir, if this be the lady, I will give her to him with my own hand.",
"An officer must be a gentleman as well.",
"Then he started up, his eyes shining with the light of a new resolve.",
"The memory of her weakness was lost in the shining memory of her power.",
"The evening peace, which lay on the fields and hills, had flooded even the village streets.",
"Bend, a moment over.",
"And we educate them and dress them so nice, and they do lovely things.",
"He was large and fine looking and a gentleman.",
"She moved slightly as a gentleman seated himself beside her.",
"Of one accord they turned back to the house.",
"He liked it, and so I dressed him down and left him pretty near shining.",
"The words came of their own accord into his throat.",
"And rode him without a bit!",
"Before he ended her eyes were shining.",
"A longer sleep, whose waking is not here!",
"She wiped her eyes.",
"Once there was a gentleman who wrote stories.",
"Just ask that gentleman if I speak the truth.",
"After long reflection, the old gentleman had gone off without selecting any nurse, but saying that he would return some other time.",
"She certainly was of little account, and, whatever might become of her, the world would be none the poorer by her death.",
"Perhaps, sir, no.",
"Well, sir, away.",
"How then, sir?",
"Why so, sir?",
"I will, sir.",
"Well, sir.",
"A little, sir.",
"I take my leave, sir.",
"Good sir, the same.",
"Why, sir, I cannot paint.",
"What, what, sir?",
"Faith, sir, like a poor man of service.",
"What is it, sir?",
"Am I to blame, sir?",
"I must not say so, sir.",
"A gentleman, my friend.",
"He is a gentleman of a good house.",
"How, sir?",
"So, sir.",
"Well, sir, well.",
"Should I not, sir?",
"Then, sir, that is she.",
"What, sir?",
"Why, sir?",
"Time sorts not now to know these mysteries.",
"I know the gentleman.",
"Little he guessed the truth.",
"This, in turn, enables the large manufacturer to turn out a good car at a moderate price.",
"The state, nowadays, enters the homes of the people and insists on having a voice in questions that individual men and women, acting together, taking counsel together, used to settle for themselves in their own way.",
"Already there was a stir among the people, for it was late and many had come from a distance.",
"She watched him bend the bars back again to their proper place.",
"They found the house closely barred.",
"On recovering his senses the first use he had made of them was to observe her every glance and silence.",
"The men were laughing and shouting to each other.",
"The fine lady, or fine gentleman, who show me their teeth, show me bones.",
"Among the passengers on this occasion we had a gentleman and his wife, who really appeared to suffer from the arrangement.",
"If he prove himself as capable of completing education, as he appears to be of beginning it, his institution will be a very valuable one.",
"How is the markets, sir?",
"Many farmers spoke about their experience in organic farming.",
"Here, another meeting of persons interested in organic farming was taking place.",
"And what reason, sir, can be assigned, why that which is criminal in one man, should be innocent in another?",
"Such was the scheme, sir, as I have been informed, of this great man, nor, perhaps, can any other be struck out by human abilities, where greater numbers are to be opposed by smaller.",
"But this inquiry, sir, will produce no great information, if those, whose conduct is examined, are allowed to select the evidence.",
"But these, in my opinion, sir, are questions, if not remote from the present affair, yet by no means essential to it.",
"I appeal to the gentleman, whether the instance which he mentioned was not of this kind.",
"Such questions as these, sir, may be asked, which the bill before us will enable no man to answer.",
"I did not, sir, attempt to repeat expressions, as ought not to be heard without reply.",
"But, sir, there is yet a stronger argument against the supply in money only.",
"Sir, is it not natural for every one of us to guard our vital parts, rather than our more remote members?",
"He was dismissed with great demonstrations of friendship.",
"During our tour, the mornings were generally cold.",
"Their principles are the same, though their modes of thinking are different.",
"In the afternoon and evening I felt myself light and easy, and began to plan schemes of life.",
"A gentleman arrived late.",
"He took the troubling bills again.",
"Tell him to buy some cows and pigs and chickens, and hire a man to look after them.",
"Good morning, sir.",
"The gentleman did walk in, and while he waited looked about him.",
"We must get the boy out of the way, sir.",
"And why is it, sir?",
"No, he could not stir.",
"Keep quiet, sir, and let them get off.",
"It seems to have been the last which her pen ever traced.",
"At last, a gentleman who had witnessed his frequent calls, suggested that he send his card.",
"She knew it and guessed the reason.",
"He greeted the major with his kind quiet smile.",
"She showed signs of recovering herself.",
"Take that gentleman and put him in the car.",
"The room was suddenly flooded with light.",
"He pulled up and greeted us.",
"Not a word, sir.",
"That gentleman became excited at once.",
"I say, sir, the man probably fell down and broke his neck.",
"Now, that other gentleman!",
"He looked down at her as she stood recovering her breath.",
"The old gentleman smiled.",
"In the street he turned to the old gentleman with a smile.",
"Not a sign of him, sir.",
"The party rode in silence.",
"Dead silence greeted this sudden announcement.",
"I now make the spelling and forms of the words as modern as I may, altering the text no further.",
"Let all his works praise him with one accord!",
"His modes are larger and more human, more near to the forms of primary thought.",
"Show me himself, himself, bright sir!",
"An age of mysteries!",
"It was a new way of solving the problem of my inner self.",
"She does not stir.",
"I fear he did not like it, for though I greeted him, he was silent.",
"Her right hand rests on a long knife in her belt.",
"They rode on, side by side, for a long time, without speaking.",
"The only actual revolution which has ever taken place in my modes of thinking, was already complete.",
"The masses could not stir yet.",
"The blood of the law is quickly wiped up.",
"They did not know that their generals had been arrested.",
"As I passed he greeted me.",
"They will not stir.",
"They were those which had barred my passage.",
"Few generals venture upon them.",
"They did not stir, they seemed to have become stone.",
"They distribute an equal system of law and justice to all without respect of persons.",
"All the while the flags were kept flying from the hills, in hopes of attracting some passing ship.",
"Here, sir, at hand.",
"I pray, sir, where?",
"Perhaps so, sir.",
"The increased intelligence calls into activity modes of motion of a higher order corresponding to itself.",
"After the man there emerges from the door a little girl with yellow hair.",
"Furthermore, he is a gentleman of education, not merely of the school and university, but of the field and wood.",
"She had her ideal, and he did not fulfill it.",
"Figures do not lie, sir!",
"She touched the old gentleman upon his weak point.",
"He could hardly be called a gentleman, even as times and terms went then.",
"Now, sir, what next?",
"One gentleman to another, indeed!",
"Now came the gentleman who never attended races, and devoted himself to business.",
"I may say nobody has ever guessed it.",
"I have heard many arguments against adopting children, but I have never heard a good one.",
"He shook the stake and tried to move it, but it had been driven or planted so deeply into the sand that he could not stir it.",
"Please listen, sir.",
"Aside from this, on account of the absence of many attractions advertised in the show bills, disappointed audiences were showing an ugly spirit.",
"We can only do according to our power, and the capacity, gifts and talents, that we have.",
"They rode, walked and explored.",
"Have I always looked after the sheep, sir?",
"Was I wounded, sir?",
"A hot color flooded her face with anger to the roots of the hair.",
"The feeling that flooded him was deeper than joy.",
"Not once during the night did they stir.",
"Neither of them quite believed that he was recovering his sight.",
"When forced to abandon this operation, in consequence of the military advance being held up by the weather, these guns were mounted in monitors.",
"I guessed by his look that he did understand.",
"Teachers are those who educate the people to appreciate the things they need.",
"The boys go of their own accord, carrying their own commitment papers.",
"She did not speak, or move, indeed, she was so very still that he needs must bend down to see her face.",
"Nor would such general criticism accord with the plan of this work.",
"But there are too many mysteries and not enough plain dealing.",
"It expresses an emotion.",
"How many a new material, how many an improved process in manufacture is possible, yet is passed over, for want of a little science.",
"Many were the comments on this boy of such wonderful talents.",
"While I was eating, the men whom I had met rode up.",
"The results of such a state of society are easily traced.",
"They understood these demonstrations of his deep content.",
"But no one sings it, and I may listen wherever I like, I hear only other things.",
"This time the gentleman was determined to go.",
"The gentleman looked at him still more directly.",
"Why this is so, no one knows, when we do know we shall hold the key to many mysteries.",
"She laughs.",
"If I took it out now it would stop shining immediately.",
"And it must be all red and bright when I die, like a shining star in the dark.",
"Killing chickens, perhaps, or chasing cats.",
"The whole situation rests upon that.",
"Something was troubling the minister.",
"The girl greeted him quietly.",
"She was always different after that, though I never guessed why.",
"Or had she merely guessed?",
"She had told her all about it, and like most mysteries, it had turned out to be very simple.",
"Not even the doctor guessed how great the strain of those past weeks had been.",
"He did not stir.",
"My dear sir!",
"There are lots of questions, problems, difficulties that want solving and answering before I come to any conclusion.",
"He might break, but he would not bend.",
"It is largely to this energy and this determination that he owes the good fortune that has usually attended his hunting trips.",
"There was one band well below the snow line, and toward this we rode.",
"Occasionally as the river had made some big bend we had been able to sight the mountains which were to be our shooting grounds.",
"Round by round his man was recovering his strength.",
"Drink, sir, and be happy!",
"Shoot at once, sir, if he raises his hand.",
"He seemed to understand how hard it was for boys like they were to bend all day above those moving streams of coal.",
"May I have it, sir?",
"Then there were several motions made by as many lawyers.",
"Some one was shouting, too.",
"We talked of memory, and its various modes.",
"I sent to inform him that a gentleman desired to see him.",
"Sir, what can a nation that has not letters tell of its original.",
"Sir, it is surprising how people will go to a distance for what they may have at home.",
"As we rode by, I looked at the house again.",
"It was truly the dinner of a country gentleman.",
"Unlike the senses of taste and smell we seem, by the sense of vision, to become aware of the existence of objects which are entirely apart from us, and which have no direct or material link connecting them with our bodies.",
"There was such a stir throughout the settlement as called forth an expression of wonder from a stranger.",
"How many mysteries of the universe are shut within my breast!",
"He freed nations.",
"I cannot think that what we saw was an imagination of the waking mind.",
"He has, however, the appearance and air of a gentleman.",
"Nor blame me for the use I make of my talents.",
"I would be the subject of her dreams, as well as of her waking thoughts.",
"But they all said with one accord that she would surely come back in her own time.",
"Sometimes it sings, though.",
"The little boy had had a face like a star, and great shining eyes.",
"She had not said so, but he had guessed it from her face when she told him.",
"Slowly that face grew calm and warm color flooded it.",
"He had accepted a call from a distant village, and must necessarily break up his farming establishment.",
"She heard a gentleman come in and recognized his voice, which she had heard before.",
"It appeared that he had brought back with him the gentleman with the kind face.",
"I am sure I can get no rest for their shouting and playing.",
"Good even, sir.",
"Eggs, sir, as he says.",
"Pray, sir.",
"No matter, sir?",
"I mean the gentleman.",
"Who, sir?",
"He was my soldier indeed, sir, until he lost his leg.",
"Here, sir.",
"No, sir, he cannot, nor he shall not do it.",
"What gentleman?",
"What, sir!",
"I, sir?",
"He rode straight to his cousin and told her the news.",
"If he used the telephone there would be a way of discovering the number he had asked for.",
"It is the world of the country gentleman and of the upper professional class.",
"That gentleman, however, soon presented himself in person.",
"For change, she makes a joke of this, and plays with it, and laughs at it.",
"He then went to his father and said he wanted to live like a gentleman, and not like a slave.",
"They took their weapons in their hands, and rode forth from the camp.",
"He laughs.",
"No, sir, he had no business doing that.",
"Wherever the old gentleman went, some one of his relations went with him.",
"For a space of time they rode the bottom of the draw.",
"They are recommended to him by their employers after careful testing and sounding.",
"I therefore greeted him without remark, and, as he sat down under the electric lights, examined him in detail.",
"If I have the threat of it at my back, so that it rests with me, and me alone, to put it into force, I shall not need to use it.",
"There is reason, however, to believe, that its manufacture existed here previous to that time.",
"They are curious, but they do not inspire us.",
"On the platform he can make as big a stir as men twice his size.",
"Prior to describing either the service we witnessed, or the principles of those participating in it, we must say a word in reference to the building.",
"Its motions.",
"It was a great and shining face.",
"And there the matter rests.",
"What charities did they contribute to?",
"The familiar saying that nothing is settled until it is settled right expresses only a half truth.",
"For a family cannot be maintained by texts and contexts!",
"Some beat him with sticks, and others with stones, but he would not stir from that place.",
"Here the affair rests, having by this time reached what I may call its first stage.",
"Though engaged in several important battles, he did not have an opportunity to display great military talents, if he possessed them.",
"She lived in these days a life so silent, and, as it seemed, so remote from other lives, that it quite passed the understanding of those who witnessed it.",
"This, however, enables ships to get in touch with other ships in time of need.",
"Nor was he less embarrassed when he came to learn that the old gentleman to whom he referred was my father.",
"Answer me, sir.",
"The connecting link is faith.",
"As the machine had been there before, we were greeted as friends.",
"On my honor as a gentleman, what I have said is true.",
"She guessed his thoughts.",
"One hand rests on the table for support.",
"Sir, put it to the proof.",
"This will become apparent, sir, not only as to their public proceedings but as to their private affairs.",
"But, enough, sir.",
"Have a care, sir, have a care!",
"It ought to be as hard a struggle, sir, as possible.",
"It is very wide here, and when flooded must carry down an enormous quantity of water.",
"Kind sir!",
"Sir, in this matter I have no intention of troubling anyone for advice.",
"The water in the top of a wave rests upon the water in the bottom of the wave.",
"We went through the wave on the back of which he rode.",
"We rode above the clouds, under the clouds, and through the clouds!",
"The whole population brought fruits, flowers, and chickens.",
"Have a list made of all that he recommends.",
"And such handles!",
"Stir up!",
"I am now going to prove it, sir.",
"That is the only way, sir, to be truly wise and happy.",
"Very good, sir.",
"Imagine that, sir!",
"The only way in which they can think is by talking, and their speech consequently is not the expression of opinion already and carefully formed, but the manufacture of it.",
"The interpretation of this reason by those to whom it was given can be guessed.",
"Before he could reply the train was stopping at the platform, and a gentleman with a lady appeared at the door.",
"Forgetting that they had been traveling in opposite directions, they rode away together.",
"Accord them every privilege.",
"There is a great stir of life, in a quiet, almost country fashion, all about us here.",
"This is not the first time, nor will it be the last, that I have a friendly game with that gentleman.",
"What a shouting crowd there was!",
"My financial prospects are shining.",
"And how about me, sir, me?",
"And, sir, I have done it.",

"There was not a moment to lose, and, leaning over, I aimed, quickly, and fired.",
"One thing I felt, however, was that the trap ought to be secured.",

"And now, it was approaching in a manner of which none had ever dreamed.",
"Then the match burns my finger, and I drop it, quickly.",
"We finally arrived at a solution by inviting only the wives I knew.",
"In what work shall they centre?",
"Other men are soon shaken into place.",
"Just enough food to go through the day without actual hunger.",

"At last, however, our efforts were rewarded with success.",
"Then I but dreamed.",
"It was impossible to get that out through his hide, and they had no stomach pumps in those days.",
"The bad spirits were in him.",
"The grey eyes were lifted to his face.",
"I feel rather shaken.",
"I like the ring of this advertisement.",
"She had graduated with honors.",
"She had not dreamed of doing things on a grand scale.",
"They never dreamed there was gold.",
"After breakfast came the clearing up.",
"The sun was hotter, the surface less good.",
"Eyes more experienced than hers might well stare.",
"I dare say neither of us were ever that way gifted.",
"I have dreamed of this moment many and many a time.",
"There are any number of morals to this.",
"The first experiences the child gains from the world of nature are those of beauty, of sound, colour and smell.",

"Grey as he turned aside.",
"Grey hold him back.",
"Grey continued to stare, leaning a little forward, with his lips working.",
"Grey came forward and greeted me, very quiet and civil, and I sat by him throughout the meal.",
"This letter did not cloud my spirits as it should.",
"The rain had gone, and had left behind it a taste of autumn.",
"And then it seemed to her that there was something in his eyes which she had not remarked before.",
"Everywhere there were tall houses, everywhere streams of people coming and going, but no one spoke to me, or remarked me at all.",
"My spirits failed me, and my strength.",
"In autumn we followed the fashion of the time, and went away for change which we did not in the least require.",
"In offering to other spirits it was the same.",
"When the trafficking was taking place, the spirits did not show themselves.",
"He seemed to be in the highest spirits.",

"The work I have mentioned was nearly all secured during the first year.",
"The time came when I left my husband and secured a divorce.",
"But now came the ancient man, leaning upon his ancient weapon.",

"And he allowed such hunger to come into his eye that she caught her breath.",
"I could only stare at him.",
"A practical creature, she depended from the first on getting a lift from time to time.",
"What was the strange power he had over life and death and the wandering soul of man?",
"Thus they rounded the turn.",
"They are in very truth as trees shaken by the wind.",
"From this window above the street I can hear a variety of noises by day and a variety of different noises by night.",
"Wires all right that way.",
"He told her about adventures on the track and asked about her life in the cities.",
"She was attractive, in a way he had hardly remarked on board the train.",
"They are as interesting to me as most flowers, and one of the most important fruits of our autumn.",
"We will not ask them to yield us sugar in the spring, while they afford us so fair a prospect in the autumn.",
"One stood beside her, leaning upon her shoulder.",
"His efforts were rewarded by a scream, apparently of pain.",
"The prisoner looked worn and anxious, but he received encouraging smiles from his friends in the gallery.",
"He felt that he was in dangerous company, and that his safety depended on getting out of the room.",
"An hour later, he came wandering back, on a different line.",
"Leaning forward, he touched my arm.",
"Very soon he remarked that he had a busy evening before him, and took his leave.",
"Had she, in all the time she was in the building, heard any noises she could not account for?",
"Hunting about, I found a box leaning against the kitchen side, and, bringing it, I helped her up and soon had her on a level with the window.",
"It was the cry of hunger.",
"Each day after this he went on adventures of his own.",
"With afternoon came hunger.",

"I am rewarded for my love of man by myself becoming human.",
"She then began to reflect very seriously on the subject of her own morals.",
"I will not at present relate my adventures on the journey.",
"All the observation was in enemy possession, and to attack over this ground would have been inviting disaster.",
"Their spirits are simply wonderful, and I do not think any division ever went into a big show with higher moral.",
"The rains had begun.",
"Yet their spirits remained the same.",
"The centre group started one hour after the left and got their line without much difficulty.",
"Altogether, it is with relief that as the firing grows hotter we turn back and pick up the motor in the wood again.",
"But even in this volume there are indications of force, and command.",
"One incident of the passage derives interest from its possible consequence.",
"His hair was dark brown, here and there turning grey.",
"There is so much to be done, so many different things to do, so many trades!",
"Then, at a little distance away, he caught sight of something on a tree of a shining golden yellow colour.",
"But I could not concentrate my thoughts, which were ever wandering to that strange mystery of the wood.",
"We shall be well rewarded.",
"This state of feeling is a matter of the past, at least for those who have followed the progress of recent discoveries and of critical literature.",
"But we sustain our spirits with the thought of the bloody murder that is coming.",
"But this is wandering.",
"I remember it was a morning early in autumn.",
"But she did not answer, and my father regarded us carefully, as though balancing possibilities.",
"Pray do not stare at me.",
"And then, although I could not see him, I knew he had undergone a change, and I knew that I was facing a different man.",
"I was too shaken then to see my clear course, and follow it regardless of personal feelings.",
"He was in high spirits.",
"I do not care for women or pictures without colour.",
"As he desired some new adventures he embraced the following opportunity.",
"It shows what is really in it, and develops the full capabilities of its being.",
"That everything in the world worked together on one plan, and each thing depended on everything else.",
"God does not govern men now, or judge men now.",
"Is it to make the people stare?",
"Again he turned to stare at her, and in his eyes was a look almost of fear.",
"They first visited the chief, who announced that the ceremonies were about to begin.",
"Aside from all this, she was growing to like the man who owed so much to her.",
"I forgot, in my fear, that he was secured.",
"It cuts sad great slices out of the time, the little time, we shall have to live together.",
"There was no seat for my friend, and he stood leaning against the wall, trying to get her into easy conversation.",
"They have also, in addition to these rates, drawn largely on previous balances, and I am afraid have largely added to their debt.",
"All straight edges, nothing rounded.",
"This right, however, was disputed by the opposition.",
"This was evidenced both in her writings, and her daily life.",
"She was quite content, since the larger field was not yet open to her, to occupy a smaller one.",
"See how good turns are rewarded!",
"What is colour?",
"There are some people who get farther into a piano than others, making the wires speak as with a voice.",
"Lives depended on his answer.",
"Having secured the good things of this world, he began to feel anxious about those of the next.",
"It may easily be known when they are done by their changing colour.",
"They ought to be taken up in the autumn, and when dried in the house, will keep till spring.",
"It will occupy a little time at first, but there will be economy of it in the long run.",
"This paper should be removed half an hour before the time of serving dinner, so that the joint may take a good colour.",

"The eggs of different birds vary much in size and colour.",
"It will remain good some weeks, even if it be cut into slices.",
"The rank which a people occupy in the grand scale may be measured by their way of taking their meals, as well as by their way of treating their women.",
"He informed himself of the conduct of the troops, and was liberal of his praises to those who deserved them.",
"Nature protects her own work.",
"Only there were rather too many specifics in those days.",
"Might he not join a band of wandering singers?",
"All I want to do is to cook something strengthening for him.",
"This contract called for the expenditure of considerable money for material with which to perform the work.",
"One of the wires had been shot away and gave me some trouble in landing.",
"Even then, however, the prospect was not inviting.",
"It was not an inviting prospect, and as I went on the reality grew worse.",
"By such limitation the people were protected and the central power secured.",
"By his control of the national revenues he secured a great financial power in his own hands.",
"We shall very briefly notice a few indications of the state of society.",
"But that influence was now to be shaken.",
"Those who believe the charge could not be shaken in their belief except by being educated all over again, and introduced to some knowledge of human nature.",
"The only interpretation to be put upon it is that he is strengthening himself in this and every other way against us, and to no other end.",
"Similarly in a short time he secured control of the rest.",
"Moreover he paid everything which he himself owed to any one and, as has been said, he did not exact what the others were owing to him.",
"Those who do not take part in new discoveries, nevertheless, wish to know now and then the results of the observations made with constantly improved instruments.",
"The short autumn day was soon over.",
"There was a booming in his ears and he fell heavily to the road.",
"The speaker was not so easily secured.",
"That it had undergone some severe and violent shock there could be no question.",
"These seeds were all joined at the centre, but easily separated.",
"The whole of this terrible scene, which it has taken so long to relate, did not occupy more than a minute in action.",
"Discoveries from the first curious and interesting have become more and more complete, practical, and effective.",
"At last, leaning forward with her arms on my knee and looking up in my face, she was about to speak.",
"If women could help govern the world there would be no wars.",
"Wet or dry, it seemed that her feet refused to stay still, and once again she was wandering.",
"I sure hope it rains.",
"Almost at once his keen sight was rewarded.",
"All depended upon the farmer!",
"I dreamed of all.",
"But visions or thoughts of home are rare.",
"They all owed him money.",
"We watched them through a glass, and saw a woman leaning over the side of the ship.",
"Nevertheless, as she had thus already served me, I now owed her service in return, and here was the first call.",
"Such ships carried large crews, and were constantly changing in personnel.",
"I had made no effort to impress them on my mind.",
"The whole success of our effort depended on this.",
"I was glad to have the thing hidden, to escape the stare of those fixed eyes, the death smile of those red lips.",
"He actually seemed to be very proud of the fact that he had acted as master of ceremonies, and set the trap off so successfully.",
"It weighed very little, and could be easily transported like an ordinary pack on the back.",
"These people never smile before they go in the ring, but just act as though too much depended on them to crack a smile.",
"There was a horrible note in his laughter, booming out suddenly.",
"There are such numbers of them that if each came once between the last of spring and the first of winter rains, there would still be water trails.",
"So a musician might have felt in the presence of an instrument known to be within his province, but beyond his power.",
"Burns was determined to tell him something, so determined, that as soon as she entered, he felt it coming.",
"Burns was a sad looking woman, with a tired voice.",
"Burns knew there was no use going back through the drug store and listening at the door.",
"My daughter smiles again, and it is well.",
"They put their heads on one side and looked first at their little baths and then at us.",
"He would climb a leaning tree, and then jump to the ground.",
"She never bites an animal, and seems attached to all the other horses.",
"He lifted his head, and what a different expression he had now that his hunger had been partly satisfied.",
"It was a lovely autumn evening.",
"But this, at least, we know, that it will be far more wonderful than we had dreamed.",
"Then a form develops.",
"Each wires to the brain news of the change in it.",
"He burns himself up faster in general.",
"Nowadays people are too much in a hurry both to produce and consume themselves.",
"But now it burns itself more quickly than even before.",
"See there, that burns all right, I guess.",
"But he had neither strength nor spirits to advance a step, or even to rise from his seat.",
"The other dreamed of money and brown sugar.",
"She stood laughing, the life and centre of a delighted group.",
"His high spirits went before a fall.",
"He knew that the charge against him was a serious one, and he saw no way of clearing himself.",
"Is it well governed or ill?",
"He loved his father, and he was rewarded.",
"And so he worked slowly through every paragraph and made it his and dreamed over it until he knew every thought and every picture by heart.",
"Here, every autumn, they planted seed that never grew to mature grain.",
"He forced a grey smile.",
"No more, for that matter, was the grey shadow.",
"There has never been any progress but such as has been determined by increase of births.",
"A woman was leaning out of the window, and she recognized her.",
"Her spirits are abroad!",
"I, for my own part, have never disputed it.",
"It is impossible to fix an exact limit to the time it should occupy, for much depends on the age and the number of the children.",
"There is some connection between manners and morals.",
"No man interested in the training of fine horses ever objects, so far as I know, to such expenditure of labor and money.",
"The colour, sir.",
"She is, and therefore cannot change her colour.",
"In fact, each of them remarked to the others that it had not, so far as he was concerned.",
"On the whole, it was a room well calculated to be as hot as possible in summer, and as cold as possible in winter, but that would do very well in spring and autumn.",
"The other group consisted of the men who were to occupy the winter quarters and march on to the south.",
"That would mean increased advertisement and increased traffic for their line.",
"One can only conclude that he was wandering in mind when he did it.",
"Her spirits had risen every minute.",
"She turned again and leaning her arms on the gray stone she stood in silence looking down into the valley.",
"She was glad to think that he should have suffered, even if his pain was only hunger.",
"What was hunger, she asked herself, compared with a broken heart?",
"And in a silence which followed, the colour slowly mounted to her face.",
"They reject form and colour.",
"I cannot settle my spirits to it.",
"This is a positive evil, and, I think, more than balances its advantages.",
"The patient should be transported as quickly as possible to the nearest hospital.",
"The value of the thing disputed may be very different to him that gains and him that loses it.",
"Such are the discoveries which I am not afraid to declare that I expect from the inquiry, and therefore, I cannot but think it necessary.",
"Spirits will be now sold only with license!",
"In no country is the colour of the human skin so little thought of.",
"His extraordinary character, and the adventures of his life are worth a brief notice.",
"The ports are numerous though not very good.",
"It seems nations are to be governed always by setting up one portion of the people against the other.",
"He declares he has not got the money, and that he cannot pay them, though they cut him to pieces.",
"The foundations of houses, and some massive stone towers, which from their having a pipe up the centre, must have had something to do with regulating the water, are all that remain.",
"His hat was a bit to one side, and it seemed to me that he was leaning back farther than usual.",
"But under visions I had made my resolve.",
"Then I dreamed more quietly.",
"Again he stopped to see visions.",
"It goes in the fall, but it comes again each summer, drawn by the green beauty of the spot, and it has left its impress.",
"They all felt for the slices he offered and ate the fruit without being able to see it.",
"The window was open, and, leaning from it, she was watching the lake, when the sound of a heavy sigh caught her ear.",
"These are the men who serve the city in times of peace, save it in times of war, deserve the highest honors in its gift, and leave behind them a record that keeps their memories green.",
"It is when the stream is clearing after a flood, that the fish will rise.",
"I do not believe that it protects the weak.",
"I attach no such meaning to it.",
"The loans were almost always secured by good property.",
"No creature on earth knows what my poor mind suffers when I go to meeting under such circumstances.",
"I often feel as a poor wandering stranger in a strange land, and yet I dare not complain.",
"He dreamed of those shoes at night, and they formed the theme of his conversation by day.",
"It was like one of those little rooms we had dreamed of.",
"She was leaning a little forward, and her brown eyes were filled with a hard, accusing light.",
"His colour was coming back.",
"Other figures were in the picture, but he held the centre of the stage.",
"Gradually, though, his mind was clearing.",
"Stood still to wonder each bright wandering star?",
"There are here some indications of that strong reaction of the present century towards ancient forms of church life.",
"The little taste of victory did not satisfy a hunger in my heart.",
"It was an autumn night on the plain.",
"He was proud of his honors.",
"The adventures of the night, however, were not yet over.",
"She found that her power must now be secured by crime, and she fell.",
"He was a man who never failed to impress greatly those with whom he came in contact, even when their opinions were the very reverse of his.",
"Having secured these thoughts from being lost, I pushed on into the other parts of the subject, to try whether I could do anything further towards clearing up the theory of logic generally.",
"By his writings and his personal influence he was a great centre of light to his generation.",
"Prefers to remain here!",
"The colour flooded her face at the pressure of his strong hand, which was like a steel weight, and she caught her breath.",
"She was playing on him as a musician plays on an instrument with which he is completely familiar.",
"The colour rushed to his face and his eyes dropped.",
"He smiled as a father smiles when he is planning a pleasure for his son.",
"He looked round and saw his father standing in the centre of a group of persons, men and women, who all seemed excited.",
"The great hunger of these latter years shall consume all the plenty of the first years.",
"Daily grew and increased the hunger in all the land.",
"He brought the same news, and announced further arrests which had been made during the night.",
"For myself, while listening to them, I felt shaken.",
"Hunger came upon them.",
"Some might be shaken.",
"I was standing leaning against the fire place.",
"There were a great many arrests.",
"Arrests grew more numerous.",
"He took to wandering about the streets.",
"The story of his adventures may be briefly told.",
"Consequently he had no similar adventures to compare with his own.",
"If the end is already secured, then it follows that all the steps leading to it are secured also.",
"The, word means being gathered up at a centre, and the centre of anything is that point in which all its forces are equally balanced.",
"There can be no action at a centre only.",
"He estimated the amount of spirits in each.",
"At last he secured a combination which made him pause.",
"My visitor did not let troubles sit upon him, if troubles he ever had, for he seemed to be in the highest spirits.",
"It was a hard stare, but I held out.",
"Numbers of witnesses had to be called who not only were not in our brief, but were never dreamed of.",
"It was of itself worth all the trouble and anxiety I had undergone.",
"Our adventures were not ended.",
"She has not grown older, as have we, but smiles that same sweet baby smile of hers upon us as of old.",
"Not a word was spoken after they had thus left the shore, and they might all have been so many spirits for the silence of the party.",
"In its centre a balancing bar had been put up.",
"She was leaning forward on his knee, looking up at him.",
"A moment he continued to stare into the darkness, then again turned.",
"This, to a certain extent, is correct, for they occupy a large area, and the views from the windows of the hotels, as well as from those of the castle, are the finest in the town.",
"The silent night was suddenly alive with noises.",
"They were heavy with snow which had not been shaken from them.",
"His safety depended on their safety.",
"That is the basis of real economy in association with efficiency, and victory in war goes to the nation which, under stress and strain, develops the highest efficiency in action.",
"There is in most souls a hunger for beauty, just as there is physical hunger.",
"My whole world depended on it.",
"Still, his tiny face was all smiles.",
"Let us go to the baths.",
"Come, let us go to the baths before the crowd gets there.",
"He protects his friends.",
"What pleased him was his own ability, not their praises.",
"We understand the world, and are meant to guide and govern it.",
"The grey rain wrapped the air.",
"They were afraid to let the masters know that they ever thought of such a thing, and they never dreamed of speaking about it except among themselves.",
"He died that night, and we carried his body to the home, which so short a time before, he had left in health and high spirits.",
"Her words, however, impress him so strongly that he calls her back from the door to kiss her and say that he will give the matter further thought, for her sake.",
"This caused a laugh, for their spirits were now restored to normal.",
"Still they were to be found, though it was rare, indeed, that they covered more than the centre of the room.",
"Such an object was not difficult to find in an open wood, and the search was soon rewarded by a discovery.",
"The musician could not, for the life of him, have played with becoming spirit through any one of all the strains of victory he knew.",
"I never thought or dreamed of such a thing.",
"And gentle ladies beneath it, that love it and celebrate its praises!",
"Those visions of mine have all come true.",
"Cousin wears his honors.",
"But today it seemed as though a crowd of excited spirits had taken possession of the children.",
"It all looked cool, green and inviting.",
"It has been hotter than is usual here, I understand.",
"It was almost dark when they reached the tiny clearing by the lake.",
"Of course she had dreamed the writing?",
"There was a hint, just a hint, of autumn in the air.",
"Autumn that year was short and golden.",
"She continued to stare at him.",
"Surely there were more things to love than she had dreamed of in her philosophy.",
"Fresh colour.",
"Much, of course, depended upon me, as I was on the spot.",
"As we were short of provisions and depended almost entirely upon meat, my head man and I started at once for the hills.",
"We also secured here another native, a strong, willing worker, who knew the coast.",
"I followed, and on coming out into a clearing saw the dog being left far behind on the mountain side.",
"A matter of equal importance, though as yet not generally recognized, is that of providing funds for the expenses of forest officers making arrests.",
"But his spirits were too low for work.",
"Grey eyes.",
"It was a welcome such as he had never dreamed of.",
"His manner tended to impress one with its truth.",
"It was like a sweet dream that he had dreamed as a little boy.",
"This, she remarked, made a great impression upon her father.",
"He was in fine spirits.",
"He is in excellent spirits, and I have a rich journal of his conversation.",
"How quickly, how surprisingly, she recovered her spirits!",
"But it was a tender ideal in its way, though it belonged to that past into which so many tender and beautiful visions have faded.",
"Even though she was working almost night and day, she still kept up her spirits.",
"The mouth, placed in the centre of the base, is very large in proportion to the size of the animal.",
"What makes me think my father must have dreamed her is that I dreamed her once myself.",
"But, on this great scale, even success fails to bring smiles.",
"That is just what I have been doing in my narrative of the wires.",
"Autumn passed.",
"In the morning the little girl was found, the story goes, wandering in the field.",
"The spirits of the place had begun to cast their influence over him also.",
"No other indications having been found, we continued the search down the river, examining every likely spot for marked trees, but without success.",
"My spirits are low.",
"But, my dear, although the opportunity was so inviting, he urged not for the day.",
"Habit is not soon or easily shaken off.",
"If now she has so little liking to his morals, has she not reason before to have as little?",
"Whether, when it came to the point, I should have done so, or not, I cannot say, because it would have depended upon his behaviour at the time.",
"And her colour went and came.",
"It was so large that he knew it must occupy the whole of the little house.",
"Only hunger.",
"So they went wandering all the day.",
"But sooner or later they always stopped running, stopped laughing, and remembered why they were wandering the wood alone.",
"Now they no more thought of baths than they thought of breakfast.",
"It was a big sliding door, and now stood open on a crack just large enough for a child to slip through.",
"She had never dreamed of anything like this.",
"He made his way into the very centre of the group.",
"I really would rather be white than green or gold colour.",
"Spirits, come up!",
"She shall pay hair for hair, tooth for tooth, head for head.",
"His spirits required support.",
"My days have been spent wandering quietly over all the earth in the calm acquisition of knowledge.",
"He looked upon the folk dying by reason of their hunger, and knew that they would have him yield the city.",
"The latter returned the stare with interest.",
"He would not have put him in spirits.",
"If he can cut wires in one ship, he may do much worse things in some other.",
"Wires cut?",
"Whose wires have been cut?",
"Different trades.",
"Besides, if one is out to delay a ship, cutting wires is as good a way as any.",
"I sent him expecting that he would try to cut her wires, and he did.",
"My experience taught me that the simplest and most effective way was to cut the electric wires, and I decided to do it whenever opportunity offered.",
"But I suddenly discovered that my views on religion had undergone a change that made this impossible, and just about this time my father came into a quite considerable property.",
"But we can only wait for further discoveries.",
"For what did my discoveries amount to?",
"Summers remarked.",
"The morning after the hearing saw me setting forth on my round in more than usually good spirits.",
"His face had suddenly undergone a curious change.",
"Only concerning the latter could philosophy occupy itself.",
"He was always surrounded by the most gifted men of his time.",
"What he declares to be duties are not even to be discussed.",
"He could be married any day, but prefers being his own master.",
"The centre one leads into the body of the building, and we may as well take advantage of it.",
"Spirits added to the water.",
"Local baths.",
"Nor will spirits added to the water make any material difference.",
"We are to be governed, in these and similar cases, by general rules, and not by exceptions.",
"He had not dreamed them.",
"The baths especially were filled with paintings.",
"He would have been more than human not to have lost his spirits and his hopes.",
"We pursued our journey, and at last reached a plain, where loud noises were heard.",
"As far as the school was concerned, I certainly divided honors with him that evening.",
"Sometimes in the visions of the night I am happy.",
"But where am I wandering?",
"I dreamed!",
"Over this were wound heavy iron wires to give protection and added strength.",
"After many efforts the cable was finally secured and raised to the surface.",
"During this period he made several discoveries in sound which were of some small importance.",
"This did not impress the lawyer, who asked its significance.",
"But no one had yet been able to combine these discoveries in practical form, to apply them to the task of carrying messages, to make the improvements necessary to make them available for use at considerable distances.",
"When shaken apart they again resisted the flow of current until it became powerful enough to cause them to again arrange themselves into a sort of bridge for its passage.",

"Both armies faced one another.",
"Right would still be right, my friends, and wrong wrong, though all the loud voices in the world shouted that wrong is right and right wrong.",
"Considering this excellent scheme, I could not help seeing as a background to it, a very different and a far darker scene.",
"It strips, as it were, the painted curtain from this scene of things.",

"She sat slowly down and drew in the folds of her rich dress.",
"Then I became frightened, and he tried to make use of me.",
"It was the easiest way.",
"This will act as a signal to the rest of the company, the gentleman of the house most probably requesting the same pleasure of the ladies at his right and left.",
"An hour before dressing it, put it into cold water for an hour, which improves the colour.",
"Therefore, when a bird is on the ground and intends to fly, it takes a leap, and immediately stretching its wings, strikes them out with great force.",
"Even qualified or privileged persons must not kill game at all seasons.",

"All knew that the only thing required of them was to keep advancing.",
"Others had knives or clubs.",
"Other divisions attached to the allied armies were doing their part.",
"We know there are more and more armies to follow.",
"For reply he merely kissed her and went out, closing the door behind him.",
"Then a dragging sound, and then more noise of stone on stone.",
"Lifting the curtain of the large tent, which occupied the centre of the camp, she disappeared within.",
"Neither had taken the other into his confidence, and each was simply seeking an early opportunity of getting his answer, and advancing his suit if necessary.",
"He was pleased, though a little frightened, at the result.",
"The armies advanced to the charge.",
"It has no value except when there is some one to be frightened.",
"In all countries, and on all fronts, an army of skilled workers devote themselves to this single end.",
"As those move easiest who have learned to dance.",
"What walls can guard me, or what shades can hide?",
"The chiefs gathered from all their hills and heard the lovely sound.",
"All those that had aided or assisted one of the group in any way the others held in the light of an enemy.",
"At the same time a warmer air gradually spread throughout the interior of the building.",
"The process of inspiring national confidence, however, had by no means suffered through neglect.",
"The streets were full of frightened people with tears in their eyes.",
"Men placed themselves in front of the car, others dragged the frightened woman out again and with blows and kicks she was driven before them to the next police station.",
"She kissed him and gently pushed him out of the room.",
"He shouted a warning.",
"He kissed her hand and got up.",
"The least significant thing about his appearance was that swinging gun.",
"He kissed her hand.",
"A sudden rush of tears blinded me.",
"The far scene of action could not hold his gaze.",
"But he hangs on.",
"I should be ashamed of some of his poems if I had written them myself, and yet there are points of great beauty, and lines which once in the mind will not leave it.",
"They did not come out to do us honor, but to gaze at us.",
"His eyes seemed to narrow, and become darker.",
"When he came out he had exchanged his coat for a rough jacket.",
"Our eyes met, and something seemed to bid me accompany him.",
"She met my gaze with a smile.",
"There was a sudden cry forward, and a voice shouted.",
"We got it into a fish, and I am ashamed to tell what happened.",
"Now she was frightened.",
"Then it was that the look in his eyes frightened her.",
"He had been on the heights, lifted among the stars.",
"She made a quick frightened gesture.",
"She heard a sound of something dragging and could not hide her fascinated eyes.",
"It seems more simple, more natural, and certainly the easiest.",
"No direct information is given as to how long a particular reading was retained, or through how many editions it ran.",
"Then, all of a sudden, there was a cracking sound in the ice.",
"The heart has to pump faster to send more blood to our arms and legs, and all over, and whenever anything goes fast, it is warmer than when it goes slowly.",
"Look at those clouds that are rising over the western hills, and gradually spreading like a curtain across the sky.",
"This delighted him greatly, but he was a little frightened when he found that his father was to stay behind.",
"And she looked by day and by night at the sea, and its cold, cold waves seemed warmer to her than the arms of men.",
"I pushed myself out the door beside her after she had kissed her mother and father and the boys.",
"Others landed sick and frightened.",
"They were standing up, and she was taller than he was.",
"They are doing all this for us, and how are we rewarding them?",
"She soon got tired of biting, and gave it up.",
"Mother and daughter bent a steady gaze at each other.",
"Why should it not some day become warmer again?",
"Each influences the other in a communicating chain.",
"Then it sat up and looked around in a frightened way.",
"He kept on advancing, taking advantage of every bit of cover that offered.",
"Yes, one of the tents blew away in the middle of the storm.",
"Towards evening he arrived on the skirts of a mountain, where there was a running stream, and upon that spot, he pitched his tents.",
"Then he shouted to us.",
"Are they ashamed of him?",
"They exchanged a smile of understanding.",
"The boys shouted with laughter.",
"A girl behind the counter gave her the right shades, and she slowly started for home.",
"The moment these words were spoken, the angry children were frightened.",
"It was darker, here, than he had hoped.",
"Before the decision came, a man popped out of the darkness.",
"She was ashamed to go home.",
"He is taller than I am, of course, with light hair, blue eyes, and a perfect gentleman, mother says.",
"We are not heard for much speaking or long praying.",
"And she had been praying for him so long.",
"Here there were a number of trees, and it was much darker than it had been.",
"That was a long schooling, but it was a schooling worth having.",
"It was a frightened face, he thought, and very pretty.",
"The surprise aided him, for the fellow offered barely a show of opposition.",
"He had just kissed the children.",
"They at last made up their minds and allowed themselves to be kissed.",
"He would gaze at her for hours with tears in his eyes.",
"Well, I thought of renting a room and of taking my sister and her little boy with me.",
"But both women exchanged a glance.",
"When he kissed me I felt nothing.",
"But it was not the concluding one.",
"I interviewed the man who washes my windows, the other morning, with the purpose of getting at the level of his mind in the matter.",
"It increases it, too, by a kind of training which the child gets from no other schooling, and brings him under influences which are no small addition to the sum total of good in his life.",
"But the chief plotting and planning and working out of details must be done by women.",
"Then let her not give place to these desires.",
"The grounded cause I ground, because I will not.",
"But when they got within doors he picked her up in his arms, kissed her and spoke to her.",
"The news that greeted me there was alarming.",
"Certainly the cook had no cause to be ashamed of his work.",
"The tents were always warm and comfortable.",
"Almost immediately and at all points the opposing armies came into contact.",
"He was not part of all that he had seen, which may have meant that he looked not at men or cities, but right through them, to something beyond, upon which his gaze was always fixed.",
"He was biting his lower lip.",
"We feel that his true place is not behind the curtain but in the first or second gallery.",
"If they were as much read as the current editions of the other poet, I should prefer them in that shape to the older one.",
"While I gaze upon the sea, I want to be on it, over it, across it.",
"We feel that his true place is not behind the curtain, but in the first or second gallery.",
"I attended his lectures, and was introduced to him.",
"His lectures, however, produced considerable effect.",
"But it may well be taken back after mating and offered to another female.",
"Mating occurs under water with the male mounted on top of the female.",
"They cannot be convinced who are convinced already, and it is well known that they will not be ashamed.",
"Nothing, therefore, is necessary, at this alarming crisis, but to consider the alarm as false.",
"Is it to be sent her for the payment of her armies, and the support of her court?",
"What may be the force of this argument, I cannot say, because I am not ashamed to own, that I do not understand the meaning of the words.",
"My part of the loss hangs upon me.",
"But these are the facts as they came to my privileged ears, and to what, I believe, are gifts of interpretation not below the average.",
"In the first place, the advance of so great an army has frightened away a very large number of the wild game.",
"I was sworn to serve the state, as its secret agent, for a certain time.",
"She half drew it back, frightened.",
"Perhaps he was praying?",
"The result is that each is dragging the other down.",
"As I spoke to her I was amazed at her wonderful beauty, and I did not believe it possible that the king could gaze upon her without such emotion as would make him forget for the moment every other woman in the world.",
"He had a happy method of communicating information.",
"This strange creature was advancing toward them.",
"The situation, after all, he realized, was not exactly alarming.",
"She weighed and measured his criticisms of the plays they spoke of, and in the main approved of them.",
"She held out, though, but what with fines, and one thing or another, they forced her to leave.",
"He was on his knees before she could check him, his arms, his lips praying for her.",
"It was there in my throat and dragging down my heart, and I just felt as though any way of ending it all would be a joy.",
"She raised her head, and he kissed her lips.",
"He kissed her as he had never dreamed of kissing any woman.",
"I am getting frightened.",
"His tone frightened her.",
"Upon the following afternoon I made an alarming discovery.",
"Panel sat down under a tree in the empty lot, and for the first time since we had met that day spoke in her natural tones.",
"Then the man bent his head and kissed her.",
"And he recognized as he looked at them that, while they were both frightened, they were frightened in different ways.",
"For a moment he returned her gaze.",
"He threw up his hand in greeting and passed on out of the grounds.",
"I am ashamed!",
"It is what anything hangs on.",
"There being now a sufficient number to form a jury, they were sworn, and immediately proceeded to the chamber where the body of the murdered man was lying.",
"I even composed and spoke several speeches at the debating society, how, or with what degree of success, I know not.",
"Why, then, should we be ashamed of it.",
"As for this man, I know that he is blinded by the god of this world.",
"Every day which passes enhances the dangers of the country.",
"He was ashamed, however, and went with them.",
"After some moments, seeing them more and more frightened, I went away.",
"Where is the sworn faith?",
"The police reports are alarming for him.",
"They exchanged their experiences of what had been done.",
"Each one of us had his own concluding adventures.",
"Now all changes which occur in the breathing from its healthy standard, however slight the shades of difference may be, it is most important should be noticed early.",
"It was beyond question a wild animal, frightened at his approach.",
"The gentle spirit had flown.",
"They had seats in a box at the theater, and from the rising of the curtain till its final drop the man was in much doubt.",
"There was a pleasure in debating the matter with himself.",
"So he fell to plotting.",
"His mother caught up the fat baby and kissed it.",
"Once he had kissed her at the door.",
"But it all reminds me that the signal has been given to ring the curtain down.",
"And she felt a little frightened, for almost the first time in her life.",
"I, too, must rise to those heights my eyes are set on.",
"He could have sworn to the fact now.",
"But he had no time to gaze.",
"She had grounded it on good and sufficient reasons.",
"Fines had been imposed on them.",
"Some one shouted.",
"All about them they heard the sharp reports of cracking ice.",
"She tried to hide her joy, was indeed ashamed of it.",
"All these appointments were made.",
"But when the curtain goes down on my death scene, come behind again.",
"Till now our tones had been quiet, and she could not understand one word we said.",
"That frightened me, though I might have guessed it was only a trick.",
"I could have kissed it.",
"The first object of a writer is effective expression, the power of communicating distinct thoughts and emotional suggestions.",
"There is something inspiring in such an air.",
"They were dragging a body between them.",
"It simply is an emphasis of what a man intends that minute.",
"A step sounded on the other side of the curtain.",
"I myself prize classes far higher than I do lectures.",
"He shouted with laughter.",
"He kissed her.",
"She passed the others, and kissed her mother.",
"She stopped, rather frightened.",
"Down there was the green curtain which screened his home life.",
"He suddenly hated that green curtain.",
"They rounded them off at the tail just a little and called them jackets.",
"After the game was over, we exchanged the eggs we had, and gave away a good many to the poor children.",
"I am quite ashamed of them.",
"The men towards whom they were led on the rocks, were the chiefs of the party, who treated them with proper respect.",
"The body of his father was the first object that met the gaze of the major.",
"Frightened at her own shadow, I suppose.",
"See those medicines?",
"He felt ashamed of himself.",
"Was the child really frightened?",
"The balance is swinging true again.",
"It frightened her.",
"They had been praying for the same thing.",
"Do not look so frightened.",
"The doctor and the girl exchanged a quick look.",
"He was ashamed of her.",
"Ashamed of his own wife.",
"A darker shadow in the shadow?",
"His welcome, in fact, was warm only if he stayed out too late, and then the later the warmer.",
"After a while, however, she became ashamed.",
"A sharp crack from the landing sent her out there in a hurry, pale and frightened.",
"Our medicines were of the simplest, and there was but little we could do.",
"They looked back as if to see whether anything was following, or perhaps to look again at what had frightened them.",
"If man so desires, he can command the aid of dogs.",
"Their greeting was a cold one.",
"It was the first time in all his life, so far as memory served him, that any one had kissed him.",
"It frightened him, and he started to run.",
"He felt that the situation was becoming rapidly more alarming.",
"He improves by experience.",
"She kissed his hand in silence.",
"The doctor had no time to devote to such matters.",
"He drew her into the shadow of the curtain.",
"The whole beautiful summer lay before her, in which she was to be free to devote herself to her wounded hero.",
"There were no straight lines, nor any order of planting.",
"Exercise improves the condition of the tissues generally.",
"The time of rising and retiring, the hours of sleep, the dress, the care of the diet, and many other details of personal health become an important part of the training.",
"Some medicines, however, must be used with great care.",
"The same thing occurs with gases, though the process is not visible.",
"Folds of it pass between the several divisions of the brain and serve to protect them.",
"Force the air through such a tube by blowing hard, and if the strips are not too far apart a sound will be produced.",
"He loved to learn, but had few books and little schooling.",
"He kissed her again and she went home.",
"Intends to go out next day, and not to return.",
"Yet, when easiest as to him, my situation with my friends takes place in my thoughts, and causes me many a tear.",
"He desires a line in answer to his fine letter.",
"And again I kissed her hand.",
"It had dropped down behind him like a curtain.",
"No birds sang, for they had all flown away for the winter, and there were no flowers.",
"When they were done, the garden was a rich golden color, and right for planting.",
"And she was plotting no ill.",
"She picked him up in her strong arms then, as though he were a very little boy, and kissed him.",
"She could not bear the thought of being again separated, and determined to accompany him, let the consequences be what they might.",
"What, is he praying?",
"I have sworn it.",
"He took her hand, and kissed it.",
"Before long the weather grew warmer, and there was no more dancing that spring.",
"He bent over her and kissed her.",
"Would he elect to fight?",
"Yet all the time she was ashamed of herself.",
"He got a little frightened.",
"Well, for his part, he should be ashamed to be helped by little soft creatures that had not even a shell on their backs.",
"But, when he saw all the nice things inside, instead of being delighted, he was quite frightened, and wished he had never come there.",
"And yet he was not a bit frightened.",
"Neither was he frightened for he had been doing no harm.",
"It shows that he was ashamed to use the money upon himself.",
"Tight jackets.",
"Girls to be kept warmer than boys.",
"Of set lessons and lectures.",
"Concluding advice to mothers.",
"In both cases, the strength of the mother is quite as likely to be taxed, as if the child received the milk in the way that nature intended.",
"So also is swinging.",
"It is strange that many regard this matter as they do, and appear not only ashamed to be seen sporting with their children, but almost ashamed to have their children thus occupied.",
"Not so much by their set lessons or lectures, however, as by the force of continued example.",
"Her very tones were music.",
"I wish in these lectures to present some observations which may have a useful application in the course of this process.",
"But it was not criticism only which had been advancing.",
"When the time of evening arrived, they left their tents, and sat out on high seats to view the country.",
"I continued advancing on, and viewing sights.",
"He put down the newspaper, and began to look rather anxious and frightened.",
"I walked away to the door, biting my lip.",
"Then, for the first time, they began to feel ashamed of themselves.",
"What sheltered?",
"Many were in favor of abandoning the enterprise, selling the remaining cable for what it would bring, and saving as much of their investment as possible.",
"He went with her to the station, and as the train was leaving she learned for the first time that he was not to accompany her.",
"The speed of the fastest train affects the sending and receiving of messages not at all.",
"In times of storm and flood when wire communication failed they have proved the only means of communicating with many districts.",
"In some of his appointments he had long moves, hard work, and very small compensation, but he and his good wife were always equal to the situation.",
"In most cases, however, the new appointments were crowded between the others.",
"Concluding that I had struck the river at the wrong place, I first passed down the stream for a mile, but failing to find any settlement I turned back.",
"The attack, severe at first, soon became alarming.",
"There was a good show of tents, and the attendance was large.",
"In a given distance more horses can be frightened by a slow machine than a fast.",
"How we strain our gaze.",
"I kissed his hands, his feet.",
"A man sworn to a mission cannot marry.",
"Even the little foot is visible under the folds of her light dress.",
"She drew her toward her and kissed her with more love than she had ever shown before.",
"Then the children held him tight until he had raised them up and kissed them.",
"She felt frightened.",
"In his confusion he misses it.",
"They are not to be sworn.",
"There was that emotion in his face, despite its steady gaze, which frightened her.",
"It does not lie in want of schooling or art education.",
"He had forgotten, and was even more surprised than ashamed.",
"It was one of which I might or might not be ashamed, according to my estimate of the character of the person finding it out.",
"I was frightened and for some moments had not the power to move.",
"Where are the armies?",
"The witness was sworn.",
"The house stood on a gentle slope, just enough to lift it above the range of the worst of winter floods, and faced the south.",
"If he be completely ashamed of them he will hold his tongue about them.",
"All voices were raised in a wild song or greeting.",
"Mating for me was but once.",
"In all the world are chiefs over men.",
"But all these men were chiefs.",
"Yet I did not attempt to drink, for these were chiefs and I was a common man.",
"Should he be frightened by the sight of a dead man?",
"Should he be frightened by the manner of the death?",
"The spring still advancing very slowly.",
"I was ashamed, not so much because I had done what was in the abstract wrong, but because it was something which was not in keeping with my real character.",
"Again she kissed him.",
"Is there any happiness in the world like that of the woman who hangs on such a husband?",
"There is nothing to be ashamed of in telling the truth occasionally.",
"People stopped and spoke to him, and then went on, leaving him more frightened than before.",
"I am not frightened.",
"My health improves.",
"That is, if I get some money to float me there.",
"To begin with the tents.",
"Make it day about that person, so that he shall see himself and be ashamed.",
"At the entrance several women were praying.",
"The licenses are different."],

["The chest is then locked, the lady retaining the key.",
"They seemed to grow out of the shadows.",
"At once, the garden was filled with answering cries.",
"Then, I stood up, quickly, remembering that crash, and the cloud of dust that had followed, directly, rushing high into the air.",
"I rocked, as I stood.",
"I thought, for a time, and matters became clearer.",
"He was meant to be a towering leader.",
"What makes the differences in the social privileges given to one class of workers above another?",
"The man who wishes to take charge of an important department in a department store is put to tying packages.",
"The whole house was up and stirring.",
"This I subsequently discovered was symptom of a grin.",
"The shells are there.",
"The winter had been like summer, and with the exception of a few rains of a week or so, we had enjoyed beautiful skies.",
"The boat rocked.",
"More and more he withdrew into himself.",
"He finally concluded to give up the business, and seek the cooling shadows of the forest trees along the shore.",
"I wonder who would advertise for me if I got lost!",
"What, he asked, was the use of wasting time?",
"He withdrew them empty.",
"When he was charmed with a woman he always imagined her to be like his mother.",
"Here were clear blue skies and pleasant fields.",
"The height commands a prospect to the west.",
"I have myself rather a liking for stirring a fire.",
"There are tunes, too, upon the piano that send me off.",
"Then they had to drag heavy loads along the floors of the mine.",
"She fell to rocking herself in the straight chair.",
"Mommy, please!",
"The troops, hearing the reports of the gun, came rushing out to see what was the matter.",
"On this occasion he spoke with regret of the large amount of money he had wasted, and of the debts he had contracted during the session.",
"The little silver bells!",
"The heavy iron bells!",
"Slowly and in opposite directions they withdrew from the ground.",
"Stirring times are before us.",
"He has been so long used to starring it, that he makes light of stirring it.",
"The long strain of the day before was beginning to tell upon him, and it was many hours since he had tasted food.",
"Take a tree, to make my meaning clearer.",
"When we only care to please him everything that he chooses for us seems just right.",
"Hot and cold water baths and gas and the advantages of a private family and city privileges.",
"He felt that his fortunes were looking up.",
"Who waits there?",
"A woman never realizes that of her lover, somehow.",
"Pleasant memories are among the many privileges of women.",
"I sometimes believe it is the only characteristic the man possesses.",
"They should be practical men, able to adapt themselves quickly to their surroundings.",
"It came on, under full sail, in a very threatening manner.",
"He lay in a sleep too deep for stirring.",
"Mount and be quick.",
"I was black ashamed to enter prison with such a crew, and withdrew myself as far distant as the chamber allowed me.",
"I found one quicker than I had hoped.",
"She had lived so constantly in my thoughts that without her no project charmed me.",
"And then suddenly before me I saw a light, and a challenge rang out into the night.",
"Somehow the thought strengthened me.",
"Her heart began to beat, and the blood to mount to her head.",
"I felt myself fixed in it, standing supported in that position by bands and springs, so that no effort of mine was necessary to hold myself up, and none possible to release myself.",
"Suddenly the sharp commands of officers are heard in front and to the left.",
"Surely there was nothing of war in these comfortable surroundings.",
"He is at the hall door in a minute, in another he is with the shadows in the rear of the house.",
"As they passed the bridge a loud sound of rushing horses could be heard in the distance.",
"He was sleeping, and she withdrew gently.",
"The mountains were to his right, not far away, but caught up behind the shadows so that it seemed a great distance.",
"The ringing of my telephone stopped me.",
"With wet eyes and contracted throat, I covered the face again, turned out the lights, and left the room.",
"I rang his rooms, but there was no reply.",
"Was he daring a contest with him?",
"The skies had fallen.",
"Thus is it ever in this city of strange contrasts.",
"These roads run to the salt springs.",
"He said that his head was so full of new notions, that he had not much room left for school learning.",
"He hung these strings of egg shells all over the walls of his room.",
"As he went, he rang his bell.",
"He rang his bell.",
"The case of owning a home.",
"The spacing of the ties was not regular, and if he stepped short, or too far, he would go through.",
"When the recruits went out, the meeting broke up.",
"It was the time for the ringing of the first bell.",
"It was from my father, very brief, but somewhat stirring.",
"But if we accept the alternative offered by the advocates of strict construction, we shall not find that their case is strengthened.",
"The officers were issuing commands.",
"Came cries from the men, caught beneath the gas bag.",
"We shall then sail north and take part in the battle.",
"They did and this time their cries were heard.",
"Keep on ringing while I go round the house to see if there is any way I can get in.",
"The telephone bell in the corner of the room rang suddenly.",
"He saw the shadows struggling now, and there came cry after cry.",
"The shadows were still fighting.",
"But fear of the club was the greater, and he held back, hour after hour, until now it was silent again in the tent, and he could no longer see their shadows, and the fire was dying down.",
"When he reached the shadows he looked back.",
"Strike sail!",
"We set sail, he, our children, and I.",
"They brought him some coffee, and he hardly tasted it.",
"Then all the water would be forced to mount up, get out at the top, and run through the garden.",
"The moment of weakness passed, and my brain seemed clearer than it had been.",
"These boats were light in structure, and were so designed that working parties would be capable of transferring them from their place of manufacture to the river bank.",
"Then the kind old man withdrew to his own bed on the opposite side of the room.",
"It was no sooner seen than gone, but in a very short time after its appearance cries as of birds were heard at a great distance.",
"But birds that with their wings could range over the whole world were of the land, and now seemed to bring the land near him with their white forms and wild cries.",
"But in crises, as I learned later on, he could show much calm resource and energy.",
"It is one of the most extraordinary phenomena of war, how many shells can fall in a position of no great size, and yet do very little damage.",
"For several shells kicked up great clouds of earth and stones pretty close to us.",
"Quite suddenly I determined to sail her back.",
"He seemed to have known the worst men from all the ends of the earth, to have shared in their business and their pleasures.",
"Then his grin died away.",
"I looked across at him through the shadows.",
"My ears were quicker in those days.",
"And then, as he stood looking ahead of him at the shadows, he ended his speech in a way that had no logic and no relation to the rest.",
"A bell rang.",
"Then he went to the kitchen, replaced all catches and the lock of the door, and let himself out by the way he had come.",
"Indeed, she was happy and charmed to see the boy looking so beautiful.",
"He had never tasted such good tea, and such bread was only to be had in the country.",
"Loud cries were raised on both sides.",
"Their notion of reward and happiness is that they are to have all sorts of pleasures, they know not what, and know not really why.",
"I fear that many here will have excellent excuses and plain reasons, why they should not take it.",
"The church possesses more than one thing of great interest.",
"Cries began to be heard in the air.",
"Then he walked up to the front door and rang the bell.",
"Pray let us have no more complaints about shadows.",
"My dinner waits.",
"Sometimes I have to sit for hours and hours while she catches up.",
"Then a voice rang out.",
"The cries were natural indeed.",
"By mount, and stream, and sea.",
"In such surroundings it could hardly be otherwise.",
"His recruits went on slowly.",
"When the heart is open, the tongue will be stirring.",
"The ship was at the very point of sailing, and it was the last ship which was to sail that season.",
"She did not appear to be aware of her surroundings.",
"He too had had his day, and those who knew him said that it had been a stirring one.",
"She stopped short, not daring to touch him, before his cold, set face.",
"He will sail in a week.",
"Sir, on the sea no sail!",
"Then, they are producing most of the recruits that the churches need for their work.",
"The cries of those which are thus situated now attract others, and thus are large numbers taken in a short space of time.",
"It should be stored away in small pots.",
"Put it into pots, cover down when cold, and store away in a dry place.",
"He used to tell us, that, when he was alone, he heard their bells in the distance, and they seemed to call him home.",
"Or was it such fun rushing about?",
"Every time I come to her she cries about having no home in the whole wide world.",
"Usually they disagreed on such points.",
"He only used to grin at me and never said a word.",
"Interviewing brought him into contact with all sorts of distinguished people, with whom he immediately made himself at home.",
"If the world chooses to think only one rides him, let them think so.",
"Every one turned out when the fire bells rang.",
"Presidents had strengthened it in their messages.",
"Their cries would get weaker and weaker and die out.",
"This seemed to last a long time, but it was broken by distant cries, coming apparently from the enemy.",
"The shells were of special type, designed to create violent air waves when they burst.",
"Shells crashed into the houses, into the shops, into the station.",
"Our shells!",
"One set cries up practice, and another cries out against it.",
"He made all sorts of excuses, and frequently crossed himself as he spoke.",
"Lights and shadows were moving among the trees, and I heard men call to one another.",
"Again he was called to his immediate surroundings suddenly.",
"I had but a little way to go, but quicker and quicker came the boat after me.",
"Nothing can be clearer than this.",
"Justice and love were springs of action in it.",
"In other matters we disagreed, but we both knew which way the wind was blowing.",
"From pride, from pride, our very reasoning springs.",
"He was not able, however, to accomplish his purpose, for the number and size of his ships were no match for the skill and daring of the enemy.",
"These mountains close to the inner bodies of water have springs full of both fire and water in considerable quantity mixed together.",
"He desired to be more than the greatest in his surroundings, and he knew that in that which they counted for happiness he could never even equal them.",
"There was a loud knocking on the door, and then through the horrible silence that followed there came a voice calling to her not to be afraid.",
"When the old man had taken a cup of the coffee he began to take an interest in his surroundings.",
"As a last hope he decided to advertise.",
"Then her voice rang out in the darkness.",
"But from the moment that we had actually joined him she withdrew from all part and all apparent interest in the conversation.",
"That shining joy springs from deeper reasons.",
"A bridge crossed the rushing stream.",
"And that thought, flashing up, would not be denied.",
"It had its springs in the very core of his being.",
"There were no more cries.",
"But we grin and try to look happy.",
"I promised to come next day if we did not sail.",
"A few were employed at some task of hand, and several bent over the pots on fires.",
"I have known veterans to go mad at the screaming of shells.",
"When they were covered the rain would come to wash away the earth, exposing them again.",
"With the gray light came a gradually increasing number of shells.",
"He faced her with flashing eyes, and all about him changed.",
"She then asked me what I could tell, if not fortunes.",
"I shifted my position so as to gain a clearer view of his face.",
"How tiny the boat looked as my glance ranged forward with this memory of our surroundings still fresh in mind.",
"Then came the other pair rushing up, and demanding to know what all the row was about.",
"I rather think it was a ringing in my own ears.",
"Slowly he drew back into the shadows to watch and not be seen.",
"Through the long shadows of evening they rode back to the log house.",
"As they climbed they came into a current of rushing air.",
"Higher up the wind strengthened.",
"Her telephone bell rang.",
"She jumped up only when she heard him start to mount them.",
"Now, without seeking for hidden springs, there were on the surface certain plain facts.",
"Somewhere she had read about air that tasted like old wine!",
"She never complains to the other women, and they call her proud.",
"Word for word, she proceeded with his speech, while the theatre rocked with laughter.",
"There was a rushing about inside the room, and a chair fell over, and some one seemed to be getting out of the window.",
"The darkness, and the heat, and the close smell, and the noise, as we went rushing along, made me feel sick and frightened.",
"The moon made it very bright all around the house and farm buildings, and I could look all about and see that there was no one stirring.",
"The neighbors had persuaded him to bank it, and he was coming to town the next morning with it, and that night some of them were going to help him mount guard over it.",
"I knew he was only joking, yet I got quite excited.",
"He wrote to his mother and sisters, owning all his error and asking them to take the child and bring her up.",
"As she withdrew it she smiled.",
"He put his hat on and withdrew.",
"She stood up, her eyes flashing with excitement.",
"Repeat this a number of times, and after a while the mere ringing of the bell, without the presence of the meat, will cause his mouth to water.",
"His mother realizes soon that he cannot be made to acquire a sense of responsibility either for himself or for others.",
"I want to discuss that first in order to set aside out of the discussion certain fantastic notions that will otherwise get very seriously in our way.",
"Those evening bells!",
"He was just joking.",
"That was just like him, he was always joking.",
"I tracked him because I wanted to make sure he was safe and know what he was doing.",
"The water just came pouring and rushing between those mountains, and sometimes we could see trees, and things we thought might be parts of houses coming along.",
"I could hear the water rushing through the valley and sometimes sounds like trees breaking.",
"We rooted out that old sail maker from bed, and made him sell us a tent.",
"Even they rocked a good deal.",
"Now his eyes were flashing with excitement.",
"President, I wish I could throw my whole being and soul into this problem, in order to make it clearer, as I see it.",
"This very night they swear in recruits, and set the day.",
"A brother waits.",
"Empty rooms rang with the name, but no one answered.",
"Our light is flashing out.",
"So the cries rang out.",
"He was growing a little clearer in his mind, and could see that a terrible mistake had been made.",
"When they were together, they made a study in contrasts.",
"At length he stood, enormous, wide, towering.",
"A calm, clear voice, it rang through the room.",
"That voice grew clearer and more strong as time went on.",
"Toward evening then, we will let the touring car catch up.",
"Then they began to sail slowly down, down, down.",
"Out fell a little rocking horse.",
"And then, all at once, I had just time to send for the boy, and he was brought back to me as thin and pale and weak, as if he had never tasted good bread in his life.",
"Must there not have been strengthened in their minds that particular current among the many that were making for war?",
"The crises had been overcome without a war.",
"This may well lead us to consider rights as opposed to privileges.",
"The child has a right to a place of his own, to things of his own, to surroundings which have some relation to his size, his desires, and his capabilities.",
"Again, what possible harm can there be in sometimes giving reasons for commands, when they are such as the child would appreciate?",
"One of them seats herself at the piano and plays a stirring march.",
"In the afternoon he took her out for her airing in the garden.",
"It was as a family of sons growing closer together, strengthened as individuals and working to solve those problems they have in common, and to make their own way rather than to depend in weakness on the father of the household to manage all their affairs and do their thinking for them.",
"The end has come quicker than we expected.",
"The older cries sound as if they belonged to a past age which men have almost forgotten.",
"As he came to to be apologized.",
"It rang the second time.",
"The privileges of the place are taken away by law.",
"At home there are no politics stirring, but the domestic.",
"If it cries, it can only be beaten.",
"We took our tea, and were enjoying our family talk, relative to our future arrangements, when a loud sharp knocking was heard at our door.",
"The main exhibition hall was quite big and the plants were exhibited in pots in the centre of the hall.",
"They had been brought there by different people and most of the pots had the names of their owners on them.",
"Some are even able to change colour and shape, to some extent, to match their surroundings.",
"We were in fact transferring the male here in order to give it a period of rest and recovery from fighting with other males.",
"He fills a chair.",
"The experience is perfectly real while it lasts.",
"We must equally decline to offer ourselves as recruits for the police or the military.",
"Before the conclusion we had a religious opportunity, in which I was strengthened to express what was on my mind.",
"Light springs on my path.",
"That paper was the daily report of offenses, regularly laid upon his table every morning or evening.",
"Though the walls were strong and resisted their balls, several men had fallen beneath their shells.",
"There was a brief pause, then his bell rang.",
"She answered his question and volunteered other pieces of information.",
"The room seemed filled with shadows.",
"He withdrew a little from her embrace.",
"Then the bell rang behind him.",
"Then the telephone bell rang.",
"But we liked him, were, indeed, charmed by him.",
"She never complains.",
"Moreover, change of skies brought to him no change of luck.",
"The ticket carried great privileges.",
"And no wasting of time.",
"He the skies in frame did lay.",
"Hence, the love itself, if it had not strengthened, had at least grown deeper.",
"But he never could be made to see that these things have any value as aids in the formation of character.",
"Then he dropped his hands from his face and drew a long breath, the kind of breath a man draws who has been battling with the waves and finds himself on the shore, exhausted but still alive.",
"The bell rang again.",
"He withdrew.",
"Who commands them?",
"The door on opening rang a bell.",
"I rang the bell.",
"She sat up, and rang the bell.",
"This daring man was pale.",
"But nothing was stirring.",
"No feature appeared contracted.",
"We are laid in wait for, followed, tracked, there is little probability that we shall escape.",
"It then became his turn to help the boy who had to mount after him.",
"They could hear the cries of the wounded.",
"But remaining to tend him, before long the ringing cough, a single cough, is repeated again and again.",
"The day to sail came.",
"At any moment I may decide to leave, and should I do so, I will sail at once.",
"Within these woods are many pleasant springs.",
"See how he catches to embrace the shade.",
"I think it was the variety of human character that charmed me.",
"At that moment the school bell rang out, and the crowd made a rush in the direction of the building.",
"The band came in with a ringing march.",
"Suddenly a shot rang out.",
"Here was a stirring situation.",
"All its pleasures, all its interests, were not equally hers.",
"Our satisfaction in their pleasures we mention in their hearing.",
"Above, between black shadows of tall buildings, he saw a star, bright, beautiful.",
"The telephone suddenly rang.",
"The season lasts throughout the year.",
"Again her call for help rang out.",
"More than once they stopped, exhausted by the wind against which they were battling.",
"Got to grin and bear it.",
"The only movement was the visible knocking of her heart.",
"And already a thought came flashing into my mind.",
"I rang.",
"Sometimes these shadows are helpful and good.",
"Towering in his pride of place.",
"As the shadows move over it, he sees it move.",
"She rocked.",
"His laugh went ringing across the water.",
"Soft cries sounded in the centre of the stream.",
"We took our leave of the king and his friends, got on board our ship, and set sail.",
"In consideration of this, we released the prisoners, stayed one day there, and set sail.",
"I helped myself, after the service was finished, and I was delighted, for I had never tasted anything so fine before.",
"Then much of her property had been lost, and social pleasures and distinction were gone forever.",
"Everything I ate disagreed with me.",
"Grandmother rang the bell, and sent for all the morning papers.",
"The village bells!",
"By this time the night had got to be dark, and the court was much more so, on account of the shadows of the buildings, than places in the open air.",
"Of the great conflict in which he had taken part, to the ruin of his fortunes, she knew nothing.",
"She would wait till morning, for clearer judgment and information.",
"Now it seemed to her as if she heard a gentle knocking below in the house.",
"Now the church bells began to ring.",
"There were shadows under her eyes.",
"The door is locked and she did not answer my knocking.",
"No one thought to question her and she volunteered no information.",
"He thought he heard a knocking on his door, and listened a moment.",
"From which she took a careful survey of the surroundings.",
"No special privileges are granted to the major powers in the conduct of the organization.",
"The springs at which they drink are long distances apart.",
"The crash of the blow rang through the hall.",
"It had risen so high that the shadows of the horses were no larger than themselves.",
"As our friend had said, the springs seemed to have dried up.",
"There are no church bells in the island.",
"Every man puts upon it as many as he chooses.",
"He tells what he observes, and as much as he chooses.",
"We had good weather, and a fine sail this day.",
"Many good people have done harm by giving severe notions of it.",
"So long as life lasts, food must be brought to the tissues, and waste products carried away from them.",
"This action, because it is quicker, has been considered also a stronger action, and the alcohol has therefore been supposed to produce a stimulating effect.",
"None of them had tasted food since the previous night, and there was none in their possession.",
"The whole city rang with the story.",
"Happy the city which possesses such citizens!",
"Suddenly there was a sound of knocking heard at the door.",
"It did not take long, the knife being charmed.",
"Ever after their tunes ran in his head, and made him the great musician he was.",
"Many springs were seen on the left bank, but few on the right, the water of which was of excellent quality.",
"It had altered its course, and was again coming from the east, and contained several fine springs.",
"Advises her to think of settlements.",
"The people of the house were not of consequence enough to be apologized to, in any point where my pleasure was concerned.",
"The man has really just and good notions.",
"The chair waits.",
"My prospects of happiness are extremely contracted.",
"He has at last sent me a letter which I cannot show, without exposing the head of our family for a fool.",
"They were dark, and deep as the forest shadows.",
"She told how she had heard it singing one morning in early spring, high up in the branches of her tree, and how she had watched it day after day flying back and forth in the forest, its yellow breast flashing among the green leaves.",
"Something in the sky, something in the air, a smell of earth, and a stirring in his own heart told him it was true.",
"They moved in the water as reflected light moves along a wall, not really swimming at all, but flashing from spot to spot.",
"But she was quicker than he.",
"No one entered during the night, and the morning came, still retaining the rain.",
"What pleasure always lasts?",
"Again he rang.",
"I am in need of recruits.",
"He withdrew the hand.",
"They all seemed to grin at him as he passed.",
"They began to crowd round, and became more daring.",
"For on touching one of the springs, it began to speak like a man.",
"They strengthened the city, and made all ready, till men might come to their aid.",
"She was stirring something in a bowl.",
"Lights were flashing in every house.",
"We keep our notions to ourselves until they turn out to be right, and then we declare that we saw through the problem from the first.",
"One can take it off quicker than one can put it on again.",
"When the light had nearly gone out of his eyes and he was rocking on his feet, I spoke for the first time.",
"Unless he fills the stage, an incident has for him no value or concern.",
"It revealed how completely war had upset all official standards and conventions.",
"Was it her unusual surroundings?",
"It seems as if he had come back from the world of shadows to tell us of this awful thing.",
"This seems strange to us, since he had more than enough, and there was no check on his ordinary pleasures.",

"He had run across a number of books on a shelf, and was engaged in looking them over, though hardly bothering to actually read.",
"He jumped across to land and went on, and the incident sank away into silence.",
"At first he would not believe his senses, fearing that he had just gone off his head.",
"It was still snowing.",
"She knew it as well as if he had screamed it into her ears.",
"She struck against the rock wall and sank down again.",
"He sank back, sure of that.",
"The words seemed to roll from his lips without the slightest effort, and apparently without causing his heart one emotion.",
"She reached up and kissed his cheek.",
"Those who could still walk were marched off.",
"I had been longing to give him a shaking for some time, and now I felt for his throat through his thick hair, and dragged him all around the street.",
"On our farm, the boys always shouted and screamed at the cows when they were driving them, and sometimes they made them run.",
"He laid his hand upon her cheek.",
"Her face sank lower.",
"She sank into a chair.",
"Between, all sorts of transitions are possible and occur.",
"But against such writing and such thought we had to count, in those days, great and powerful realities.",
"Money is a good servant, but a bad master.",
"But even in sleep she did not forget the impressions she had received.",
"He had the reputation of fearing nothing, and caring for nothing, that stood in his way.",
"The part of the road in which he fell was exceeding dirty.",
"The next day the proposed weddings took place.",
"Then she got more scared, wound her arms tight around me, and we both sank.",
"Then he sank, to explore more of the space under water.",
"Then the new tire was pumped up and tested.",
"But the train came in, although rather late, and all piled on board.",
"They have the beginnings of it, no doubt.",
"But his strength deserted him again.",
"It screamed above him.",
"He was forced to revise his opinion.",
"As he screamed, the big fingers joined around his throat.",
"But in practice it was never fulfilled.",
"It is a fact, it was not fulfilled in this life.",
"The servant retired.",
"He reached for the sugar bowl and it sailed away in the air!",
"She heard it, and at last lent ear to nothing else.",
"He was always fearing that she must feel bored during the long hours when he left her at home, alone with the servant.",
"His servant had orders to admit nobody, and she herself knew nothing.",
"He does not sum up his impressions, and such summary as I can give here is no doubt affected by the emphasis of my own mind.",
"We talk a great deal about the strength of early impressions.",
"What objects, then, shall our stories serve beyond the important one of pleasing the little listeners?",
"We are just beginning to realize the importance of beginnings in education.",
"A brief and pleasing answer, by my head.",
"What, shall I have no servant of my own?",
"No one paid the slightest attention to me.",
"And then he marched out with his fish.",
"While, however, so much was done to improve the political, social, and economic condition of the country, the promises which were then made have not been fulfilled.",
"Since this business is so invested with human interest, let us go back for a moment to its beginnings.",
"He was dressing, with the help of his servant and the visitor from the mountains.",
"But we do them wrong in so translating them.",
"It broke at once into the iron realities of life.",
"We took our dinner with the females of the family, and then went forth to seek a house for our permanent accommodation.",
"A large proportion of the families in the town, particularly of the poorer class, have one, though apparently without any accommodation whatever for it.",
"We arrived there late in the evening, but had no difficulty in finding excellent accommodation.",
"On land, catching them by grabbing the tail was much faster, but one had to avoid the biting head by quickly grabbing the neck.",
"Did I get bitten?",
"Perhaps they thought that, in order to keep possession of his prizes, he would divide his company, and by that division be more easily destroyed.",
"Secondly, he was ordered to act always at a distance from the king.",
"I have many kind invitations.",
"His more pleasing views of life, I hope, are just.",
"All went well till, going in search of something, she found her little sister sitting on the floor with her cheek against the studio door.",
"The other visitors were gone, and the place seemed deserted, except by themselves and the old man who showed the ruins.",
"But let the dead bury their dead.",
"He shot without the slightest opposition and without warning.",
"I have not the slightest doubt about it.",
"It is a movement that aims at translating ideas into action.",
"The latter bore her, struggling and resisting, toward the lake.",
"He sank into it with a little sigh of content.",
"His heart sank.",
"So little had passed which might have constituted a greater bond.",
"She linked her arm through his, her head sank a little upon his shoulder.",
"He kissed her upon the cheek.",
"He felt her tears upon his cheek, her lips pressed to his.",
"She laid her cheek against his.",
"Under the weight of her arms it sank in the sand.",
"Such disease is, for men constituted like him, the only path to health.",
"How easily his words flow, even when he is saying the deepest things!",
"Often I told my mother my impressions without being questioned.",
"When I became a little familiar with designing and the various pleasing combinations of color, a harder lesson was given me.",
"While we marched in, the boys entered at an opposite door.",
"As she looked upon it, the picture grew more and more real, exceeding the proportions of the chest.",
"I have fulfilled my duty.",
"They had then left the room, securing both doors.",
"He bent over the case in silence, and while they were looking a cloud sailed across the moon.",
"A servant came to meet him.",
"A servant knocked at the door.",
"When she shall have accomplished the time of her life, bury her by me.",
"This shout did not come from the mouths, it came from the souls.",
"The square and the street were deserted.",
"Social movement, which is the animal life of society, survives all political movement.",
"My daughter screamed.",
"The street remained for some time deserted.",
"They lent their street, that was all.",
"My servant opened the door.",
"He passed for the servant of the police agent who accompanied him.",
"And yet it had only marched by short stages.",
"The circumstance therefore of having nothing to buy, but every thing to sell, constituted another source of his profits.",
"Some people are so constituted that to refuse them a thing increases their desire for it.",
"He often lent without any at all.",
"But, somehow or other, our dream figures and the actual realities did not balance.",
"Her little life had fulfilled its mission.",
"The sun sank lower and lower, until there was only time to glance through the other papers in the chest.",
"A servant tapped at the door and handed in a card.",
"He half started to get up, then sank back.",
"A red spot burned on his cheek.",
"A stream of women flowing into a big department store, exercised an odd attraction for him.",
"They made him their servant.",
"Then he sank back once more into the strong solid chair at the desk.",
"There were no listeners here.",
"The road does not pass through such charming country as we had seen in the morning, but at times there are some pleasing little bits.",
"With hotel accommodation at both.",
"She screamed.",
"In the darkness the soft snow piled up on the shoes.",
"She sank on the floor exhausted.",
"The sun was still fairly high, but she knew how quickly it sank these winter days.",
"She sank in a very short time.",
"She caught his hand and rained tears upon it.",
"He ruled the beautiful land, but he had no magic with which to insure the happiness of the people.",
"They make no new ventures in the direction of personal experience.",
"My slaves will bury me.",
"That night it rained.",
"Had not he deserted them?",
"He marched by her.",
"He marched by her without a glance.",
"Again he was investing her with a longing which she had never really had, until he had planted that longing.",
"She was almost certainly taken to be a new servant there.",
"If any little thing was not pleasing to her at meal time, it was a special delight for her to reach out, when I drew near to her to pass something, and give me a blow with her hand.",
"I went to the station with another servant, to assist in bringing the body to the house.",
"We both screamed, for we thought our time had come, for sure.",
"The major arose, approached his sister, and impressed a kiss on her cold cheek.",
"It was deserted, as proved to be the case with all the others, on further examination.",
"There is not the slightest occasion for alarm.",
"In every way it was associated with the beginnings of things.",
"But he had a great longing to see her eyes.",
"Love and suffering had been words to her then, now they were realities.",
"No, we must not relax in the slightest.",
"A full moon hung over the deserted streets of the sleeping city.",
"But she never discovered anything to give her the slightest cause for alarm.",
"And he kissed her on the cheek.",
"And his heart sank.",
"How will the international forces be constituted?",
"He fought like a wild cat, and screamed for help.",
"There was much wishing and longing.",
"Now she sank back into her chair, with pale face, controlling her emotion with an effort, trying to give way to reason.",
"In the quiet of the afternoon this longing became more intense.",
"A servant came in answer to his ring at the bell, and gave him pleasant greeting.",
"He sank down gently to the floor of the broad hall.",
"It was a very pleasing sight.",
"Here too, I had another very pleasing proof how much my father is regarded.",
"It rained much when we set off, but cleared up as we advanced.",
"It rained very hard.",
"He was announced by the servant under another name.",
"She sank into a chair, and covered her face with her hands.",
"Water and salts are not usually considered foods, but the results of scientific research, as well as the experience of life, show that these substances are absolutely necessary to the body.",
"The teeth just described are the permanent set, which succeeds the temporary or milk teeth.",
"Through these pipes the blood must be pumped and distributed to the whole body.",
"It is the medium through which all impressions are received.",
"Certain conditions are necessary that the sense of taste may be exercised.",
"This can be done by beginning at the neck and shoulders with the wrapping.",
"It appeared, however, that the servant of the house had already done it.",
"The farmer was reading the newspaper, his wife and daughter assisting her in the work she was doing.",
"Yet, at the thought of death his heart sank.",
"The tent seemed quite deserted.",
"As it was, I must go somewhere where I need not sit all day and night stopping my ears and with my face covered, fearing that the rocks would fall upon me too soon.",
"But she grew frightened and screamed, and he walked off.",
"While we were talking at the door, my new servant came up with an invitation to us both to tea.",
"For she is dressed for the day before she appears even to her servant.",
"So the boat sailed on.",
"Now ever since that spring night on the shore he had been thinking of the sea and longing with all his might to cross it and see foreign lands for himself.",
"The upper chambers were as deserted as the rooms below.",
"A servant here in court.",
"The street was nearly deserted.",
"Otherwise the street seemed deserted.",
"Embracing her, he promised that if he failed this time he would deliver himself into her hands.",
"But he still went about alone, and a strange longing often possessed his soul.",
"The claims of the law must be first fulfilled.",
"Take my body, and bury it upon the shore.",
"It had not rained in weeks.",
"Apparently she was not according her visitor the slightest attention.",
"He had not the slightest desire to go after his gun.",
"As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.",
"Of course all these envelopes were first opened in my office.",
"Whenever we have had the slightest reason to suspect any man, we have had him kept off the ship and watched.",
"It has been a most pleasing experience.",
"The house was a small one and the family kept no servant.",
"He was last seen by the servant of a relative at whose house he had called.",
"Obviously it was not, however, and I could only give my own impressions.",
"He had great executive talents, which he exercised for the good of others.",
"As it was then fashioned so it remains.",
"The author has added a section on the conduct and management of the mother herself, besides several other important amendments and additions.",
"It is, to keep a little too cool, rather than in the slightest degree too warm.",
"Representations of the works of art should come in a little later than those of things in nature.",
"We must bury him as if he had died a natural death.",
"Not domestic women, but bright women, carried away those prizes which turned the brain.",
"If it can be exercised at all it can and will be exercised by the majority whenever they wish to exercise it.",
"That they have got such a commanding voice!",
"If she should die, how shall I bury her?",
"She passed the window at every turn, and I could see that her cheek was very pale, her eyes fixed upon the floor, and her finger pressed to her lip.",
"They promised to do this, and they fulfilled their promise to the letter.",
"If I ever copied any that were worth reading, I was only a medium.",
"One of them was taken into our institution as a servant.",
"This speeding up makes itself quite obviously most apparent in our business processes.",
"The company within doors screamed.",
"He aimed at her cheek, but he got her ear.",
"It was the nearest he could come to a defining of the longing.",
"We could not see that the slightest attention was paid to the notices.",
"No man with the slightest consideration for the comfort and pleasure of others would care to keep and use a machine in places where so many women and children are riding and driving.",
"He fulfilled most completely in the same moment the double mission of the soldier, to kill and be killed.",
"Nevertheless, he did dress, and he did go, telling himself, however, that he was simply fulfilling a social duty by so doing.",
"At his age, impressions come from without, rather than from within.",
"Then the storm bursts.",
"He sank upon a chair and covered his face.",
"It was deserted at this season.",
"Payment for these services must not be made to the servant, but at the office.",
"There is no accommodation for sleeping, but an artist who could rough it would, I think, find a good deal that he would like.",
"She sank rapidly.",
"The hour was late and the square deserted.",
"Just then a cold shadow fell upon my cheek, and caused me to look up.",
"In her studies she made not the slightest progress, for her memory was shocking.",
"At this time in the evening the place was deserted.",
"He displayed not the slightest intention of living up to our agreement.",
"It had no right to be there in that deserted ocean.",
"The friends here send their greetings.",
"I have found in him no crime deserving death.",
"Church marched off with her daughter.",
"To me they are realities and a law.",
"The long, slow years were fulfilled.",
"There is in the hotel a boy in whom I take the deepest interest.",
"I also got photographs taken, but the negatives have not yet turned up.",
"Just got a servant!",
"Copied it myself.",
"Seeks, not succeeds.",
"False, fashioned, made up.",
"What have we accomplished with our realities?",
"I exchanged greetings with the student, and he proceeded with his inquiries.",
"No doubt, to many, the evening service is no more than a duty fulfilled.",
"I have been so rained upon for weeks that at first I took little notice of it, but very soon changes occurred before my eyes which concentrated my attention upon it.",
"I cannot say that the effect was pleasing, but the girl thought so, for she turned her head so as to see the general effect in the mirror, smiled, and was satisfied."],

["Gradually, I found that I was being borne forward, floating across the flat waste.",
"Through this, I was borne, moving at no great speed.",
"With my foot on the first step, I paused.",
"Here, I paused to listen.",
"Quickly, I reached the head of the stairs, and paused a moment.",
"Yet, this may be easily understood, when one realizes the size of this ancient pile, and the fact that only my old sister and I live in it, occupying a few of the rooms, such as our wants decide.",
"The stars showed now, merely as fine hairs of fire against the dark.",
"I paused.",
"Then, at last, it was borne upon me that there was a change.",
"A new situation has arisen.",
"Who first thought of a cable across the depths of seas?",
"What has he done, that he must be waved down?",
"They did not seem alarmed.",
"At heart I never doubted the reality of the crisis.",
"Whatever truth lay in his assumption of friendship, and I doubted there existed much of either truth or friendship in him, I saw the common sense of his advice.",
"Every modern book worth reading is forwarded to him by its publisher.",
"She paused a moment.",
"He paused.",
"I shall invent a story to account for his absence.",
"The load they had borne was lifted.",
"They were so happy they danced around.",
"Later victories that were to sweep the seas may be traced in part to him.",
"She danced to take it.",
"The busiest little mother a fellow ever had, doing her bit for her country!",
"The speaker paused to see if he had been understood.",
"I wonder whom he danced with.",
"The police had concluded their investigations on the premises, much to the relief of the household, who were now left in peace.",
"These things are not to be borne.",
"I saw a troop ship signaled this morning.",
"They never reasoned about it.",
"It was always summer up here then, and the big chief chased the big game from one end of the year to another, from mountain to mountain and from river to sea.",
"She paused suddenly, and then went on, but more slowly than before.",
"For we have borne in mind not only what is but what ought to be.",
"They were made to understand that they had to produce these tickets on delivering their packs, but were not told for what reason.",
"One of them appropriated a pair of boots, and was much surprised to find that he had to pay for them on being settled with.",
"There was no chance of concentrating on one thing at a time.",
"Always at a dance he danced with her more than once.",
"Somehow it was borne in on me that at all costs I must have speech with him.",
"These last months I had borne a pretty heavy weight of cares.",
"A man, waving a knife, and singing a wild song, danced towards me.",
"She paused for a moment to look at it, and wonder.",
"She paused a little before she replied.",
"But she remembered that it could not be so, and paused before she spoke, and looked up at him with eyes that were full of wonder and almost of fear.",
"That he was a person of importance, of great knowledge and information, could not be doubted.",
"I paused and thought of it all, until the heart began to beat loud in my breast.",
"They looked at me with a threatening glance, and half paused, but then passed on.",
"All things could be borne but that.",
"I suppose I got less alarmed as the thing went on.",
"Then he waved his hand towards it, and stood aside that I might see.",
"My sudden appearance alarmed him.",
"He paused again.",
"They probably forwarded me at once.",
"They shoulder the burdens of the whole family and a few outside the family.",
"Let me first be sure of my premises.",
"Everything staked.",
"But the truth has at length been borne home to me.",
"She paused, then made a little gesture of abandon.",
"In his wake the crowd closed slowly, for many had paused to look after the little man.",
"When she dropped them, they folded against her breast, and her face tipped up.",
"At the door he paused a moment.",
"He began to build the packs.",
"He tipped them and went out also to tip the driver of the van.",
"They were so happy, that they danced on the ice.",
"Once he was marching through the wild country with other men.",
"Next, let us, when we may, reduce phrases and even clauses to a word.",
"The lights had not begun to spring up in the wooden hotel, and for the most part the guests were boating on the lake.",
"Then she hinted he spent money he ought not to spend.",
"She wore boating clothes and had obviously meant to go on the lake.",
"His injury accounted for something and he felt the reaction from a strain he had hardly noted while it must be borne.",
"He could finance the undertaking, but this was all.",
"But they did not know, and some doubted.",
"All the while, my eyes were in the depths of the fire.",
"He stayed my hand, waved it back, folded his arms, as if nothing unusual had occurred, and questioned me.",
"I was alarmed.",
"Patient women shoulder double burdens.",
"Women can and will be the substitutes if the experiments already made are signs of the times.",
"Also, at this period of the war, they had seen service in many seas.",
"The men rushed up and danced about him.",
"The latter was alarmed.",
"Again he turned to leave the room and once more paused at the door.",
"No sound came from the depths.",
"He waved his cap.",
"At the rail he paused for a moment, gathering his strength for a final effort.",
"Hill disappears the night after the trial.",
"Of the man who was seen bending over the victim with his hands on her throat, we cannot speak so well.",
"This alarmed him.",
"This alarmed her.",
"What he had smelled all day was heavy about him now.",
"He finds his wife and bids her come with him.",
"And who is the busiest man we see?",
"But I reasoned to myself that I would not take the life of this man, now.",
"Therefore he kept turning the skin round until he came to a small projecting piece.",
"My mother said never a word, but she covered my face with kisses, and I felt that she was crying.",
"He paused and looked back at her a moment.",
"But as we rode away and I looked back for a last sight of her, she waved her hands to me and blew me a kiss from her fingers.",
"I paused a moment to get my breath.",
"I paused to think for a moment.",
"The man who had shown me in had heard my words, and already had the other servants at work, closing and barring doors and windows.",
"She was bending over me almost before the sound of my voice had died away.",
"She was looking at me with streaming eyes.",
"A brief survey of the country to be attacked would convince even a civilian of the extreme difficulties of the undertaking.",
"Before getting much farther a light, waved ahead of us, told of some one held up.",
"He then chased the other plane, whose pilot soon lost his taste for fighting, dropped into a heavy cloud bank, and got away.",
"The depths in us were stirred.",
"And now again the depths are stirred.",
"But it was not to be, and in the end he was separated from the troop by accident.",
"At first I was alarmed, but quickly I saw that he was a friend.",
"It will then be forwarded.",
"We observed one remarkable circumstance in these seas.",
"They have made possible troop movements and a regular system of supply under the most difficult conditions.",
"This, however, is anticipating history.",
"I paused to let my final words sink in, and because I knew they would hurt him, I spoke them with an added satisfaction.",
"Do not be alarmed.",
"Once he paused and listened, and then proceeded forward.",
"He paused and took a step toward him.",
"Both men paused at that line.",
"This could not be borne.",
"They sang and danced when the enemy were likely to see them.",
"Because he had doubted, his faith had failed him.",
"But surely already, here, now, we may see our way somewhat into the depths of this mystery.",
"He paused and sat silent a moment.",
"She progressed very rapidly in her studies.",
"But we are anticipating.",
"Her last years were among her busiest.",
"Witness these gray hairs.",
"She paused.",
"He paused, his black eyes flashing from one face to the other.",
"He was a seasoned vessel, having passed that way before.",
"With his fingers on the handle he paused again.",
"She was alarmed and disturbed.",
"She went toward the door, and there she paused.",
"She had a large fire and bowls of warm milk.",
"He had had much to bear, and he had borne it.",
"He paused, as if wondering what the meaning of this might be.",
"He paused, with his hand on the door.",
"A place was found for him in a mission boarding school.",
"The truth of it is not to be doubted.",
"Poor people would go out and pass the night in the streets with their children, if I merely hinted that I wished to be alone.",
"The fishing for them is carried on during the night, and lights are used with the nets.",
"The usual way of helping this fish is to cut it quite through, bone and all, distributing it in nice and not too large pieces.",
"There were presents for all the children in the depths of the pockets, and one child after another ran away to show his gift to his mother.",
"Everything possible had been done to keep these troop movements secret from the enemy.",
"A volunteer was asked for, it being first announced that the required task meant sure death to the man undertaking it.",
"He paused, and a set, white look came over his face.",
"He paused for one look at the beautiful scene.",
"For it had been already appropriated by ordinary individuals in a few cases.",
"He looked up alarmed.",
"The seas are not so much blue as grey.",
"Beyond the latter was a single row of chambers opening upon it, appropriated to the ladies and children of the household.",
"She paused, and I saw that she would not conclude in words a sentence I could perhaps have finished for myself.",
"Whenever an opportunity has arisen, they have shown themselves equal to the enemy.",
"No one appeared to be on the premises.",
"Here he paused, listening.",
"He paused, catching his breath.",
"He could imagine kisses on the red lips that were not for him.",
"He heard screams of frightened women.",
"At the road, however, some men observed him and called in surprise, but he waved them back.",
"Then he paused.",
"It was she who looked out for the education of the children and saw what their capacities were.",
"I told him that on the whole I believed it more than I doubted it, but I could not say that I felt no doubt.",
"He believed my story, and nothing thus far had arisen to bring him the slightest doubt.",
"He sat bending forward, his hands on his knees, his dark face far from pleasant.",
"She danced away, singing, to her abandoned friends, who were returning to the house.",
"Her eyes danced.",
"When a second time he laid his hand against her throat the cold of it alarmed him.",
"She stood by the hole, bending over it, listening, wondering if any man stirred down there.",
"He found no words with which to greet her, but lay very still, waiting for her to come in.",
"The summer showers leave no wake.",
"It must be told, and borne.",
"Men would float the ice cakes up to the end of the wooden hill.",
"But now we must think of the present, and provide for its emergencies.",
"I only smelled them, and she drew her hand back again.",
"Seating herself at the table, she held out her hands to it.",
"There was no night light burning down here, and it was quite dark, but if there had been any strange person about I would have smelled him.",
"Wood paused in front of a building on the main street.",
"For a long time no one understood driving the horses properly, and they came in day after day with the blood streaming from them.",
"He said the president need not have any fears as to its truth, for it had happened in his boarding house in the village, and he had seen it himself.",
"It sounded as if I was murdering him.",
"We went through the woods till we got on to the tracks of some of the animals belonging to it, then the dogs smelled them and went ahead to start them.",
"She smelled me, and getting frightened began to run.",
"The pigs bother me a little in the spring, by rooting up the bones that I bury in the fields in the fall, but that is a small matter, and I try not to mind it.",
"When my last hour comes, I want to see her gentle face bending over me, and then I shall not mind how much I suffer.",
"They enter, and the crowd pushes in after.",
"He paused, with his ear toward the water, his face full of frightened expectation.",
"Now and then he paused to listen, and in this way managed to keep going straight.",
"Most of the things in this story are out of our troop book.",
"And then when he came to get it, the boat was gone, because his father told our troop that we could use it.",
"It was as dark as pitch and smelled like earth.",
"The boys had appropriated the seats at the forward end of the car, and unfortunately their selection included a seat in which an elderly, or so she seemed to them, woman sat.",
"She no longer doubted of the reality of his attachment.",
"Here she paused.",
"The dispute paused, while they turned for his message.",
"How strange it was, she reasoned with herself, for her to care at all!",
"He was bending towards her that she might listen easily, as he did not wish to raise his voice.",
"Her face had gone white at the mention of kisses.",
"He was beginning to grow alarmed.",
"The others were glad to rest, also, and soon all were occupying the beds the connecting rooms contained.",
"It was plain that he was going to give something from the depths of his mind.",
"Start concentrating on that right hand.",
"Keep on concentrating.",
"Man will always try to find substitutes for it.",
"Bending forward, she closed a hand upon his arm.",
"He danced this way and that way before the mirror.",
"He danced this way, and he danced that way, and he set the table for breakfast.",
"He always danced up and down before the mirror before he went out.",
"He danced this way and he danced that way, and set the table for breakfast.",
"When he saw the sign he waved his beautiful tail in the air and ran down the road as fast as his legs could carry him!",
"What would ever become of himself and his troop of children?",
"She paused for a reply.",
"Thus, when they at last reached the factory, they doubted no longer, their child was dead.",
"He doubted it.",
"He spoke slowly and at length, as from the depths of a dream.",
"How easy any undertaking, I think, when people are willing to help.",
"Not to be borne!",
"He waved a fat hand about the tent.",
"It would be a difficult undertaking but it might be our only chance and I quickly made up my mind to carry it out if it were a possible thing.",
"A manufacturer staked him at the start.",
"This president is the head of the undertaking, and the directors are its managers.",
"But she paused there.",
"He paused deep in thought.",
"Our spirits showed grey before our hairs.",
"When they found that new expenses required new taxes, it was necessary to examine what could be taxed, or upon which part of the nation any other burdens could be laid without immediate ruin.",
"The other clauses were then read, and agreed to.",
"He that rejects the one must reject the other.",
"He paused to look out over the waters with shining eyes.",
"He paused, apparently on the point of telling me as much.",
"I arose to greet him.",
"She was in the shadow of an angle, and the man paused, as if looking for the person who called for help.",
"We reason from premises which we have assumed, and the conclusion is already involved in the premises and can never extend beyond them.",
"Nor does this exhaust the risks of his job, for there is the land mine, buried in the soft dust of the road, or beneath the crazy bridge.",
"When it is borne in mind that the buttons are hooked on, one can imagine how simple it is to transform and change identity.",
"The trial of hunger is hard, but, like all other trials, it must be borne.",
"Hairs smooth enough here, I see.",
"He caught it, covered it with kisses, and pressed it to his heart.",
"After each shot he paused to write in his book.",
"He laid his hand upon the wooden gate and paused.",
"For a moment he paused before proceeding to his task.",
"She paused for a few minutes.",
"He only paused to light a cigarette and change his coat and wheel his table round so as to catch the afternoon light more perfectly.",
"She paused before she spoke the first words of her part.",
"The old man paused, overcome.",
"As she put the question the log did move, borne away by the full current.",
"He paused a moment and turned as if to go back.",
"But the nation had learned to think more, and new difficulties had consequently arisen.",
"In this undertaking there must be cooperation of head, heart and hand.",
"It comes and disappears, and comes again.",
"She waved her hand to him, then disappeared, and the door closed.",
"She sat up for some little time after her father had gone to bed, and as usual, she paused outside his door and listened.",
"He moved to the door, but, with his hand upon it, paused and looked round at them again.",
"She paused with her hand on the door.",
"All this I could have borne, and counted myself blessed.",
"One morning she danced past a door which she knew well.",
"And she went quickly toward the church door, but when she came there the red shoes danced before her, so that she was frightened, and turned back.",
"This was the marching of the troops.",
"The soldier was almost losing the habit of marching.",
"The people were greatly alarmed.",
"She rejects my suit.",
"It disappears among them.",
"He could see in the depths the top of a very pretty hat.",
"No one was alarmed.",
"It would be an awful undertaking, the death almost of the little children, and dangerous to all.",
"He took a step toward the door, but paused.",
"He looked alarmed.",
"One of their uses is to drive the fish into the nets, and for this purpose one is taken in every boat that puts to sea.",
"Since then he had acquired gray hairs and large business interests.",
"He voiced no fears, no doubts, but the others knew from their own anxiety how much he must be suffering.",
"Emergencies had tested them time and again.",
"But he felt the balance still tipped heavily against him.",
"He paused a moment, but I did not reply.",
"He is so highly prized that when found he is never promoted, nor is he allowed to resign.",
"Besides, the road disappears in places where it goes under the rocks.",
"To invent is another process.",
"He felt, but never reasoned.",
"The man appears and disappears.",
"She paused on the steps, a lovely figure.",
"The sad dance of the child who cannot dance because she never has danced.",
"Everything was cooked well, and highly seasoned.",
"But I could make no one hear, at least no one paid any attention to my screams, if they did hear.",
"The whites became alarmed.",
"We were not allowed to go outside of the premises.",
"He never paused to think of this, however.",
"There it stood, brown above, and grey beneath, as wood or stone was the material, with a widely projecting roof.",
"Here he paused, and listened quite a minute, in the hope of catching some sound from within that might prepare him for the scene he was to meet.",
"One after another he rejects.",
"But even these are rare in the depths of the forest.",
"He alone has rapidly repaired to the scene.",
"But my letter must have alarmed the mother.",
"She paused, but did not turn.",
"Why should I have doubted?",
"They had paused and were talking together.",
"His steps grew slower, paused.",
"But when she paused, so close that only the gate divided them, he saw that her eyes were wide and dark with trouble.",
"She did not know that a silent foot paused before her closed door, listening.",
"Society has progressed.",
"In which of my capacities?",
"He paused a moment, and then lowered his voice.",
"He paused and gave the secretary a keen look.",
"We could see by the tracks that the bear had not been alarmed, and knew that we should soon come up with him.",
"Suddenly the sheep became alarmed and started up the mountain.",
"We immediately fell to distributing the offices.",
"We passed over a spot, which is appropriated for the exercising ground.",
"We had many showers, and it soon grew pretty dark.",
"In the evening the company danced as usual.",
"He paused and looked at the doctor.",
"He paused in his walk outside.",
"Sharp competition bids fair to make the wheel more popular and less expensive than ever.",
"Various substitutes have recently come into use.",
"But the moral power is also dragged down to the lowest depths.",
"He would have followed her, but she waved him back.",
"Nor is this a difficult undertaking.",
"He finds there things which none of his teachers ever hinted to him.",
"They cannot be approached or appropriated.",
"I paused and listened.",
"His previous trips had not alarmed her.",
"She had danced them off.",
"It is twisted over with the way they be rooting under it for shelter.",
"He was afraid of it, and dragged the lake with nets, and then tried to pump it empty.",
"Light showers in the morning.",
"Slight showers in the morning.",
"I have, however, preferred plotting my route exactly as booked in the field, leaving the existing error to be cleared up at some future period.",
"Frequent heavy showers, especially at night.",
"Frequent heavy showers throughout the day and night.",
"Frequent showers.",
"Frequent showers during the night.",
"Heavy showers at night.",
"The day was cool, with light showers from the east.",
"The lady alarmed at them.",
"So I have suited their parts to their capacities.",
"Again she paused.",
"She flooded both bowls with cream, and together they sat down to it.",
"Now her mouth danced into smiles with her eyes.",
"How good they smelled!",
"He was sure enough when he smelled the ground, a good earth smell.",
"When his foot touched the ice we danced in circles of joy, and tapped messages through to him with our fingers.",
"She ran farther into the water, waving back to him and throwing him dozens of kisses.",
"A lot at a time were put up in a row, and one after another was called upon the block, and after a few bids was handed over to a new master, to be taken wherever he might choose.",
"She paused to make a note and to glance over the schedule to make sure of some points.",
"It seemed that he carried it there for just such emergencies.",
"Realizing this, he paused.",
"Everybody was alarmed.",
"It is safe to say that he never progressed more quietly in his life.",
"Above all, screams.",
"They waited, barring the trail.",
"They paused behind it.",
"She waited until he paused not far from her, and then, sweeping her eyes slowly over the crowded tables, brought them to rest upon his face.",
"Both ships could easily be repaired, but it would take time.",
"The others he waved aside as civilian truck.",
"The speaker paused.",
"And then, suddenly, it was borne in upon me that a great change had come over her since the day of our first meeting.",
"He paused and quietly lit his cigarette.",
"He doubted more than he believed.",
"The church is not well arranged for people occupying side seats.",
"Towards the higher end, and on each side of the church, there is an opening, projecting back several yards.",
"Who bids?",
"After they begin to be needed, there is no advantage in delaying to use them, as some do, for fear they shall wear them too soon.",
"He doubted his own identity, and whether he was himself or another man.",
"Who repaired the bridges?",
"Then the father bids the child to rest a little, and try again.",
"She paused by the desk.",
"We need not be alarmed.",
"Upon other days she waved this memory away with a gay little sigh, and would have none of it.",
"He had been in the depths as he sat on the log.",
"She paused again, and passed her white hand slowly one over the other.",
"Then he disappears into the darkness of the night.",
"The count paused.",
"She hung over the wall, her eyes measuring its depths.",
"They must be borne.",
"In the mean time, however, the opportunity for a great undertaking had been lost, and the united generals divided their forces to oppose the enemy in other quarters.",
"This point admitted or doubted, the value of the book remains the same.",
"It was charming to see how these girls danced.",
"He waved his hand to her, and was gone.",
"Her sister, bending over her, could look into her face, and hold her fast.",
"But, I knew something of its depths.",
"Justice bids me speak.",
"They had come to a gate which led out of the field into the road, and they paused there.",
"I was alarmed about her, but she will not die yet if I can help it.",
"Here are the seas, the winds, and the waves of all the world.",
"In fact, she had reached the stage where she was breaking down faster than she could be repaired.",
"When all was ready, he waved his flag to the right.",
"Through the glasses I could see the seas breaking clear across.",
"Greet the friends there by name.",
"Greet those who love us in the faith.",
"She waved the children away.",
"These are dangers incident to these seas and small craft.",
"He was taken up for the murder, but as no one could find the cold meat, the justices let him go.",
"The old man walks slowly along, bending forward every time he sets his foot down.",
"But I did not give up this undertaking.",
"In the country I tried to write an essay about all this that I had experienced, and to tell why my undertaking had not succeeded.",
"I paused opposite her.",
"These sticks are very highly prized."],

["I stared, and, after a minute, seemed to see something, but could not be certain, and said so.",
"Then, as I stared, I saw something below, to my left, that moved.",
"Had the creatures broken in, whilst I slept?",
"Full of interest and emotion, I stared, across the darkness, at that line of white fire, cutting the night.",
"As I stared, they increased, and appeared to come toward me.",
"For, perhaps, a minute, I stood, and stared.",
"All the world was there, and the afternoons passed quickly enough.",
"It is curious to think of all that now, when relations are much less strained.",
"He digs no mine.",
"Upon the head of our nation are set responsibilities such as have never before rested on any one man.",
"Here the possessions of one sex are set up against those of the other.",
"The lady started back, with her eyes fixed on me, and then slipped down upon the floor, and, as I thought, hid herself under the bed.",
"The group of officers stared in the direction indicated, but could see nothing.",
"We stared at each other.",
"The men stared with their mouths open.",
"He stared at the open door.",
"They stared at him in silence.",
"The waters of this stream are much colder than those of the lake.",
"Time was when the stage coach was the model method of travelling.",
"It was none of the ordinary purposes of watering place visitors.",
"Gentlemen, please walk right through!",
"All my life I have been what I consider a healthy minded man.",
"She stared at him, then laughed.",
"They tore up her clothes.",
"A lady in whose company I camped last summer has asked me to give a chapter to it.",
"One day a man who had met with a terrible accident was brought into the hospital whilst she was there.",
"Strained to breaking, it can contract again.",
"Back there, anyways, I had a home.",
"An opportunity of testing the racing qualities of the horse was soon afforded.",
"During the struggle this fell from my pocket, and my hand by accident rested upon it as it lay upon the ground.",
"We had made a morning drive and had camped for dinner.",
"The line was being stocked with horses and put into good running condition.",
"Very fair was the picture which his eyes rested upon.",
"He stared.",
"Again she hid her eyes.",
"The church was a building of logs like the others, except that it was of one story.",
"Why, it was only the coming to the end that a man minded.",
"The man stared.",
"All the fine gentlemen had escaped by earlier boats.",
"True, curtains had been lifted, a little by a little.",
"His shop was made and stocked, and he attended it every day, going home to dinner regularly.",
"The rest of the morning we made curtains, and the children loved it.",
"Every one was in uniform or in what corresponded to court dress.",
"Officers and men were lowered with the launches.",
"The ships searched for us a long time, and some launches were put out after us.",
"How they strained their eyes!",
"The annual examinations were approaching.",
"That stripping was the thing that brought me to my senses.",
"Now I have learned many things which were hid from the eyes of our oldest men.",
"Their hearts beating fast, hardly able to speak with excitement, the girls stood and stared down at this new discovery.",
"Once more she hid her face in her hands, and once more raised it again.",
"I had no further desire to see what was going on in the openings of the mines.",
"Excuse small faults.",
"She held it up to what light there was, and strained her eyes to examine it.",
"She went to the window, and drew the curtains aside a little way.",
"These, very probably, are still hidden from us in the older formations.",
"The dogs will push on to where we hid.",
"She hinted something of the outlines of what she had done and the new agent in the field.",
"There, falling upon his knees before her, he hid his face within the folds of her habit.",
"So let all lie well hid, and watch for my coming.",
"And so it was that he now stared up at the girl.",
"And the fact disturbed him more than a leveled gun would have done.",
"Till her death day she would not forget the fire with which he had stared up at her from the foot of the stairs.",
"This thing has taken careful planning and concerted effort.",
"These gentlemen wish to identify him.",
"Getting up, she stole, to the one window which the long room afforded.",
"The old man stared at the speaker breathing hard.",
"They stared at the strangers.",
"The farmers tried to catch her in their traps.",
"He and his men hid in the dark woods.",
"With all his faults, he would not tell a lie.",
"Of these the only one that need concern us here is that the wording of a passage may not be abstract and yet be general.",
"In these we perceived they had all hid themselves, as I suppose they usually did upon such occasions.",
"Whilst I was out that time, I took upon my wages only one pair of shoes.",
"Then she turned her head and he saw her face was rather white and her look was strained.",
"She thought she knew who lay behind the screens, and her look was strained.",
"They suddenly form thick beds or carpets on the ground, in this gentle air, or even without wind, just the size and form of the tree above.",
"Northern brain and muscle were toughest, and let water find its own level.",
"Old gentlemen complain of the cost of our houses.",
"He stood still, looking first at the bed, whose curtains were down, then around the room.",
"The people in the restaurant never spoke above a whisper, and when the troops passed were as silent as death.",
"The crowd strained its eyes.",
"She had more to say for herself, and laughed and talked with the gentlemen just as if she was one of themselves.",
"Hill minded the shop.",
"He jumped over the fence at the side and hid in the garden.",
"Gentlemen, does a man commit a murder for a thing of that kind?",
"I was afraid, and I hid myself behind the curtains in the hall.",
"I picked it up and hid it in my bag.",
"I took them all and hid them in my bag, and then I closed the hiding place.",
"He has the faults and has lived the life of a social favourite.",
"Then he sat down, and hid his face in his hands.",
"I was minded several times to return.",
"There were great human faces on the wall, but they did not move or speak, but stared at him in a way he had never seen people look before.",
"One could have heard a whisper in the room now.",
"He lost all his possessions, and began to wash for people.",
"The next day he stayed in the house and tore his face.",
"However, I am not minded to set down here all our fears.",
"She reached out her hand to where his rested upon his knee.",
"The first teaches us how to know the stars and planets, and to find their places and motions.",
"Whilst during life he had experienced no symptoms corresponding to these appearances.",
"We both stared after him, until he turned the corner and was out of sight.",
"I dropped beside him, and tore away his shirt.",
"It was necessary almost every day to withdraw certain formations from the front and send them back a considerable distance to water, replacing them by other troops coming from a well centre.",
"Supplying the front.",
"When he had satisfied his hunger, he began to look round him, still stared at by the others.",
"Moving a step back he stared at it, and the flower seemed like a thing alive that looked back at him, and asked him why he had hurt it.",
"He stood up and stared all round to see if anything was coming, but he could see nothing and hear nothing.",
"I strained my ears, but could hear no sound save that of someone moving within.",
"The house was, I found, somewhat smaller than its neighbors, but not let out in flats as the others.",
"Here every one spoke in a low whisper or by signs.",
"They lay about on the stone floor, sleeping like logs.",
"Our men were worn out, most of them, and slept like logs.",
"It seemed to me that there was no one too busy to stop and look, to turn and whisper a word to someone else.",
"We made an interesting journey through the provinces, did we not, my lady?",
"The others stood watching my father with strained attention.",
"They have sail ready now, gentlemen.",
"Then she spoke, and her voice was almost a whisper.",
"Neither was primed.",
"Grant stared again at the card.",
"There were horses enough to be had in the provinces, and for money.",
"I shall only have a few copies struck off in the cheapest manner.",
"The old man came in whilst I was there.",
"Besides, going about cleaning and arranging the little empty things in this way looked almost like doing business.",
"In every case I had the great advantage of being thus accompanied by gentlemen who were friendly and familiar with the poor we visited.",
"Is it not suspended in space like all of the other planets?",
"And when it did, the planets began to form.",
"Either way, it was interesting to note that they were contemporaries.",
"Possibly even to other planets!",
"She was a quiet woman who minded her own business.",
"In some places the loss amounted to half the resident population.",
"Do those gentlemen see what that may lead to?",
"The success of that stroke insured all that he aimed at.",
"As they approached it, its outlines became more defined.",
"She sat down at the piano, and her strong, small hands tore the heart out of each wire.",
"The girl looked at her cousin with something in her honest blue eyes that almost amounted to wonder.",
"Added to this warm smell there is the smoke of a score of the very cheapest cigarettes.",
"But the man who waits until he is secure against the unknown never discovers anything, not even himself.",
"They force him to live in places not fit for rats, and on top of everything else they call him names, so that their kids stick up their noses at his children in the school grounds.",
"He was a gentleman that had a will of his own and a eye of his own, and that would be minded.",
"It should be strained, and put by in a cool place until wanted.",
"When strained, it will be ready for use.",
"Top boots are still occasionally worn by gentlemen.",
"We then moved further to the rear and camped for the night.",
"Suddenly a whisper passed on from man to man.",
"Both men leveled their guns, and for a moment faced each other.",
"Is that building filled with dollars, into which the gentlemen are now entering?",
"Whilst speaking he had backed himself into the opening which was just enough to hold him.",
"He, too, did not notice me whilst I was passing.",
"Therefore some hid their property and took care to protect themselves, and others considered in what way they might make their escape.",
"My host looked on with some interest whilst I did this, and bent his head as if in approval.",
"But from considerations of space only the outlines of the picture can be given.",
"He dropped the cup and stared.",
"Here he hid and watched.",
"He rested a moment.",
"Occasionally we sat down and rested upon some flat rock.",
"He told us to go to the opposite side of the gallery, and he would whisper to us.",
"I heard voices calling attention to me, while curious eyes stared into my face.",
"Yet that would only mean the death of all hope, and I turned my eyes away from him, and stared with the others at the opening door.",
"We will whisper the truth to these, and have them ready for a signal.",
"I stood there a moment silent, considering this information, and rapidly arranging in mind our future operations.",
"Depressed by the sight, my eyes sought the face of the girl whose head yet rested against my shoulder.",
"When one of these fits came upon him he would get red in the face, and show the greatest difficulty in framing certain words.",
"That whisper the man heard, it seemed to him, less with his ears than with his soul.",
"She began arranging her hair.",
"As she sat up and stared at him she read his intentions.",
"The rocks, like the river, were black, and looked far colder than the white world which extended in all directions.",
"He stared at her.",
"Now, when having spoken his mind he turned away from her, she stared after him and watched him as he dropped back by the fire.",
"She stared out and did not think.",
"She rested, lying on her back, her eyes closed.",
"For they stand in need of their proper elements, and of that which conducts them to the generation of one form.",
"The land seemed not to miss him any more than it had minded him, but I missed him and could not forget the trick of expecting him in least likely situations.",
"Their noses got more and more red, it is true, but they knew when they were in the house, near the warm fire, the red would all fade out.",
"But in the night it got colder and colder.",
"All at once he felt rested and full of energy.",
"The doctor had heavy curtains at each door in his office, and had a way of leaving the key in the door, that cut off the last hope.",
"On the top of these are placed logs which rest even with the ground.",
"She said clubs were for big dogs and switches for little dogs, if one had to use them.",
"I stood on the table staring hard at her, and she stared hard at me.",
"Of course I did not know, so I only stared at her.",
"They only lifted their heads and stared at her when she called them.",
"There they rested.",
"He let his servant draw him aside and address him in a whisper.",
"It has become colder.",
"But space presses, and I fear that I have written too much already.",
"That this earth, like all the planets, must have been once in a state of intense heat throughout, as its mass inside is probably now.",
"Here and there were little openings, in some of which green grass grew.",
"I hid the gun and then, when I went to see if it was safe, it was gone.",
"With no concerted plan we feel called upon to serve it.",
"We easily forget our faults when nobody knows them.",
"They were therefore pleased with the intelligence, because it afforded a new and powerful reason for getting rid of him.",
"Let our tears wash away the faults we have committed.",
"The sun was setting, for the clouds had cleared, and never was a sight half so beautiful to the anxious eyes that rested on it.",
"On the shoulder his hand rested, as by accident.",
"Gentlemen, we all know our posts.",
"I thought they were gentlemen.",
"Soon a bend of the road hid them from view.",
"Every one who thinks, writes, or speaks in public, knows how his style alters, as fresh knowledge and experience come to him.",
"This was in a whisper.",
"If our friend have faults, we must bear with them.",
"She put a knee behind his shoulders for support, and he rested his head back upon it and drank deep from the glass which she held to his lips.",
"Then he was so scared that he ran and hid.",
"The children were already at table, with their noses in their cups, when a ring at the street door was heard.",
"The children have rolled and leveled the surface and laid it off in square beds with walks between.",
"The underlying reason for this is found in the economic circumstances of the country and in the situation in which the provinces found themselves during the years after the war.",
"She slowly tore the letter into pieces and threw it on the fire.",
"She seemed to be arranging something in her mind.",
"We have worked for both these gentlemen.",
"One of these gentlemen told us, that when a medical man intended settling in a new situation, he always, if he knew his business, walked through the streets at nights, before he decided.",
"Little is spoken, except a whisper between the married pairs.",
"He is far more interested in chatting with his customers about fish than making money selling them.",
"It was the first time I was travelling alone and I was quite nervous.",
"Another time I was on the last step of a bus which I thought would be quite okay for I had seen many people travelling while hanging at the doors of crowded buses.",
"We drove to his house, me chatting away in reply to all his questions.",
"Many logs were thrown nearby.",
"But as to the address, I wish gentlemen would a little consider the occasion which produced it.",
"Desert travelling after all is mostly an affair of luck.",
"Some other gentlemen came in.",
"This family once enjoyed large possessions, but, like others, have lost them in the progress of ages.",
"The fellow stared, then woke up with a start and disappeared within.",
"West stared.",
"They were talking of this as the old lady suspected, and of course the following conversation afforded her intense satisfaction.",
"He will be there with a party of gentlemen.",
"Death achieves his victory as frequently with one as with another.",
"On the subject of marrying our daughters, for instance, instead of qualifying them to make a proper choice, they are generally left to pick up such principles and opinions as they may come at, as it were by chance.",
"When once allowed to exist, in the breast of the parent, though hid apparently from all other eyes, its sad consequences begin to show themselves.",
"But whilst the masses know what they want, they often do not know how to express their wants and, less often, how to get what they want.",
"I have not come to say anything about gentlemen being too long over their smoking.",
"They are a committee, and will not care for the society of gentlemen.",
"I commented a little on the subject, which afforded me great satisfaction and joy.",
"He was besides extremely cross, full of complaints of the soldiers who were stationed there.",
"He strained his eyes until it seemed as though they would burst, to follow the movements of that boat on which their lives depended.",
"He bought newspapers, took them into a sheltered corner, and tore them open.",
"Men died every second whilst women danced, and no one who knew life had any care save for the measure of their own days.",
"We corresponded always.",
"His great voice seemed to have faded into a whisper.",
"She stared at the paper in her hand.",
"She paused, struggling for breath, tore her hat from her head and threw it on the table.",
"She rested her hands upon his shoulder.",
"They both stared at the instrument.",
"He stared at my brother.",
"He spoke in a whisper, as if to himself.",
"It was now so dark that I could barely distinguish the outlines of our guide, who walked ahead of me.",
"His thoughts had been travelling along the same lines as mine, and at about the same pace.",
"Then he stared at the man.",
"She thought he was merely protesting against her going alone.",
"It is full of the faults of the age.",
"By slow degrees he discovers that here it is not, and there it is not.",
"Some one threw up the curtains, and the room was filled with sudden light.",
"People had stared at me.",
"Too soon my turn came, and I paused a moment behind the curtains for a deep breath.",
"He catches a low whisper.",
"A flight of worn steps led to a broad glass door, and opening the latter, the girl passed under a curved wooden gallery into a broad hall.",
"I thought that kind of thing was out of date now, and that gentlemen only called the police on such occasions.",
"Her eyes rested on his for a moment, then she passed on.",
"She could say nothing but that the king answered to her, there was nothing hid from him.",
"She turned her steps toward the door, and the men, who had stationed themselves to guard it, withdrew, and suffered her to pass.",
"He goes a great deal into society, and conducts commercial operations.",
"They exchanged quickly a few words in a whisper.",
"He loved his children and, despite her faults, he loved his wife.",
"A box which he had brought from the ship afforded her a seat.",
"They rested but a moment and again pressed on.",
"Good gentlemen, did any see my heard?",
"No, whilst these wake.",
"He must buy nothing new to wear, and must live at the cheapest of the restaurants.",
"And now had come some colder weather, and ice had formed above the waiting waters which spread out so in all directions.",
"She had taste for outlines and color, and she was very fair to look upon.",
"It struck the ground and tore loose above.",
"In one corner was a pile of carpets.",
"Step up, gentlemen.",
"Our traps are probably burned, or stolen.",
"The wind blew colder and he went below.",
"He must have relaxed his hold, for the girl tore herself loose.",
"This time his burden was heavier, although there were men who would not have minded that under the circumstances.",
"Travelling we found very pleasant.",
"She had come, of course, to look at the traps, but some one must have accompanied her.",
"He went and hid in the woods.",
"She stared.",
"A turn in the trail hid her.",
"He could not stand much of this sort of thing without collapsing himself.",
"The prisoners gave considerable help, especially when the ship caught fire whilst starting the motor again.",
"Every available small craft that could be fitted for the work was pressed into the service, including a considerable number of motor launches.",
"I stared at her, feeling more than ever like one in a dream.",
"Everyone turned and stared.",
"It was as if I could see through the dark, to what it hid.",
"I stared at her.",
"It strained our vision and took our attention from our work.",
"But he had a nose to beat all noses!",
"I had then no intention of travelling.",
"He tore at his own hair.",
"But his picture, like the previous pictures from which it was compounded, is simply a physical impression on the brain, just as much as those in dreams.",
"And now, ladies and gentlemen, take from hence a lesson.",
"Let us pass on, gentlemen.",
"Gentlemen, think of this.",
"In the rest, gentlemen, let us think, and let us observe.",
"They stared at her.",
"I took these bags, carried them about a half mile up the road, and hid them in a fence corner, where I could get them in the morning when I had started on my trip.",
"He gave me some food, and hid me away for the night in his house.",
"There was no talking above a whisper, for fear of being heard by the soldiers.",
"The girls stared at one another a moment and then began laughing.",
"The boy stared.",
"The scene was so very different from that it had presented when the flats were covered with water, that it was impossible not to feel the change.",
"Suddenly the girl stopped, threw herself on a log, and hid her face.",
"The major opened the gate of the field, and stationed himself in a way to turn the animals in the desired direction, while his father went into the stable to set them free.",
"Here are some human lies laid down against the periods of its growth, to which they corresponded.",
"As a matter of fact since coming here I have rested as I have not rested for a year.",
"Her curved mouth was set in a hard red line.",
"She had often camped there with her father.",
"He hid.",
"It was only a whisper but it seemed to fill the universe.",
"In the end it amounted to exactly the same thing.",
"She tore it into small pieces.",
"It amounted to nothing.",
"Eventually he put all the papers together, arranging them in sequence.",
"He lowered his voice to a whisper.",
"Never mind the people who are already here, gentlemen.",
"The responsibility of decision rested with him and he had made his decision.",
"Some men know only how to whisper.",

"But the lady with the gray hair and the odd little twist to her smile now leaned forward and took a hand in the conversation.",
"He shaded his eyes with both hands, as if the sun were shining in his face.",
"So she would be hunted day and night.",
"She must have thought that she would be hunted.",
"The men grew thinner and thinner.",

"The wire roads were a great help to us, and the officer who first thought out the idea received our daily blessings.",
"Yet she dared not speak.",
"The fellow must have actually dared to return to the spot and carry off the victim.",
"If he had dared, he would have struck me down at his feet.",

"I had been dreaming I was a very great man.",
"I was fooled, too.",
"These lists and their grading vary in the different states, although the same poems are used in many of them and there are some which are required in every state.",
"Since the grading in different states varies so widely, teachers will find included, also, many poems which in their own particular states are required in other grades.",

"They would often get together on a back street and in whispered tones wonder if they had yet been suspected.",
"Foot by foot the ground was contested, a single narrow strip of open land dividing the opponents.",
"They told me their officers had fooled them.",
"A far greater effort has been put forth by the allied armies and staffs to assist us than could have been expected.",
"I leaned on my stick and looked after him.",
"Has life no joys for me?",

"He says that after he finishes his studies, he is going to live with his father and mother.",
"The company outside the door was somewhat thinner than common.",
"The crowd which has gathered stares without answering.",
"As the strongest link in the chain, or as the weakest, it rules.",

"There was a stir within, a few whispered words, and then the door was opened.",
"A few sided with the boys, but the majority shook their heads.",
"Tonight they dared not bother him.",
"Still they dared not approach him.",
"On the other side of the house, however, the woods showed brighter.",
"On the east side the house leaned against a mass of white stone.",
"He swung his gun wide and leaned to see how serious was the damage he had done.",
"If he had dared he would have told me to kill it!",
"Had they been dreaming?",
"For half an hour there was no mastering him, but all at once he broke down.",
"That is a question which I imagine can only be answered by guesses.",
"Or is it the touching sight of so much happiness contrasted with what we know the home life to be?",
"Now as to compromises.",

"The outside man, and tallest of the lot.",
"The position of the moon cast the whole of the narrow passage which flowed beneath the windows of her private apartments into shadow.",
"He kissed the burning cheek of his sister as she touched the ground, and whispered significantly.",
"Perhaps she felt that she did not pray for him as she prayed for others.",
"She would have it so, and her mother neither dared nor knew how to control her.",
"I hope they have but I do know that they undertook to forget the differences.",
"But their lawyers had left their desks.",

"I trust a brighter star has risen above the old house, and that it is entering upon brighter fortunes.",
"She turned away from him, her eyes full of tears which she dared not let him see.",
"God there deals blessings.",
"Serious reflections arise in the presence of all the details of the great crime which this book is designed to relate.",
"That alarms it.",
"He leaned quickly forward out of the window.",
"Frequently paper was lacking, pens were wanting.",
"Then he leaned back, very still, in his chair, with his eyes shut.",
"The forest becomes thinner now.",
"Then, later, came other reflections.",
"He had but yielded to a fancy of a dreaming girl, and put her even farther away from him while wasting half a fortune!",
"Its meaning flashed upon him.",
"If he dared only stop a moment!",
"I liked him, and could always deal with him on a level footing.",
"To have joys in common is the dream of man and wife.",
"And the experience was even more interesting and exciting than they had dared to hope!",
"Then she pulled his head down to her, her eyes shining, and whispered a quick sentence in his ear.",
"The little girl had always had a share in the joys of her parents.",
"Frequently I prayed, but found no comfort in it.",
"He dared not speak.",
"The evils of the trade came close to her.",
"Finally when I rode out to rescue him, he sided in with the other fellow.",
"It was hard to find level footing.",
"He dared not.",
"They dared not wait for him.",
"The last few hours had put them on a somewhat different footing.",
"When they came to forests, now thinner, smaller, and less frequent, they welcomed them as they would an old friend.",
"Her eyes flashed a challenge at him.",
"He dared not go to see her for fear she might discover it.",
"Quickly her glance flashed up at him.",
"I dared not begin again.",

"Yet he dismisses without notice his thought because it is his.",
"He is the safest man in all ways.",
"There were plenty of whispered stories current as to his true identity.",
"It was as if, the worst having happened to her, she dared everything now.",
"The old women were so glad that they sang and prayed.",
"It was shown him, and its workings explained.",
"Then the picture flashed upon the screen.",
"All this in the pauses of the dance.",
"She must act, for she dared not hesitate.",
"He was thinking whether he dared to work on his mother to get the desired permission.",
"Her husband had whispered a few words to her, so she understood at once the whole situation.",
"He seemed to have been dreaming about dogs.",
"They came back very slowly along the shaded trail to where the car stood waiting in the brilliant light of the declining sun.",

"He leaned back and closed his eyes.",
"Brown dared not trust himself to answer.",
"Twice she looked up at him, standing there by the boarded windows.",
"Certain districts were hunted and trapped over in certain years.",
"In this country, and at that time, the sheep were not much hunted.",
"On the other hand, many of them find their chief function as game preserves, as do also to still greater extent the national parks.",
"So they flashed at each other as the one side waited and the other passed.",
"But he was still very weak, and he hardly dared to hope that he could survive another round.",
"My son was also face to face with death, and he prayed, also.",
"Now, now, if he dared to go home to her this night, and tell her that their son was alive, was found, was coming back to them!",
"They whispered together for a few moments and then returned.",
"The old man did not answer, he was too greatly surprised and angered to reply.",
"She leaned over and kissed him.",
"He knew now that the fellow never would have dared to appear in court as a witness.",
"There was, usually, plenty of life, though, up in the workings to which he distributed his cars.",
"He had one match left but he dared not light it.",
"He leaned back then, and closed his eyes and lay quite still.",
"But the slope was the nearest and the way to it was the safest, and there was no time to wait.",
"I always approve of the moral, often of the political, reflections.",
"How dared he?",
"She leaned out of the bed to listen to them.",
"Her heavy reflections upon the contents.",
"I have got her to own that she prayed for me.",
"I fancy it will go a great way towards making me a reformed man.",
"This indeed alarms me.",
"No reflections upon her memory!",
"They fell over him, a steady, gentle shower, and he slept long, and without dreaming anything.",
"A bird flashed from the trees.",
"When she stood still they leaned against her, one against either side, and wound their arms about her.",
"A strange thought flashed into her mind.",
"She took him aside and whispered something to him.",
"Then he leaned over and pressed a kiss upon her cheek.",
"He whispered something in her ear, and for a long while they stood in silence, her arms around his neck.",
"Listen well to that he prayed his friends.",
"All that he dared of love he showed.",
"Nothing he dared to destroy or steal.",
"Not a soul but prayed that he might come to an evil end.",
"He could not, and dared not, wait longer.",
"She leaned against the table.",
"He had seen the trap after it had been sprung.",
"At every step the footing gave a little.",
"She had never been hunted before.",
"Some of the traces were, indeed, more informing.",
"Greater evils than those of war threatened the stability of the state.",
"She washed on, and the good man above prayed on.",
"Evils produced by having it too tight.",
"Evils of having them too tight.",
"Evils of using it as such.",
"Physical evils attending their use.",
"Intellectual evils.",
"Moral evils.",
"Evils of sitting up late at night.",
"Evils of being able to use but one hand.",
"Evils produced.",
"But all these evils, as has already been said, may be prevented, if the hand is placed so as to support the head and shoulders.",
"What could he be dreaming of?",
"Then he walks over them and kicks them, and then he lifts them up and shakes hands all round to make them friendly like.",
"I hunted all over town to find it.",
"This, to me, is one of his weakest acts.",
"She pauses to listen.",
"She dared not look upon the sea again.",
"Neither his education nor his professions nor his practice could excuse him.",
"It is, moreover, interesting, as being the first public notice of him who for half a century has exercised more pens than any other artist.",
"Hospitals are necessary, and just because they are necessary therefore they cannot be evils.",
"With certain evils men must be more or less patient.",
"She assures herself that all is in its place.",
"She stops and fixes her keen black eyes upon her own worn face.",
"She fixes her eyes on her aunt as if not understanding their meaning.",
"Who has dared to couple her name with any other man?",
"To marry a wife who would be pointed at with whispered words!",
"His voice sounded like the cry of a hunted animal.",
"He dared do no more.",
"She dared not question her happiness.",
"She dared not raise them.",
"It is only immediate advantages or immediate evils that set the people in action, and for these a sound policy cannot wait.",
"Then over the medicine, he contested nothing.",
"The other leaned against a tree hard by.",
"With this weight on his head he will go down rough places almost at a run and never miss his footing.",
"He seems to have no eye but for the single point at which he is aiming.",
"He never dared to say anything to her.",
"She kissed his hand again, and leaned her head on his shoulder.",
"The flying fish is the staff of life for all the other breeds.",
"Nor was it all dreaming.",
"I remember her eyes were wild, her hair down and flying, as she bent over him and whispered in his ear.",
"When it was enough, in his judgment, and more than enough, he grew quieter, left her released, and stretched out on the surface.",
"Hers, neither of the strongest nor the weakest, yielded to the burden, and began to sink.",
"After love it is the one great surprise that life preserves for us.",
"I am so hunted I had near forgotten.",
"The farther I advanced, the greater in numbers were the people of this sort who flowed together on one road.",
"And I dared to think of good myself!",
"They had hunted him up.",
"He also fixes the hunting arrangements and the festivals."],

["This circumstance I little regretted, their manners and conversation being the reverse of interesting.",
"The love of rule is in him, and he lays his little hands on power.",
"His subjects are all men with needs, and all men with products of the land, the coasts, the sea, or brain, or skill.",
"They are the implements by which each brain is to be trained to do great work for the one in whom it lives.",
"What a train of new thoughts, hopes, and desires, did this intelligence excite in me!",
"Some of the crew froze.",
"This was the programme every day during the dog watch.",
"We all sprang to our feet and fell to talking at once.",
"We caught seals for a month or so.",
"I learned curious facts about seals in those days.",
"For the moment I did not realise what it could be.",
"At once a new doubt sprang up in our minds.",
"Full of dead seals.",
"Of a sudden I realised that I was being embraced.",
"Serve with cold meats.",
"Serve at once with meats.",
"The colour rushed into her cheeks as she held out her hand to me.",
"Few people realise the effect such words have on the speaker.",
"He stamped his foot like an angry child as he imagined her in her thin summer clothes.",
"It made her cheeks pink again.",
"All the people of the village swore they had not done it.",
"It was prettier because more rolling.",
"A man whom they asked declared he was too old to guide them, another on being commanded to lead them ran off shouting and alarmed the village.",
"She sprang up.",
"Large, hot tears sprang to her eyes.",
"She sprang at him.",
"Red had popped out in her cheeks.",
"The week raced with her funds.",
"He sleeps only at night.",
"Before I could speak, however, the mother and her daughters sprang between the men and me.",
"This programme was faithfully and completely carried out.",
"The lady sleeps!",
"My love, she sleeps!",
"Everything I did was wrong, and once he swore at me.",
"And that, in brief, had been the programme.",
"In trying to explain the conditions up here, I have my chief difficulty in making them realise the great distances we have to cover.",
"They forgot that baby because he is good and sleeps late.",
"But he sprang up.",
"Else to stand by him, every man has swore.",
"They realised much from that visit.",
"The children are thus helped to realise that other countries exist where the people were far ahead of those in this country, and they can begin to understand how social conditions vary, and how nations act upon each other.",
"The school garden is a common feature in the country, and it is to be regretted so few even of the plot description are to be found in town schools.",
"The long man silenced her.",
"I had lived so long with my scheme that I had come to look upon it almost like a trading venture, in which one calculates risks and gains on paper, and thinks no more of it.",
"But that was no hour to think of love, I took every man apart and swore him, though there was little need, to stand by the girl at all costs.",
"He bent his head, and then sprang up and held his hands high, speaking in a strange tongue.",
"From where she stood she commanded a full view of the tennis court, on which she could see that a warm set of singles was in progress.",
"Her cheeks burned, her eyes were full of tears.",
"A great faith in this man sprang up in my breast.",
"They went where he directed them, and did what he commanded, and moved at a touch.",
"I sprang back, and my heart stopped beating.",
"I sprang to my feet, and then I sat down again.",
"He resolved on active measures in stemming the tendency of his day.",
"Would I had wings to fly where ills no longer press!",
"It was true, probably the precise truth, but it seemed to have been volunteered in a rather remarkable way and worded with careful purpose.",
"The guard sprang forward in alarm.",
"She is prettier, healthier and happier now, and so proud of her fine children.",
"At length the girl raised her hand and silenced her with a gesture.",
"And he sprang to his feet.",
"Also, it eased his mind.",
"But his passion excused him.",
"And as he sprang his gun went up with his hand in a line of light.",
"A bright spot of color had come in his cheeks, but his face was as hard as ever.",
"Then, as soon as everything is finished, the brain lets go and the body sleeps like a log.",
"He sprang out into the air with all his might.",
"They fished from a flat boat.",
"I replied to him that my master had given me so much to perform that day, and that I must therefore faithfully complete it in that time.",
"I sprang up.",
"She sleeps in peace.",
"He sleeps in peace.",
"Followed more cries and angry shouts.",
"The other sprang after him.",
"He sprang for the bridge!",
"The first officer commanded a charge on the bridge.",
"When the letter was written we wrote the address on the envelope the same way, and stamped it.",
"But we are more likely to get at the truth by threatening to arrest him than by arresting him.",
"She sprang from her seat and followed him to the window.",
"I sank to the floor as I fully realised this.",
"Did she realise this?",
"In his sleep he was leaping again at the end of his chain.",
"A gray leaping form joined them from behind.",
"Then she sprang to her feet and ran out through the tent opening.",
"One of the animals sprang up and approached.",
"With shouts the men rushed in.",
"Her cheeks were thin.",
"My cheeks were flooded with a sea of tears.",
"They both went out, and he swore that if she made the slightest noise he would kill her.",
"He commanded the people again to remove the stones, that they might see what sort of animal had been put to death.",
"He commanded them to consult the stars, and to report their answer.",
"He commanded me to open my desk, and carefully examined all the papers it contained.",
"He never once swore, however, during the whole interview.",
"I need hardly say that he kept up all his old friendships.",
"I almost regretted for the moment that I was in the service.",
"I opened my mouth to protest, but he silenced me with a gesture.",
"I watched him until the trees hid him from sight, and then sprang upon my horse and started forward.",
"He had greatly feared that all could not be right, and now his anxieties were but too well justified.",
"Yet he did not even then realise to the full the significance of our capture of the town.",
"Nothing escapes the eye or the ear.",
"The officer sprang up.",
"The temperature fell, and it froze again.",
"Later on I began to realise that it would not be as easy as it looked.",
"It seemed to me a trace more of color had mounted to her cheeks.",
"There, as he had said, was the paper, with the same red seals that I had admired the previous evening.",
"It is a decision too often regretted in the light of after events.",
"Then he swore.",
"Mine should be found among her belongings.",
"He snaps the locks.",
"His army met with a series of defeats.",
"He defeats his own purpose.",
"I never looked prettier, I am sure.",
"He did not answer for a long time, but sat reading her mobile face until a gentler look came into his hard blue eyes.",
"She seemed to be far gone in some exhausting illness.",
"He now regretted that feeling.",
"Now the sound was getting louder.",
"The women seemed to look prettier than ever.",
"Surely a prettier girl could not exist.",
"Nor are there in the trusts declared after her death.",
"But their hopes were not to be realised.",
"As might be expected, friendships were formed with those who had tastes in common.",
"But she soon realised that true joys were not to be found in the mere attractions of society.",
"After him came a shower of clothes and bedding.",
"She handed him her programme.",
"She was tracing with the tip of her finger a pattern stamped on the binding of the book.",
"Her friendship once secured was a thing worth possessing.",
"They were waving arms and implements above their heads.",
"Then came a sound that froze me!",
"With a scream of joy we both sprang for the prize.",
"He knows them all well, and looks them in the face, and lays his hand on their backs daily.",
"This he did in a quiet, gentler manner, such that it seemed as if he would hardly have behaved otherwise.",
"He told me how different everything used to be in the castle grounds and that he regretted not understanding about these matters.",
"He was given a piece of copy and worked faithfully until the paper went to press.",
"There were some very narrow escapes, but no accidents of a very serious nature.",
"He commanded the machine gun company with us.",
"It had, however, many narrow escapes.",
"Disorder immediately defeats itself.",
"All listened closely, and again and again the woods rang with shouts of laughter.",
"Suddenly she seemed to realise that it was dead, and again threw her eyes up at us.",
"Here there was certainly more light, but only just sufficient to realise the horrible surroundings of the place.",
"I see too much of it in my work not to realise it.",
"There was not a single second to spare, for hard behind me the boat grounded and several dark forms sprang after me.",
"While I thus spoke, he realised that I was with him.",
"One thing I have never heard discussed, but it is the clearest gain of all, and already it may be called a certain gain.",
"Flow gently, sweet river, the theme of my lays!",
"I must try to get her on the programme, too.",
"Such, however, as it is, I give it to the world, having fulfilled, I believe, every one of the conditions imposed upon me by my late and deeply regretted friend.",
"My protest was very quickly silenced.",
"But such a feeling she could not realise.",
"Where was this paper stamped?",
"These feelings found expression in our talk and shouts.",
"He sprang up, sending dishes to the floor with a crash.",
"It struck him then what few belongings he really had.",
"But it was such a driving passion that no man possessing it and free to the violence of war could ever escape death.",
"She felt the blood hot in her cheeks.",
"It inspires a man and lifts his head.",
"But I am not leaping at conclusions.",
"Another gray form blocked his leaping way.",
"Dirty children in the street have red cheeks and good teeth.",
"She regretted, she said, that she knew so little of what was done in our country.",
"Never had her mind raced so.",
"She sprang up to face him.",
"King stamped the loose snow from his boots and came in.",
"The blood was red and hot in her cheeks.",
"She sprang up and built a fire.",
"Now her thoughts raced again.",
"Now as he looked up at her his eyes and all that she could see of his face were stamped with that which lay in his heart.",
"She sprang up and called to him over and over.",
"She gave it to him, smiled at him, commanded him to go back to sleep, promising to talk with him in the morning.",
"In another moment she would have the lean powerful body leaping upon her.",
"They fished in the stream by day and set lines by night.",

"Now, that was no easy adventure of faith, and those who thus adventured could not hope for material gain.",
"Let the bones be cut short and see that it is properly jointed before it is laid down to the fire, as they will be more easily separated when they come to table.",
"A keener mind fell into the same error.",
"I ain't never been used to the like of that!",
"It ain't a square deal.",
"I ain't got no belief in them.",
"Grand day, ain't it?",
"Ain't this hell?",
"He ain't got no human in him.",

"We ain't divided yet.",
"His eyes aren't equal to his nose.",
"It only frightens and angers them.",
"Ain't I seen it done many a time?",
"Ain't it awful?",
"I, who have still his firmest champion stood?",
"Outside of that he sure ain't no good.",
"Ain't that clear?",
"I ain't got a quick tongue and sharp eyes, and they been treating me like I was a kid all my life.",
"No, he ain't that way.",
"He ain't.",
"Ain't I glad about him!",
"Ain't he my own blessed boy?",
"Of our late equipments, I know not from whom the charge can be very properly expected.",
"She ain't no folks of her own, nor much means, and ought to marry a man who can make things easy for her.",
"But why should I attempt to analyse a character so familiar?",
"Going to the root of the matter, not one man really practises such a religion, because we do destroy life.",
"They will be able to do so only by following the firmest and the most consistent policy.",
"On his return home from these services he would spend the day in an upper room, without a fire, even in the severest weather, writing a minute account of all that had happened.",
"I ain't up to the tricks.",
"He ain't much for showing off.",
"How am I blest!",
"Blest cross!",
"I ain't blind.",
"That ain't much to ask.",
"Their vision is keener than that of other men.",
"She ain't afraid of anything or anybody.",
"I ain't one of them that never prepares for anything.",
"Look, aren't they sweet?",
"Why analyse?",
"When I read a letter myself I sometimes read things which aren't there.",
"He ain't a talking man.",
"There aren't any.",
"Dog trials aren't in my line.",
"Aren't they all right?",
"Recent advices from this country show that the conditions there are now somewhat improved.",
"He ain't got no other name.",
"I ain't got any money.",

"No man practises so well as he writes.",
"Draughts must be avoided.",
"We aren't afraid of her.",
"But the room seemed even emptier without her than it had in the morning.",
"I have analysed tears!",

"Well, I ain't.",
"Ain't it sunk in yet?",
"I swear they ain't.",
"They ain't no rat in that hole.",

"It ain't valuable enough.",
"Beyond there they ain't any tracks.",
"He ain't hurt bad.",
"We ain't got time.",
"But that ain't the point.",
"Habits of industry were destroyed, and all respect for employments that required labor.",

["We didn't expect it at all.",
"She didn't say anything.",
"I have heard men say who didn't care about him particularly, and who were not at all of his way of thinking, that they would rather not discuss with him.",
"The rooms were so high up that we didn't hear the noise of the street, but the river looked alive and friendly with the lights on the bridges, and a few boats still running.",
"He was always a striking figure, didn't look as if he belonged to our modern world at all.",
"Everybody can't be invited to the various entertainments and distinctions are very hard to make.",
"I didn't quite understand their view of the situation.",
"He had been named to a post which he couldn't really accept.",
"It didn't feel as if a fire could make any impression.",
"His life is centred in that star.",
"They didn't get it.",
"I can't solve it.",
"His whole force of being was centred on his discovery.",
"Besides, I didn't believe that the island was there.",
"Or if he did, he didn't want to tell.",
"I couldn't move him a hair.",
"Pretty soon the boat began to move up the lake in a way I didn't at all like.",
"What to do I didn't know.",
"There was no snow on the ground, and I couldn't get at his track.",
"He didn't seem to understand the matter at all, and I didn't undertake to explain the reason of my being there.",
"Instead of camping out, as I usually do, I then chanced to be stopping at the house of a friend.",
"He didn't want any body else to know more than himself, and he didn't want to know more than any body else.",
"I couldn't stand it much longer.",
"The play is really good, and I can't find much fault with the acting.",
"But he can't.",
"She didn't say I ought to see it.",
"Fancy, I didn't know about him!",
"He couldn't.",
"She says she can't bear me to.",
"She didn't want him to go.",
"The trouble was I couldn't go there very well until I was asked.",
"And I can't bear it.",
"She didn't know what to do to get rid of it!",
"Couldn't they go on seeing each other just as friends?",
"He didn't answer.",
"And yet he didn't really care for women.",
"He didn't appreciate her fine shades, he was not in love with her, didn't value her as another man might have done.",
"I can't stand that woman.",
"I can't say anything else.",
"I didn't think of that name once as I lay upon the hill.",
"Only I can't get it into words.",
"Can't wait!",
"I can't get my thoughts together!",
"I can't stop myself.",
"I couldn't let well enough alone.",
"I couldn't!",
"I didn't mean it.",
"I didn't!",
"I can't stand no more.",
"The factory can't turn out the orders fast enough at that price.",
"Didn't mean to.",
"He can't keep his hands off.",
"I can't possibly work.",
"A few weeks later everybody who had laughed was sorry, and those who only wanted to laugh were glad they didn't.",
"I can't tell who may have got a ticket and been present.",
"But he didn't go.",
"They can't live without their sweet and attractive little sister.",
"I didn't hear of his saying anything else.",
"However, the audience can't hear.",
"Everybody seems glad to greet me, particularly at this time, and all express regrets that I couldn't have come earlier in the season.",
"Of course I didn't mean that.",
"But they can't keep me from doing so now!",
"When I got there I couldn't speak.",
"I can't get over it.",
"I couldn't have done it.",
"But he couldn't sleep.",
"It didn't concern him.",
"Whether they liked it or whether they didn't, for them there was no way out.",
"It didn't work.",
"As a matter of fact, they didn't.",
"It was the one battle we found didn't pay.",
"No, he didn't think so.",
"But he didn't seem to think so.",
"And he didn't give it up, either, though he admitted long after it was the toughest time he had ever put in in all his life.",
"This man didn't seem to be.",
"They couldn't sleep.",
"Couldn't agree.",
"He couldn't hear what was said in reply, but he shook his head.",
"But I cannot laugh, because my upper lip seems to be made of leather and I can't move it.",
"I didn't know that.",
"I want them to get the feeling of beautiful colour, so I shall show them a book with the colours graded in it, and we shall each have a paper and paint on it all the rich colours we can think of.",
"If they are not tired of painting I want to show them a painted circle to turn on a string and they can make these for themselves, using the colours they have already used.",
"They asked to see it, so I showed it and suggested painting the colours ourselves.",
"They all enjoyed it very much, especially the different colours made where the colours ran into each other.",
"By means of discoveries of this kind they will see new colours in life around them, and a new depth of meaning will come to their everyday observations.",
"It rained all afternoon, and we couldn't do anything.",
"It didn't look so one sided now.",
"But, of course, he couldn't ask.",
"And we can't run a light.",
"I can't stand this.",
"I can't bear it!",
"I can't rest for thinking of it.",
"I can't laugh as I should like to.",
"He can't be far from me!",
"I didn't know that!",
"I didn't dare show a light, though I had one.",
"He couldn't give me any very clear description of what he found in the eyes.",
"I didn't see it.",
"Can't be!",
"Yet I knew very well we couldn't stay here all winter and run it.",
"The battle can't be far off.",
"I can't go a step farther.",
"Didn't he believe that there were men there?",
"We can't go right on the cars?",
"But the men didn't seem to mind it much.",
"We can't afford to try the other now, at any rate.",
"Our boat can't be far off.",
"What chance would I have if I didn't?",
"We can't go, however, just yet.",
"I can't bear it.",
"No, that can't be the signal.",
"I can't think it.",
"I couldn't think of taking so much money.",
"Men can't disappear like this, leaving no record.",
"She didn't understand in the least what he meant about justice being done.",
"I can't see him now!",
"Didn't I do exactly the same thing?",
"She couldn't for the time being see straight.",
"Didn't take no interest in his work no more.",
"He found himself in a large room which, before he could examine a single feature of it, was effectively curtained from his sight.",
"No, I can't take chances like that.",
"He didn't say a word.",
"I can't.",
"If I didn't own that plot of ground next door, this place would be impossible.",
"I couldn't help seeing it.",
"And I can't use it!",
"But we can't discuss it here in the street.",
"I can't understand either why it was done or how it was done.",
"And to think I didn't see it!",
"He can't make me do that!",
"What I said just now didn't look as though I appreciated it.",
"He didn't carry anything with him.",
"Yet I couldn't hardly go to anybody with it.",
"He cupped his hands about her beautiful, fair face and lifted it, studying it.",
"When it is used in washing clothes, it is called bluing.",
"Hurt her foot, had to stop, and then couldn't make good time.",
"Somehow, I didn't like the fellow.",
"He told me to look him up at the office, but I didn't go.",
"Funny I didn't think of that.",
"I didn't know it was going to be as easy as all that.",
"I couldn't do a thing like that, sir.",
"First of all, I didn't drive him home.",
"That is, I did drive him home, but he didn't go inside.",
"As he didn't move I got down and opened the door.",
"He got out, and paid me, but I couldn't see that he had been crying, and he looked much as usual, so far as I could see.",
"I couldn't go myself, there being the shop to look after.",
"He didn't wait to see any more, but he turned and ran out of the house.",
"I tried to, but I couldn't.",
"If she found the man dead, why didn't she inform the police?",
"I couldn't sleep in my bed of nights for thinking of them, sir.",
"They couldn't expect us to have a man looking through the window or hiding behind the door when the murder was committed.",
"I didn't have any particular reason.",
"But they didn't.",
"And he didn't like that either.",
"I had mastered him so quickly, and was able to handle him so easily, that I didn't watch him as closely as I ought to have done.",
"This is the blindest case that has ever been put in my hands.",
"I couldn't somehow.",
"I can't stand it a minute longer.",
"I can't believe no bad of him.",
"I didn't listen and I didn't see what happened, but it was something out of the ordinary.",
"I didn't dare.",
"I didn't carry it there.",
"She didn't like my late hours, or the condition in which I frequently came home.",
"I noticed it among the others, but I didn't touch it then.",
"He didn't approve, but I persuaded him.",
"I didn't know how I could ever turn around again and see my sister lying there behind me, with her face fixed in death, for which I was, in a way, responsible.",
"I couldn't have forgotten it, if she had done that.",
"But I didn't have any light when I went for the coat and hat.",
"Can't help it, can we?",
"I can't trust him.",
"He drove me down, but for love or money I couldn't get him to return.",
"I just simply can't live another minute without a man in the house.",
"Sometimes he could, and sometimes he couldn't.",
"I can't understand it.",
"There was one system only, and his failure to provide defences in depth cost him dear.",
"They took whatever they could lay their hands on, and we, the servants, couldn't stop them.",
"We couldn't do it.",
"Why didn't they put over gas shell?",
"Why didn't they bomb us?",
"Fact is, I went home late, and didn't bother about letters this morning.",
"I can't taste anything.",
"Can't be helped.",
"Perhaps he didn't care.",
"He didn't abandon the role, of course.",
"But I can't, unfortunately.",
"I didn't lead him on an inch.",
"I couldn't help it.",
"What else didn't he know, or couldn't he do?",
"But he didn't like her.",
"It can't go away in such a storm as this.",
"Why didn't they leave him at home with his mother?",
"He counselled resistance.",
"I can't be dead!",
"But he didn't wait to hear this explanation.",
"But he didn't.",
"I didn't like that.",
"I offered to buy the dog, but the boy didn't dare sell him.",
"Well, I can't go.",
"It was not his business to criticise his employers.",
"I can't believe it!",
"It couldn't be.",
"I can't do that.",
"I couldn't bear it.",
"The defences were simple.",
"I couldn't.",
"But until now I didn't get much out of what I knew.",
"And yet I can't see how they get along.",
"He didn't like it, but it will do him good.",
"But I can't believe he will.",
"I didn't realize things were so bad here.",
"But they couldn't have it.",
"And it is a church that can't ever make good any more.",
"It might, at the beginning, but it can't now.",
"But we can't tackle everything.",
"He didn't know.",
"Gray and pale blue, for instance, do not combine well, both being cold colours.",
"If he found it so necessary, why didn't he do it himself, they thought, remaining seated.",
"I have to go so far away and I can't help it.",
"Can't we stay up a little longer?",
"If we can't do anything for ourselves, it seems as if everything would have to be that way.",
"No, no, this can't be.",
"But when the others are all in school she can't be left alone.",
"I wanted so much to find out where he was, and asked him to tell me, but he thought it would not help, as we couldn't possibly go to him.",
"I feel as if I couldn't rest till everything is set in order.",
"He didn't answer me then.",
"I can't describe it.",
"Then in the night came the charges, and one night I couldn't count them.",
"Who can't be silent, and who will not lie.",
"They can't fool me.",
"It looks as if we didn't care for her, and we do.",
"I couldn't stay out the week.",
"Can't he run?",
"We breakfasted earlier than usual.",
"For their weapons are those against which no distance, no defences, no numbers afford protection.",
"I can't prove it yet, but I feel it.",
"I can't hire any more, because I can't trust these strangers.",
"But I can't go.",
"Why, I can't understand that.",
"I didn't make love to him.",
"It looked as if he didn't need any.",
"I can't forget.",
"He didn't die.",
"But I didn't give in, which I feel now was a mistake.",
"But I didn't care for the doctors in charge.",
"He couldn't speak very well.",
"They say we can't write home anything about the war.",
"I couldn't breathe.",
"But I couldn't keep back my thoughts.",
"He couldn't fight.",
"But he can't fool me.",
"I couldn't hear myself think.",
"I didn't know it when we met.",
"What the name means I can't say.",
"Yet it chanced I saw almost nothing of her.",
"I heard her presence on board discussed several times by others of our company, but it somehow chanced that during my time in the open she was usually below.",
"He didn't wait for me to question him.",
"He didn't do the job, but I believe I know who did.",
"It didn't seem as though anything wrong could happen.",
"I am so sorry that I can't stay up here always and always.",
"That they didn't even know where to go?",
"They breakfasted in silence, the fire between them.",
"I can't say any more than that, can I?",
"I couldn't climb up there.",
"But he couldn't lie still.",
"It can't go wrong and stay wrong.",
"She said some could learn, and some couldn't.",
"My stars, I remember the time women didn't bother no more about politics than a yellow dog does about religion.",
"I can't think who would do this.",
"I simply can't live without her.",
"Is there any reason why I can't hope to win her?",
"I can't give her up!",
"No, it didn't take me long.",
"No indeed, she couldn't take any one to board.",
"He was sorry enough after, but that didn't bring them back.",
"He thought the election would pull me down, but it didn't.",
"The people said the woods were full of game, but we didn't have time to go hunting.",
"I didn't wonder that they laughed.",
"However, he said he didn't mind.",
"If any one invited her to come and see them and didn't want me, she would stay at home.",
"The men didn't like her, and couldn't manage her.",
"Their legs are so long that they can't eat close to the ground.",
"She watched for a while, and when he didn't come back, she flew upon the back of a chair that stood near the door, and put her head under her wing.",
"They couldn't keep me home.",
"The weather was hot and sometimes we couldn't sleep, and they had to go up on the roof.",
"He was only with the dog a little while, and didn't think he would take it, but it seemed he knew what an easy thing it was to get.",
"She couldn't remember much after that.",
"Say, we couldn't stand for that, so we just sailed in and made him a prisoner.",
"We didn't hurt him much, no more than he did us.",
"I can't hardly move, and I think my arm is broken.",
"Didn't he bring one with him?",
"I didn't know what to make of that, but fancied somebody else in camp had taken it.",
"But I didn't mean that.",
"I didn't want my name painted on.",
"We may believe that the common man can govern, or we may believe that he can't.",
"Though how he managed to change his clothes and put on such a nice coat, I can't imagine.",
"Thus alarmed, they counselled together upon the course it would be wisest to adopt.",
"Anyway, the boat didn't have any power.",
"Our troop was broke and we couldn't spare the money, because we needed all we had for eats and things.",
"All of a sudden I saw it was pitch dark and I couldn't see any boats at all, only lights, moving a little on account of the boats rocking.",
"I told him no, and asked him who he was and what he wanted, but he didn't say anything, only tied his boat, and climbed up over the rail.",
"A fellow couldn't help listening to him.",
"Didn't even dare to go up to the house and ask about it.",
"Suppose my sister knew I was within a quarter of a mile of the house and didn't go to see them.",
"Anyway, he didn't ask and that was one good thing.",
"Poor little kid, he didn't know it either.",
"It made me feel awful sorry for him, because his suit didn't fit him and looked kind of funny.",
"All I know is that he couldn't think about a lot of things.",
"Even still he didn't pay any attention, he was so excited.",
"Why didn't they tell him in the beginning about those other things.",
"Anyway, I guess he didn't care, he was always so crazy about what he was doing.",
"It was wide enough so the rain didn't come in and wet us as long as we stayed way back near the windows.",
"We looked all over, but couldn't see him anywhere.",
"He can't make it.",
"I heard the fellows shouting, but I didn't pay any attention.",
"But he didn't say anything about it.",
"He didn't want me to come over and ask, but I told him I was going to, anyway.",
"Even he couldn't stop me.",
"I just couldn't help saying it.",
"I couldn't say anything, so I just kept still.",
"I guess maybe it was because I couldn't come right out and tell him the plain truth about that key.",
"Pretty soon I made up my mind to do something that I didn't want to do.",
"I didn't go on the boat, because I had no right to, and because there was no need to.",
"I didn't know he had any key.",
"I got hold of his tracks just because I didn't want him to come to any harm while he was all worked up.",
"Anyway, we didn't pay any attention to them.",
"I can't do any more alone, I can't.",
"He looked at me steady, but didn't say a word.",
"Only we didn't know it.",
"If he didn't own the moon, it was because he couldn't reach it.",
"Now I didn't know what had happened, except that the whole country was under water.",
"It was all dark down there and I couldn't see.",
"For about half a minute he didn't answer.",
"Then for about a minute he didn't speak.",
"I didn't know what he was doing.",
"It didn't lead anywhere at all.",
"And I just couldn't call and I felt sick, as if I was going to fall right down.",
"I didn't want to see them and I didn't want to hear anything more.",
"And now I couldn't even do that.",
"We were going to prove he didn't take the money.",
"I didn't care much what he did.",
"His own troop didn't seem to think so much about it.",
"They didn't seem to get excited over him at all.",
"I didn't know whether he had sent for the cross or not.",
"I just didn't want to go unless I had the letter.",
"I just started out through the woods, because I didn't want to see anybody.",
"Even though I didn't feel much like laughing, I had to laugh.",
"I was glad I didn't say any more, because anyway, there was no letter there.",
"I just couldn't listen to them.",
"Honest, I couldn't finish.",
"Pretty soon everybody in camp was talking, but I didn't pay any attention.",
"I noticed they didn't have their door to the south, but anyway, that didn't matter.",
"It seemed as if that train didn't care for anything or anybody.",
"I didn't say anything, just looked at the river.",
"The rest of us didn't even try to compete.",
"The boys didn't know about her.",
"Silly or not, I just can't seem to!",
"He didn't altogether like it, but didn't say anything.",
"The big fellows didn't seem able to stand it long.",
"I mean, we can't carry these long faces to the club, can we?",
"I didn't have my spelling or my examples.",
"I told him I didn't wonder.",
"And I can't see the good.",
"But I can't forget.",
"They didn't come out of my stock.",
"I didn't mean to!",
"Well, when he comes back home all shot up he tries to get his sons to take my trail, but they didn't have the nerve.",
"He didn't.",
"He didn't want the law to hang me.",
"He pitched onto his face, and then hanged if he didn't get up on one arm and one leg and throw himself at me.",
"I couldn't do a thing.",
"And he wondered why I didn't work the same way!",
"He didn't mind anything else so very much.",
"He seen that he could get me off whenever he wanted to and he seen that I didn't do him no harm when I got on.",
"I may have tripped him which I didn't mean to.",
"But she didn't dream how much I knew.",
"Whatever it might turn out to be, it would find him prepared, he couldn't be surprised.",
"He really couldn't make her out.",
"Then he put a few questions, which the children, who were busy breakfasting, did not hear.",
"And so, as we passed the house just now, we couldn't resist calling.",
"I can't keep a child like that with nobody to help me.",
"But then, that doctor who chose her didn't ask my opinion.",
"Yet I can't nurse her now, it is too late.",
"I didn't intend to repeat it, but the next day he cried again, and so I had to continue, worse luck for me!",
"Why can't she leave us alone, the boy and me?",
"But it can't be helped.",
"I couldn't sleep thinking of her.",
"They couldn't live like that, a gentleman must have somebody to look after him.",
"I couldn't have dared to ask it.",
"The crew can't help themselves, after that.",
"I couldn't, I know.",
"I can't think why.",
"The colours are in reality extremely brilliant, but the medium through which they are seen increases the effect surprisingly.",
"I didn't feel like telling him that I had no idea of how to go about doing this.",
"Another time, we all went to see a dance performance that I didn't understand too much about.",
"What is much read will be much criticised.",
"Seeing the colours, he imagined all was right.",
"There they breakfasted.",
"I didn't stop to note the color of his uniform.",
"I didn't know I had lost it.",
"She was satisfied with both connexions.",
"They didn't care for country justices, not they.",
"Can't they read?",
"I can't help it.",
"I didn't pose for such a part.",
"She laughed until the tears coursed down her pretty cheeks.",
"He didn't say this.",
"I felt it, I knew it all along, but I couldn't help it.",
"I knew I ought to do something, but, child, I didn't know what to do.",
"Where was I to meet women when I didn't even know men?",
"And we couldn't.",
"I didn't, but I was mad all the same.",
"I can't analyse it.",
"I didn't choose her.",
"We didn't have much luck.",
"I fancy what went before didn't count for much.",
"I can't wait for that.",
"I didn't start out to be.",
"He can't!",
"Well, I couldn't.",
"It didn't seem possible to get any further.",
"People didn't live in the clouds.",
"I didn't know what it meant.",
"I can't help asking.",
"I didn't see them.",
"It didn't suit her, so I came back again.",
"But there was one thing I didn't reckon upon.",
"I couldn't get their mothers to send them clean.",
"I can't realise anything.",
"A wife can't give evidence against her husband!",
"And it may be added here that she didn't.",
"He laughed and worked, but we couldn't make it.",
"I didn't.",
"I meant to shoot him, but I didn't.",
"Having engaged them, he was certain to get plenty of work out of them, and they couldn't leave till they had earned sufficient money to take themselves elsewhere.",
"But I had to explain to him that I was retiring from business that very day, and did not wish to enter into even a single deal, and that, therefore, I couldn't do anything.",
"To start with they didn't want us to come.",
"He couldn't explain it.",
"I can't remember.",
"It didn't matter!",
"He couldn't blame her.",
"She can't!",
"Why can't I there my days for ever spend?",
"I didn't see much of it from the train.",
"I can't explain.",
"Though I didn't think as this one was one of that kind.",
"It chanced that the men of the majority kept on the right side of the street, and the men of the minority on the left.",
"Its function is to keep the imagination centred in the right direction.",
"I can't understand why the man died so easily.",
"They can't help us in any way.",
"Why, we can't stay here all night and freeze.",
"He suspected something, he couldn't tell exactly what, and he didn't propose to commit himself.",
"They didn't know, but they had a degree of faith.",
"They chanced to be alone at the time.",
"He seemed to have the flying colours on his lips.",
"For how long or how safe, I can't tell.",
"The show can't possibly survive.",
"He said the letter was to a boy who would never know his good luck if they didn't tell him.",
"I see the reason now, though I didn't suspect it then.",
"One day last week I chanced to see his mother.",
"One day I chanced to speak to her of a mutual friend, long dead.",
"Of course, I couldn't allow that.",
"Didn't I write it?",
"Things had to be worked out, and sometimes his brain didn't seem to move very quickly.",
"I didn't really want to stay, but it came about.",
"But she didn't!",
"He couldn't alter her, or what she would think.",
"He could say it now, when she couldn't hear.",
"Me, I didn't propose it.",
"Didn't have time to talk long with him.",
"Why didn't they try to explain?",
"She sure didn't fly away.",
"Can't be that.",
"Quickly they breakfasted and loaded.",
"Knew I couldn't trust him.",
"I didn't ask him to go.",
"I said right away I couldn't accept.",
"He sat by me and didn't speak at first.",
"He didn't seem to hear, and then he turned suddenly, with one of his nice smiles.",
"But I didn't care.",
"But I couldn't help it.",
"I didn't wait to go home.",
"Why couldn't I have thought of that danger?",
"He couldn't keep away.",
"His eyes looked as if the light had suddenly gone out of them, and I couldn't bear that.",
"Our shadows couldn't have fallen on the curtain.",
"I couldn't keep away.",
"Indeed, I did guess, but I couldn't be sure, so I saw him.",
"I didn't know what I would do.",
"Nobody who didn't expect to find a man would have noticed me in the darkness.",
"A moment later someone, I couldn't see who, opened the gate and let him in.",
"In an outside pocket of my coat, however, I chanced upon something for the existence of which I couldn't account.",
"So did I, but I didn't mean to let her know that.",
"But this time she didn't even try to defend herself.",
"I can't make out.",
"I couldn't imagine ever being really pleased about anything again.",
"But I didn't care enough to humour her.",
"It was almost as if he had had some kind of previous knowledge of the affair, of which he didn't wish to speak.",
"I can't stand it.",
"I can't sleep.",
"I think that I had not slept at all, but that didn't matter.",
"He didn't see the case, as he handed it to me, nor could I.",
"We can't allow either race to be lost in favor of the other.",
"Or maybe that he felt I didn't deserve to have anything he didn't.",
"Maybe they didn't know how good I really was?",
"Finally, I just couldn't stand it any longer.",
"I didn't say anything to anybody that evening.",
"But because of the way they scored then, I didn't get credit for one of them.",
"It didn't work out, though.",
"But it can't be!",
"I knew it before the company left, but I didn't say a word.",
"I didn't have any of it.",
"I didn't understand.",
"Of course I couldn't remain at the school after that.",
"I told her I didn't think anything of a long walk, and insisted on going further with her.",
"Didn't he know the train she was to take?",
"Day or night I can't get him out of my mind.",
"He can't be very particular.",
"I went up with her dinner but she didn't take any.",
"She can't be well.",
"So it can't just be imagination.",
"Naturally I didn't like to go so far as to ask his name.",
"Mother advised taking no notice at all and I have tried not to, but I can't keep it up.",
"She never understands why I can't lend it to her.",
"I can't come out.",
"She couldn't act as if she was ashamed of him, could she?",
"We can't push it.",
"They can't talk.",
"But she didn't seem to care.",
"But I can't die without it.",
"I can't help reading what I feel.",
"He didn't know why he said it except that he wanted to say something, something which might make her look at him.",
"It can't be a boy!",
"I didn't know.",
"She didn't know.",
"I couldn't keep it up.",
"But it didn't.",
"I asked a girl to ask her father who was a lawyer if a marriage was legal when the girl was under age and the parents didn't know about it.",
"I couldn't hold out against mother.",
"My friends didn't ask him to the party they gave for me.",
"Did they mean that one couldn't have any human god at all?",
"I knew there must be some explanation and it didn't seem wrong to ask.",
"I didn't mean to say a word when I set out.",
"I didn't fall and hurt it.",
"I didn't listen.",
"I can't make the effort.",
"He could have told another man when to run, but he didn't know when to run himself.",
"It can't be done.",
"She can't go back on it now.",
"Such things didn't happen outside of short stories.",
"Didn't I even name its color before it came into sight?",
"I didn't want to come.",
"He didn't know anything about motors.",
"I told her she couldn't get a train until morning.",
"I didn't like the hotel.",
"As to the secretary, I can't say.",
"Couldn't be beaten by a professional.",
"But he didn't get into his motor, though it was waiting for him.",
"All the same I didn't mean to fill a ship at a single bid in this fashion.",
"At any rate, they didn't give it to us.",
"She didn't give me any time to hold her hand, she was so busy.",
"We breakfasted together next morning, and then the coach came, and took him up.",
"The old ladies didn't know whether to be angry or pleased.",
"He never came down to the village, except to church, where he sat away from everybody, in the gallery curtained off.",
"I can't think what it is.",
"I didn't know my father had left things in such a mess.",
"Of course I can't deny I did lead her to hope I should be always with her.",
"But a man can't help it if he happens to fall in love.",
"The fire is out and the water is cold, but it can't be helped.",
"Every thought centred in her.",
"Father died when we were both small, and didn't leave us much means beside the farm.",
"At first we couldn't sell the farm.",
"I didn't know for quite a spell where I was.",
"I can't say just how many walks she and I had taken together before this one.",
"Life can't be counted in a day.",
"I think it can't do.",
"I have been denied breakfasting with her.",
"Well, I can't help it!",
"I will bring her to own, before I have done with her, that she can't see me too often.",
"But I didn't know she was lost.",
"There can't be another mother across the sea for me.",
"I can't stand that.",
"But sometimes I can't seem to help it.",
"The worst is that I can't recall them.",
"It was only because they thought that I might be upset on hearing of the mystery that they didn't want me to go.",
"There were no other relatives available, and I couldn't have any made to order.",
"Maybe I didn't have a good business head, either.",
"Well, it can't be helped.",
"It appeared that a friend breakfasted with him.",
"It couldn't help it.",
"They can't even discover in what direction she was taken, or how.",
"But I can't do it.",
"We both can't know which of us will die, and then it would be too late.",
"All her life had been centred on him.",
"So it chanced for many days, till not one stone remained upon another.",
"He wished he didn't have to go alone, so he did.",
"She didn't, so he sang it for her.",
"Can't find out.",
"He was supposed to come, and he didn't.",
"The stranger couldn't be sure.",
"But he didn't dare.",
"She didn't have to smile at him when he spoke to her.",
"Didn't know me, he didn't!",
"Besides, I can't sleep any more myself.",
"We can't help that.",
"No, it didn't matter.",
"I know it can't.",
"He didn't know what he was talking about.",
"No, he didn't.",
"He didn't see exactly where to begin, either.",
"I couldn't see their faces.",
"I didn't dare open a window then.",
"I couldn't allow that.",
"Now there can't be many men like that.",
"But I didn't choose that that should last.",
"Perhaps I ought to have seen it coming, but I didn't.",
"But he can't change his ears.",
"Quite good reasons, but they didn't convince me.",
"They can't tell the truth.",
"I saw him at the house and didn't much like the look of him.",
"We can't say.",
"Now, I didn't want to discuss the matter here, and, besides, there was not time.",
"It couldn't have been took off for no reason.",
"He didn't feel well enough to come, and I did not urge him.",
"The church is built upon a hill, and, therefore, can't be hid.",
"But they didn't devote the whole evening to music.",
"He couldn't help it.",
"No, he didn't neither.",
"But she didn't.",
"I can't, for the life of me, help fearing that we shall be found out.",
"I can't do it.",
"I can't see that the strike has advanced the rate of increase any.",
"I can't see her face, but she seems to like it.",
"But it did seem as if I couldn't.",
"I guess the man that spoke to me about it thought I didn't fall in with it.",
"He knows he can't come to the table.",
"And what didn't we see there?",
"And we disputed back and forth several times but didn't convince each other.",
"And he said he guessed he knew what he took comfort in and what he didn't.",
"But I can't let it be a surprise.",
"No wonder they couldn't have met as if nothing had happened.",
"I can't name it.",
"I couldn't believe it.",
"We missed the observation that day, but we didn't the next.",
"I didn't believe it.",
"But I didn't know, and nobody told me.",
"I couldn't walk.",
"That is the way I felt about it, and my only excuse is that I couldn't help having a good time.",
"He didn't exactly give in.",
"Just the same, although I almost saw the old giant, I didn't quite see him.",
"We didn't bury him.",
"We couldn't get to him, and flying machines had not yet been invented.",
"He didn't make anything.",
"I can't understand every one, over here.",
"There are things every day that one can't describe.",
"I couldn't certainly do worse.",
"What has chanced?",
"He can't want me.",
"If we didn't travel now and then, we should forget what the feeling of life is.",
"I can't think how I did it or why.",
"I can't think why they do it.",
"Only I know it can't last.",
"I can't be bothered to copy the other.",
"But I can't go out!",
"And we can't.",
"And it can't be helped!",
"If I didn't, as it seems proved that I couldn't, it will never be done now.",
"And I can't think why!"
