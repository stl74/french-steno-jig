            <p>
                For finger drills and learning the keys on the steno keyboard,
                you'll want to make Plover send the raw output instead of
                translating it into words. To do this, show Plover's main window
                (<code>PHROBGS</code> is the usual chord for this, or there
                should be an icon in the task bar). Then un-check the checkboxes
                next to <code>main.json</code> and <code>user.json</code> to
                turn them off temporarily.
            </p>

            <div style="text-align: center">
                <img
                    src="plover-4.png"
                    alt="Plover main window, showing the
	dictionary list with checkboxes to disable each one."
                />
            </div>

            <hr style="margin: 2em 0px 3em" />

            <p>
                Alternatively, you can open the Plugins Manager from the Plover
                main window and install the
                <code>plover_dict_commands</code> plugin. You may need to
                restart Plover after installing the plugin? Not sure about that.
            </p>

            <p>
                Define a dictionary entry to switch to raw steno: maybe in
                <code>commands.json</code>. I think many people use
                <code>RA*U</code> as
                <code>{PLOVER:solo_dict:+commands.json}</code>. This will ensure
                that <code>commands.json</code> is enabled, and will disable all
                other dictionaries. Then you'll need a definition to enable your
                dictionaries again. The command for this is
                <code>{PLOVER:end_solo_dict}</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Personally I do this slightly differently: I have a special
                dictionary <code>return-from-raw.json</code> (which I put at the
                very bottom of the dictionary list) with the following contents:
            </p>

            <div>
                <code>
                    <pre>
{
	"RA*U": "{PLOVER:end_solo_dict}",
	"R-R": "{^~|\n^}",
	"STK-G": "{#right}"
}</pre
                    >
                </code>
            </div>

            <p>
                Then my normal <code>RA*U</code> command is
                <code>{PLOVER:solo_dict:+return-from-raw.json}</code>. So I can
                use <code>RA*U</code> to toggle raw-mode on and off, and in raw
                mode I only have Return (which you press three times to repeat
                an exercise in Steno Grade) and the right arrow (which randomly
                generates a new exercise).
